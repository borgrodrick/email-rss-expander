            <strong>Summary:</strong> This article describes a tense atmosphere in Minnesota following the deployment of federal immigration agents under the Trump administration in 2026. It highlights the fatal shooting of a nurse by federal agents, the widespread fear within Hispanic and Somali communities, and the local humanitarian efforts led by churches to support those in hiding, while suggesting the federal crackdown may be politically motivated.

It took only a few minutes before everyone in the church knew that another person had been shot. I was sitting with Trygve Olsen, a big man in a wool hat and puffy vest, who lifted his phone to show me a text with the news. It was his 50th birthday, and one of the coldest days of the year. I asked him whether he was doing anything special to celebrate. “What should I be doing?” he replied. “Should I sit at home and open presents? This is where I’m supposed to be.”

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

He had come to Iglesia Cristiana La Viña Burnsville, about 15 miles south of the Twin Cities, to pick up food for families who are too afraid to go out—some have barely left home since federal immigration agents deployed to Minnesota two months ago. The church was filled with pallets of frozen meat and vegetables, diapers, fruit, and toilet paper. Outside, a man wearing a leather biker vest bearing the insignia of the Latin American Motorcycle Association, his blond beard flecked with ice crystals, directed a line of cars through the snow.

The man who had been shot—fatally, we later learned—was Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse who had been recording agents outside a doughnut shop. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security claimed that he had threatened agents with a gun; videos of the shooting show him holding only his phone when he is pushed down by masked federal agents and beaten, his licensed sidearm removed from its holster by one agent before another unloads several shots into his back. Pretti’s death was a reminder—if anyone in Minnesota still needed one—that people had reason to be hiding, and that those trying to help them, protect them, or protest on their behalf had reason to be scared.

The church has a mostly Hispanic and working-class flock. Its pastor, Miguel Aviles, who goes by Pastor Miguel, told me that it had sent out about 2,000 packages of food that Saturday, and about 25,000 since the federal agents had arrived. Many of the people in hiding, he said, “have asylum cases pending. They already have work permits and stuff, but some of them are legal residents and still they’re afraid to go out. Because of their skin color, they are afraid to go out.”

Federal agents have arrested about 3,000 people in the state, but they have released the names of only about 240 of those detained, leaving unclear how many of the larger number have committed any crimes. Many more thousands of people have been affected by the arrests and the fear they have instilled. Minnesota Public Radio estimates that in school districts “with widespread federal activity, as many as 20 to 40 percent of students have been absent in recent weeks.”

I don’t know what the feds expected when they surged into Minnesota. In late November, The New York Times reported on a public-benefit fraud scheme in the state that was executed mainly by people of Somali descent. Federal prosecutors under the Biden administration had already indicted dozens of people, but after the Times story broke, President Trump began ranting about Somalis, whom he referred to as “garbage”; declared that he didn’t want Somali immigrants in the country; and announced that he was sending thousands of armed federal immigration agents to Minneapolis. This weekend, he posted on social media that the agents were there because of “massive monetary fraud.” The real reason may be that a majority of Minnesotans did not vote for him. Trump has said that “I won Minnesota three times, and I didn’t get credit for it. That’s a crooked state.” He has never won Minnesota.

Perhaps the Trump-administration officials had hoped that a few rabble-rousers would get violent, justifying the kind of crackdown he seems to fantasize about. Maybe they had assumed that they would find only a caricature of “the resistance”—people who seethed about Trump online but would be unwilling to do anything to defend themselves against him.

Instead, what they discovered in the frozen North was something different: a real resistance, broad and organized and overwhelmingly nonviolent, the kind of movement that emerges only under sustained attacks by an oppressive state. Tens of thousands of volunteers—at the very least—are risking their safety to defend their neighbors and their freedom. They aren’t looking for attention or likes on social media. Unless they are killed by federal agents, as Pretti and Renee Good were, other activists do not even necessarily know their names. Many use a handle or code name out of fear of government retaliation. Their concerns are justified: A number of people working as volunteers or observers told me that they had been trailed home by ICE agents, and some of their communications have already been infiltrated, screenshotted, and posted online, forcing them to use new text chains and code names. One urgent question among observers, as the videos of Pretti’s killing spread, was what his handle might have been.

Olsen had originally used the handle “Redbear” in communicating with me, but later said I could name him. He had agreed to let me ride along while he did his deliveries. As he loaded up his truck with supplies, he wore just a long-sleeved red shirt and vest, apparently unfazed by the Minnesota cold.

“This is my first occupation,” Olsen said as I climbed into the truck. “Welcome to the underground, I guess.”

The number of Minnesotans resisting the federal occupation is so large that relatively few could be characterized as career activists. They are ordinary Americans—people with jobs, moms and dads, friends and neighbors. They can be divided into roughly three groups.

The largest is the protesters, who show up at events such as Friday’s march in downtown Minneapolis, and at the airport, where deportation flights take off. Many protesters have faced tear gas and pepper spray, and below-zero temperatures—during the Twin Cities march on Friday, I couldn’t take notes; the ink in my pens had frozen.

Then there are the people who load up their car with food, toiletries, and school supplies from churches or schools to take to families in hiding. They also help families who cannot work meet their rent or mortgage payments. In addition to driving around with Olsen, I rode along with a Twin Cities mom of young kids named Amanda as she did deliveries (she asked me to use only her first name). Riding in her small car—her back row was taken up by three child seats and a smattering of stray toys—she told me that she’d gotten involved after more than 100 students at her kids’ elementary school simply stopped coming in. Parents got organized to provide the families with food, to shepherd their kids to school, and to arrange playdates for those stuck inside.

Amanda’s father and husband are immigrants, she said, and she speaks Spanish. “I can be a conduit between those who want to help and those who need help,” she told me. She calls each family before knocking on the door, so they don’t have to worry that they are being tricked by ICE. At one home, a woman asked us to go around back because a suspicious vehicle was idling out front. At another home, a little girl in pigtails beamed as Amanda handed her a Target bag full of school supplies.

Finally, there are those most at risk of coming into violent contact with federal agents, a group that’s come to be popularly known as ICE Watch, although the designation is unofficial—as far as I can tell, you’re in ICE Watch if you watch ICE. These are the whistle-wielding pedestrians and drivers calling themselves “observers” or “commuters” who patrol for federal agents (usually identifiable by their SUVs with out-of-state plates) and alert the neighborhood to their presence. Pretti and Good, the two Minneapolis residents killed by federal agents, fit in this category.

Trump-administration officials and MAGA influencers have repeatedly called these activists “violent” and said they are involved in “riots.” But the resistance in Minnesota is largely characterized by a conscious, strategic absence of physical confrontation. Activists have made the decision to emphasize protection, aid, and observation. When matters escalate, it is usually the choice of the federal agents. Of the three homicides in Minneapolis this year, two were committed by federal agents.

“There’s been an incredible, incredible response from the community. I’ve seen our neighbors go straight from allies to family—more than family—checking in on each other, offering food and rides for kids and all kinds of support, alerting each other if there’s ICE or any kind of danger,” Malika Dahir, a local activist of Somali descent, told me.

If the Minnesota resistance has an overarching ideology, you could call it “neighborism”—a commitment to protecting the people around you, no matter who they are or where they came from. The contrast with the philosophy guiding the Trump administration couldn’t be more extreme. Vice President Vance has said that “it is totally reasonable and acceptable for American citizens to look at their next-door neighbors and say, ‘I want to live next to people who I have something in common with. I don’t want to live next to four families of strangers.’” Minnesotans are insisting that their neighbors are their neighbors whether they were born in Minneapolis or Mogadishu. That is, arguably, a deeply Christian philosophy, one apparently loathed by some of the most powerful Christians in America.

On Wednesday, I met with two volunteers who went by the handles “Green Bean” and “Cobalt.” They picked me up in the parking lot of a Target, not far from where Good was killed two weeks earlier. Cobalt works in tech but has recently been spending more time on patrol than at her day job. Green Bean is a biologist, but she told me the grant that had been funding her work hadn’t been renewed under the Trump administration. Neither of them had imagined doing what they were doing now. “I’m supposed to be creeping around in the woods looking at insects,” Green Bean said.

Most commuters work in pairs—a co-pilot listens in on a dispatcher who provides the locations of ICE encounters and can run plates through a database of cars that federal agents have used in the past. Green Bean explained what happens when they identify an ICE vehicle. (Both ICE and Border Patrol are in Minneapolis, but everyone just calls them ICE.) The commuters will follow the agents, honking loudly, until they leave the neighborhood or stop and get out.

The commuters—as my colleague Robert Worth reported—do not have a centralized leadership but have been trained by local activist groups that have experience from past protests against police killings, and recent immigration-enforcement sweeps in L.A. and Chicago. The observers are taught to conscientiously follow the law, including traffic rules, and to try to avoid physical confrontation with federal agents.

If the agents detain someone, the observers will try to get that person’s name so they can inform the family. But ICE prefers to make arrests—which the ICE Watchers call “abductions”—quietly. More often than not, Green Bean said, when these volunteers draw attention, the agents will “leave rather than dig in.” She added, “They are huge pussies, I will be honest.”

As we cruised through the Powderhorn neighborhood, practically every business had an ICE OUT sign in the window. Graffiti trashing ICE was everywhere, as were posters of Good labeled AMERICAN MOM KILLED BY ICE. Listening to the dispatcher, Cobalt relayed directions to Green Bean about the locations of ICE vehicles, commuters who had been boxed in or threatened by agents, and possible “abductions.”

About 30 minutes into the patrol, Green Bean saw a white Jeep Wagoneer with out-of-state plates and read out the numbers. “Confirmed ICE,” Cobalt said, and we began following the Wagoneer as it drove through the neighborhood. Another car of commuters joined us, making as much noise as possible.

After about 10 minutes, the Wagoneer got onto the highway. Green Bean followed until we could be sure that it wasn’t doubling back to the neighborhood, and then we turned around.

Most encounters with ICE end like that. But sometimes situations deteriorate—as with Good, who was killed while doing a version of what Green Bean and Cobalt were now doing. The task is stressful for the observers, who understand that even minor encounters can turn deadly.

The next day, I drove around with another pair of commuters who went by “Judy” and “Lime.” Both told me they were anti-Zionist Jews who had been involved in pro-Palestinian and Black Lives Matter protests. Lime’s day job is with an abortion-rights organization, and Judy is a rabbi. “I did protective presence in the West Bank,” Lime told me, referring to a form of protest in which activists try to deter settler violence by simply being present in Palestinian communities. “This is very similar.”

About an hour into our drive, we came across an ICE truck. Judy started blaring the horn, and I heard her mutter to herself: “We’re just driving, we’re just driving, which is legal. I hate this.” I asked them both if they were scared. “I do not feel scared, but I probably should,” Lime said.

Judy said she had been out on patrol days after Good was killed, and had gotten boxed in and yelled at by federal agents. “It was very scary,” Judy told me. “Murdering someone definitely works as an intimidation tactic. You just have no idea what is going to happen.” She said that ICE agents had taken a picture of her license plate and then later showed up at her house, leaning out of their car to take another picture—making it clear to Judy that they knew who she was.

Green Bean had told me the same thing—that agents had come to her house, followed her when she left, and then blocked her vehicle and screamed at her to “stop fucking following us. This is your last warning.” Green Bean was able to laugh while retelling this. “I just stared at them until they left,” she said.

We drove past Good’s memorial. Tributes to her—flowers and letters—were still there, covered in a light powder of snow. We didn’t know at the time that residents would soon set up another memorial, for Pretti.

The broad nature of the civil resistance in Minnesota should not lead anyone to believe that no one there supports what ICE is doing. Plenty of people do. Trump came close to winning the state in 2024, and many people here, especially outside the Twin Cities, believe the administration’s rhetoric about targeting “the worst of the worst,” despite what the actual statistics reveal.

“You don’t have to go too far south” to find places where Minnesotans “welcome ICE into their restaurants and bars and sort of love what they do,” Tom Jenkins, the lead pastor of Mount Calvary Lutheran Church in suburban Eagan, which is also helping with food drives, told me. “A lot of people are still cheering ICE on because they don’t think that whatever people are telling them or showing them is real.”

Although most of the coverage has understandably focused on the cities, suburban residents told me that they had seen operations all over the state. “There are mobile homes not far from where I live,” Jenkins said. Agents “were there every day, you know: 10, 15, 20 agents working the bus stops and bus drop-offs.” He added: “They’re all over.”

Even among those involved in opposing ICE in Minnesota, people have a range of political views. The nonviolent nature of the movement, and the focus on caring for neighbors, has drawn in volunteers with many different perspectives on immigration, including people who might have been supportive if the Trump administration’s claims of a targeted effort to deport violent criminals had been sincere.

“One of the things that I believe, and I know most of the Latino community agrees, is that we want the bad people out. We want the criminals out,” Pastor Miguel, who immigrated from Mexico 30 years ago, told me. “All of us came here looking for a better life for us and for our children. So when we have criminals, rapists—when we have people who have done horrible things in our streets, in our communities—we are afraid of them. We don’t want them here.”

The problem is that federal agents are not going after just criminals. Growing distraught, Pastor Miguel said that one of the men who helped organize the food drive, a close friend of his who he believed had legal status, had been picked up by federal agents the day before I visited.

“I just—I didn’t have words,” he said. “And yet I cannot crumble; I cannot fall. Because all these families also need us.”

Two days after Pretti was killed, my colleague Nick Miroff broke the news that Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official who had led the operation in Minneapolis, would be leaving the city and replaced by Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan. Bovino, strutting around in body armor or his distinctive long coat, seemed to relish his role as a villain to his critics, encouraging aggressive tactics by federal agents and sometimes engaging in them himself. The day I accompanied Green Bean and Cobalt, Bovino fumbled with a gas canister before throwing it into a sparse crowd of protesters.

Bovino’s departure seemed an admission that Minnesotans aren’t the only Americans who won’t tolerate more deaths at the hands of federal agents. The people of Minnesota have forced the Trump administration into a strategic retreat—one inflicted not as rioters or insurgents, but as neighbors.

After Friday’s protest, when thousands marched in frigid downtown Minneapolis, chanting, “No Trump, no troops, Twin Cities ain’t licking boots!” I spoke with a young protester named Ethan McFarland, who told me that his parents are immigrants from Uganda. He had recently asked his mother to show him her immigration papers, in case she got picked up. This kind of state oppression, he said, is exactly what his mother was “trying to get away from” when she came to the United States.

McFarland’s remarks reminded me of something Stephen Miller, the Trump adviser, had written: “Migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions, and terrors, of their broken homelands.” In Minnesota, the opposite was happening. The “conditions and terrors” of immigrants’ “broken homelands” weren’t being re-created by immigrants. They were being re-created by people like Miller. The immigrants simply have the experience to recognize them.

The federal surge into Minneapolis reflects a series of mistaken MAGA assumptions. The first is the belief that diverse communities aren’t possible: “Social bonds form among people who have something in common,” Vance said in a speech last July. “If you stop importing millions of foreigners into the country, you allow social cohesion to form naturally.” Vance’s remarks are the antithesis to the neighborism of the Twin Cities, whose people do not share the narcissism of being capable of loving only those who are exactly like them.

A second MAGA assumption is that the left is insincere in its values, and that principles of inclusion and unity are superficial forms of virtue signaling. White liberals might put a sign in their front yard saying IMMIGRANTS WELCOME, but they will abandon those immigrants at the first sensation of sustained pressure.

And in Trump’s defense, this has turned out to be true of many liberals in positions of power—university administrators, attorneys at white-shoe law firms, political leaders. But it is not true of millions of ordinary Americans, who have poured into the streets in protest, spoken out against the administration, and, in Minnesota, resisted armed men in masks at the cost of their own life.

The MAGA faith in liberal weakness has been paired with the conviction that real men—Trump’s men—are conversely strong. Consider Miller’s bizarre meltdown while addressing Memphis police in October. “The gangbangers that you deal with—they think that they’re ruthless? They have no idea how ruthless we are. They think they’re tough? They have no idea how tough we are,” Miller said. “They think they’re hard-core? We are so much more hard-core than they are.” Around this time, Miller moved his family onto a military base—for safety reasons.

The federal agents sent to Minnesota wear body armor and masks, and bear long guns and sidearms. But their skittishness and brutality are qualities associated with fear, not resolve. It takes far more courage to stare down the barrel of a gun while you’re armed with only a whistle and a phone than it does to point a gun at an unarmed protester.

Every social theory undergirding Trumpism has been broken on the steel of Minnesotan resolve. The multiracial community in Minneapolis was supposed to shatter. It did not. It held until Bovino was forced out of the Twin Cities with his long coat between his legs.

The secret fear of the morally depraved is that virtue is actually common, and that they’re the ones who are alone. In Minnesota, all of the ideological cornerstones of MAGA have been proved false at once. Minnesotans, not the armed thugs of ICE and the Border Patrol, are brave. Minnesotans have shown that their community is socially cohesive—because of its diversity and not in spite of it. Minnesotans have found and loved one another in a world atomized by social media, where empty men have tried to fill their lonely soul with lies about their own inherent superiority. Minnesotans have preserved everything worthwhile about “Western civilization,” while armed brutes try to tear it down by force.

No matter how many more armed men Trump sends to impose his will on the people of Minnesota, all he can do is accentuate their valor. No application of armed violence can make the men with guns as heroic as the people who choose to stand in their path with empty hands in defense of their neighbors. These agents, and the president who sent them, are no one’s heroes, no one’s saviors—just men with guns who have to hide their faces to shoot a mom in the face, and a nurse in the back.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Tech giants face growing internal and external pressure as leadership maintains close ties with the Trump administration despite the controversial killing of a citizen by federal agents in Minneapolis. While employees and some industry figures condemn the administration's actions and lack of accountability, top CEOs remain largely silent or continue significant political backing.

        <hr/>
        Hours after Alex Pretti was killed by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy showed up for a movie night at the White House. Along with other business executives and several prominent Trump supporters, they attended a private screening of Melania, a new documentary about the president’s wife. The moviegoers were treated to buckets of popcorn and sugar cookies frosted with the first lady’s name.

Silicon Valley’s top executives have seemingly taken every opportunity to cozy up to President Trump. During his inauguration a year ago, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, Elon Musk, and Cook sat smiling behind the president in the Capitol Rotunda. The obsequiousness has not stopped since: In August, Cook presented Trump with a custom plaque atop a 24-karat-gold base in the Oval Office. At a White House dinner the next month, the Google co-founder Sergey Brin praised Trump’s “civil rights” work, and OpenAI’s Sam Altman described Trump’s leadership as a “refreshing change.” Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Google are among the companies that have made donations to fund the new White House ballroom.

Tech has a long history of making moves to appease politicians in power, including ample campaign donations. But the industry’s leaders have not distanced themselves from Trump even as his administration has shattered constitutional and democratic norms. In Minneapolis over the weekend, an American citizen was shot in the street by masked federal officers after recording them with his phone. In the immediate aftermath, top Trump-administration officials blamed Pretti for his own death, despite contradictory video evidence. The uproar has been loud, and not just among Democrats. So far, Silicon Valley’s top CEOs have largely remained silent.

In some ways, tech’s rightward shift in 2024 was overstated. The embrace of Trump was mostly concentrated among a small pack of investors and executives, who had a quieting effect on the rest of the industry. In the past few days, the gulf between the top brass and the rank and file has grown. Hundreds of employees from major companies including Apple, Amazon, OpenAI, and beyond have signed a statement asking the industry’s CEOs to call the White House and comment publicly against the violence. Several well-respected voices in the industry have spoken up: “Every person regardless of political affiliation should be denouncing this,” Google’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, posted on X after the shooting. “The video was sickening to watch,” wrote the investor Vinod Khosla, who called out the administration’s “storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts.” Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, one of the few major Silicon Valley CEOs to have expressed his condemnation, took the opportunity to warn against the “reluctance of tech companies to criticize the US government.”

Altman reportedly rebuked the administration in an internal post to OpenAI employees, writing that “what’s happening with ICE is going too far.” He added that the president is “a very strong leader” who he hopes “will rise to this moment and unite the country.”

Yet there is little reason to believe that Silicon Valley’s uppermost ranks will more formally break with Trump. If anything, as the midterm elections approach, some executives appear to be doubling down on their support. This fall, Greg Brockman, the president of OpenAI, and his wife, Anna, donated $25 million to Trump’s super PAC. And Elon Musk recently signaled his political return with a $10 million donation to the pro-Trump candidate running to succeed Mitch McConnell—the Tesla CEO’s largest-ever single contribution to a Senate candidate. (Jassy, Cook, and Greg Brockman did not respond to requests for comment. OpenAI, which has a corporate partnership with The Atlantic, has previously said that the Brockmans’ donations were made in a personal capacity.)

During Trump’s first term in office, a number of these tech leaders were outspoken in criticizing him: In 2017, Brin showed up to a protest against Trump’s Muslim ban, and Altman spoke with 100 Trump voters across the country to figure out what it would take to “convince them not to vote for him in the future.” Greg Brockman previously donated to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. It’s conceivable that these leaders’ political views changed, of course, but the groveling reads obviously as strategy. Trump is a dealmaker, and playing to his administration is good for business. Already, tech companies have gained a lot by cozying up to Trump, including relaxed AI regulation and tariff exemptions.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Anthropic, a leading AI firm valued at $183 billion, faces an internal struggle between maintaining its ethical stance as a safety-focused 'superego' and the competitive pressure to develop powerful technology. While the company has avoided public scandals and focuses on vetting its models like Claude, it simultaneously publishes research on the risks of its own creations, highlighting the tension between its commercial growth and existential concerns.

        Updated at 4:44 p.m. ET on January 28, 2026

These are not the words you want to hear when it comes to human extinction, but I was hearing them: “Things are moving uncomfortably fast.” I was sitting in a conference room with Sam Bowman, a safety researcher at Anthropic. Worth $183 billion at the latest estimate, the AI firm has every incentive to speed things up, ship more products, and develop more advanced chatbots to stay competitive with the likes of OpenAI, Google, and the industry’s other giants. But Anthropic is at odds with itself—thinking deeply, even anxiously, about seemingly every decision.

Anthropic has positioned itself as the AI industry’s superego: the firm that speaks with the most authority about the big questions surrounding the technology, while rival companies develop advertisements and affiliate shopping links (a difference that Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, was eager to call out during an interview in Davos last week). On Monday, Amodei published a lengthy essay, “The Adolescence of Technology,” about the “civilizational concerns” posed by what he calls “powerful AI”—the very technology his firm is developing. The essay has a particular focus on democracy, national security, and the economy. “Given the horror we’re seeing in Minnesota, its emphasis on the importance of preserving democratic values and rights at home is particularly relevant,” Amodei posted on X, making him one of very few tech leaders to make a public statement against the Trump administration’s recent actions.

This rhetoric, of course, serves as good branding—a way for Anthropic to stand out in a competitive industry. But having spent a long time following the company and, recently, speaking with many of its employees and executives, including Amodei, I can say that Anthropic is at least consistent. It messages about the ethical issues surrounding AI constantly, and it appears unusually focused on user safety. Bowman’s job, for example, is to vet Anthropic’s products before they’re released into the world, making sure that they will not spew, say, white-supremacist talking points; push users into delusional crises; or generate nonconsensual porn.

So far, the effort seems to be working: Unlike other popular chatbots, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Elon Musk’s Grok, Anthropic’s bot, Claude, has not had any major public blowups despite being as advanced as, and by some measures more advanced than, the rest of the field. (That may be in part because its chatbot does not generate images and has a smaller user base than some rival products.) But although Anthropic has so far dodged the various scandals that have plagued other large language models, the company has not inspired much faith that such problems will be avoided forever. When I met Bowman last summer, the company had recently divulged that, in experimental settings, versions of Claude had demonstrated the ability to blackmail users and assist them when they ask about making bioweapons. But the company has pushed its models onward anyway, and now says that Claude writes a good chunk—and in some instances all—of its own code.

Anthropic publishes white papers about the terrifying things it has made Claude capable of (“How LLMs Could Be Insider Threats,” “From Shortcuts to Sabotage”), and raises these issues to politicians. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and other AI executives also have long spoken in broad, aggrandizing terms about AI’s destructive potential, often to their own benefit. But those competitors have released junky TikTok clones and slop generators. Today, Anthropic’s only major consumer product other than its chatbot is Claude Code, a powerful tool that promises to automate all kinds of work, but is nonetheless targeted to a relatively small audience of developers and coders.

The company’s discretion has resulted in a corporate culture that doesn’t always make much sense. Anthropic comes across as more sincerely committed to safety than its competitors, but it is also moving full speed toward building tools that it acknowledges could be horrifically dangerous. The firm seems eager for a chance to stand out. But what does Anthropic really stand for?

Founded in 2021 by seven people who splintered off from OpenAI, Anthropic is full of staff and executives who come across as deeply, almost pathologically earnest. I sat in on a meeting of Anthropic’s Societal Impacts team, a small group dedicated to studying how AI affects work, education, and more. This was a brainstorming session: The team wanted to see if it could develop AI models that work better with people than alone, which, the group reasoned, could help prevent or slow job loss. A researcher spoke up. He pressed the team to consider that, in the very near future, AI models might just be better than humans at everything. “Basically, we’re cooked,” he said. In which case, this meeting was nothing more than a “lovely thought exercise.” The group agreed this was possible. Then it moved on.

The researcher referred to his brief, existential interruption as “classic Anthropic.” Hyperrational thought experiments, forceful debates on whether AI could be shaped for the better, an unshakable belief in technological progress—these are classic Anthropic qualities. They trickle down from the top. A few weeks after the Societal Impacts meeting, I wanted to see what Amodei himself thought about all of this. If Altman is the AI boom’s great salesman and Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind and a Nobel laureate, its scientist, then Amodei is the closest the industry has to a philosopher. He is also responsible for some of the technical research that made ChatGPT possible. “Whenever I say ‘AI,’ people think about the thing they’re using today,” Amodei told me, hands clasped and perched atop his head. “That’s almost never where my mind is. My mind is almost always at: We’re releasing a new version every three months. Where are we gonna be eight versions from now? In two years?”

When he was at OpenAI, Amodei wrote an internal document called “The Big Blob of Compute.” It laid out his belief that AI models improve as a function of the resources put into them. More power, more data, more chips, better AI. That belief now animates the entire industry. Such unwavering faith in AI progress is perhaps Anthropic’s defining feature. The company has hired a “model welfare” researcher to study whether Claude can experience suffering or is conscious. The firm has set up a miniature, AI-run vending machine in the firm’s cafeteria to study whether the technology could autonomously operate a small business selling snacks and trinkets. Claude selects inventory, sets prices, and requests refills, while humans just restock the shelves. Welcome to the singularity.

Amodei and the rest of the group founded Anthropic partly because of disagreements over how to prepare the world for AI. Amodei is especially worried about job displacement, telling me that AI could erase a large portion of white-collar jobs within five years; he dedicated an entire section of “The Adolescence of Technology” to the danger that the AI boom might accumulate tremendous wealth primarily to firms such as his own.

Even with this and other gloomy forecasts of his, Amodei has bristled at the notion that he and his firm are “doomers”—that their primary motivation is preventing AI from wiping out a large number of jobs or lives. “I tend to be fairly optimistic,” he told me. In addition to “The Adolescence of Technology,” Amodei has published a 14,000-word manifesto called “Machines of Loving Grace” that comprehensively details a utopian vision for his technology: eliminating almost all disease, lifting billions out of poverty, doubling human lifespan. There is not a hint of irony; the essay envisions people being “literally moved to tears” by the majesty of AI’s accomplishments. Amodei’s employees cited it to me in conversation numerous times. Meanwhile, Altman trolls on X, and Musk seems to exist in a continuum of AI slop and conspiracy theories.

When Anthropic launched Claude, in 2023, the bot’s distinguishing feature was a “Constitution” that the model was trained on detailing how it should behave; last week, Anthropic revamped the document into a 22,000-word treatise on how to make Claude a moral and sincere actor. Claude, the constitution’s authors write, has the ability to foster emotional dependence, design bioweapons, and manipulate its users, so it’s Anthropic’s responsibility to instill upright character in Claude to avoid these outcomes. “Once we decide to create Claude, even inaction is a kind of action,” they write. No other firm had, or has, any truly comparable document.

Amodei says he wants rival companies to act in ways he believes are more responsible. Several of Anthropic’s major AI-safety initiatives and research advances have indeed been adopted by top competitors, such as its approach to preventing the use of AI to build bioweapons. And OpenAI has shared a “Model Spec,” its far more streamlined and pragmatic answer to Anthropic’s constitution—which contains no talk of ChatGPT’s “character” or “preserving important societal structures.” (OpenAI has a corporate partnership with The Atlantic.)

All of this helps Anthropic’s bottom line, of course: The emphasis on responsibility is “very attractive to large enterprise businesses which are also quite safety-, brand-conscious,” Daniela Amodei, Anthropic’s president (and Dario’s sister), told me from a sweaty conference room in Anthropic’s old headquarters in 2024. Nearly two years later, Anthropic controls 40 percent of the enterprise-AI market. The Amodeis hope their commercial success will pressure competitors to more aggressively prioritize safety as well.

That said, it’s not always clear that these efforts to spark a “race to the top”—another phrase of Amodei’s that his employees invoke constantly—have been successful. Anthropic’s research established AI sycophancy as an issue well before “AI psychosis” emerged, yet AI psychosis still became something that many people apparently suffer from. Amodei recognizes that his own products aren’t perfect, either. “I absolutely do not want to warrant and guarantee that we will never have these problems,” he said. Several independent AI researchers, including some who have partnered with Anthropic to test Claude for various risks, told me that although Anthropic appears more committed to AI safety than its competitors, that’s a low bar.

Anthropic’s mode is generally to publish information about AI models and wait for the world to make the hard calls about how to control or regulate them. The main regulatory proposal of Jack Clark, a co-founder of Anthropic and its head of policy, is that governments establish “transparency” requirements, or some sort of mandated reporting about what internal tests reveal about AI products. But the company is particular about what it deems worth publishing. The firm does not, for instance, share much about its AI-training data or carbon footprint. When I asked Clark about how much information remains hidden—particularly in terms of how Anthropic’s AI tools are actually developed—he argued that transparency into how AI models are produced isn’t all that important. (Some of that information is also, presumably, proprietary.) Rather, Clark told me, the outcomes of the technology are what matter.

There is a “well-established norm that whatever goes on inside a factory is by and large left up to the innovator that’s built that factory, but you care a lot about what comes out of the factory,” he said, explaining why he believes that AI companies sharing information about how their products are made matters less than reporting what they can do. Typically the government “reaches inside” the factory, he said, only when something in the output—say, heavy metals—raises cause for concern. Never mind the long history of regulation dictating what goes on inside factories—emergency exits in clothing factories, cleanliness standards in meatpacking facilities, and so on. (Clark did note that laws sometimes need to change, and that they haven’t yet adapted to AI.)

He brought up Wall Street, of all examples, to make his point. Lawmakers “thought they had transparency into financial systems,” he said—that banks and hedge funds and so on were giving reliable reports on their dealings. “Then the financial crash happened,” regulators realized that transparency was inadequate and gameable, and Congress changed the law. (President Trump then changed much of it back.) In the long run, Clark seemed to feel, this was the system working as it should. But his comparison also raises the possibility that before anybody can figure out how to get the AI boom right, something must go horribly wrong.

In mid-September, Anthropic cybersecurity experts detected unusual activity among a group of Claude users. They came to suspect that it was a major, AI-enabled Chinese cyberespionage campaign—an attempt by foreign actors to use Claude to automate the theft of sensitive information. Anthropic promptly shut the operation down, published a report, and sent Logan Graham, who heads a team at the company that evaluates advanced uses of AI, to explain the situation to Congress.

In theory, this sequence represented Anthropic’s philosophy at work: Detect risks posed by AI and warn the public. But the incident also underscored how unpredictable, and uncontrollable, the environment really is. Months before the Chinese hack, Graham told me that he felt “pretty good” about the precautions the company had taken around cyberthreats.

Nobody can foresee all of the ways any AI product might be used, for good or ill, but that’s exactly why Anthropic’s sanctimony can seem silly. For all Amodei’s warnings about the possible harms of automation, Anthropic’s bots themselves are among the products that may take away jobs; many consider Claude the best AI at coding, for instance. After one of my visits to Anthropic’s offices, I went to an event for software engineers a few blocks away at which founders gave talks about products developed with Anthropic software. Someone demonstrated a tool that could automate outreach for job recruitment—leading one attendee to exclaim, with apparent glee, “This is going to destroy an entire industry!”

When I asked several Anthropic employees if they’d want to slow down the AI boom in an ideal world, none seemed to have ever seriously considered the question; it was too far-fetched a possibility, even for them. Joshua Batson, an interpretability researcher at Anthropic—he studies the labyrinthine inner workings of AI models—told me that it would be nice if the industry could go half as fast. Jared Kaplan, a co-founder of Anthropic and the firm’s chief science officer, told me he’d prefer it if AGI, or artificial general intelligence, arrived in 2032 rather than, say, 2028; Bowman, the safety researcher, said he thought slowing down for just a couple of months might be enough. Everyone seemed to believe, though, that AI-safety research itself could eventually be automated with Claude—and once that happens, they reasoned, their tests could keep up with the AI’s exponentially improving capabilities.

Like so many others in the industry, the employees I spoke with also contended that neither Anthropic nor any other AI company could actually slow development down. “The world gets to make this decision, not companies,” Clark told me, seated cross-legged on his chair, and “the system of capital markets says, Go faster.” So they are. Anthropic is reportedly fundraising at a $350 billion valuation, and its advertisements litter Instagram and big-city billboards. This month, the company launched a version of its Claude Code product geared toward non-software engineers called Claude Cowork. And in July, as first reported in Wired, Amodei wrote an internal memo to employees that Anthropic would seek investments from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, which, in his words, would likely enrich “dictators.” Warnings about the dangers of authoritarian AI have been central in Anthropic’s public messaging; “Machines of Loving Grace” includes dire descriptions of the threat of “authoritarian” AI.

When I brought this up to Amodei, he cut me off. “We never made a commitment not to seek funding from the Middle East,” he said. “One of the traps you can fall into when you’re doing a good job running a responsible company is every decision that you make” can be “interpreted as a moral commitment.” There was no “pressing need” to seek Middle Eastern funding before, and doing so entailed “complexities,” he said. I took his implication to be that the intensive capital demands of the AI race now made such investments a necessity. Still, such investors, Amodei said, wouldn’t have any control over his firm. A few days after we spoke, Anthropic announced the Qatar Investment Authority as a “significant” investor in a new fundraising round.

If you zoom out enough, and perhaps not even all that far, Anthropic stands for the same things that OpenAI, Google, Meta, and anyone else in the AI race do: to build fantastically powerful chatbots and use them to transform the world and beat the competition. Across the company, the belief in AI’s potential is messianic. AI “presents one of the only technologies” that gets us out of the challenges ahead for humanity, Clark told me: climate change, aging populations, resource contention, authoritarianism, war. Without AI, he said, there will be more and more “Mad Max–like swaths of the world.”

Trenton Bricken, who works on AI safety at Anthropic, took this notion to an even greater extreme: He would ideally want the AI industry to slow down, but “every year that we stall, there are lots of people suffering who otherwise would not,” he told me, referring to the possibility that AI will eventually cure diseases and achieve everything else outlined in “Machines of Loving Grace.” His colleague Sholto Douglas claimed that such a delay “comes at the cost of millions of lives.”

Perhaps the greatest confusion at Anthropic is between theory and practice—the idea of safe AI versus the speed necessary to win the AI race. A corporate culture built around deep thought experiments and genuine disagreements about the future also has to sell AI. In the company’s view, these ends are complementary; better for it to responsibly usher in the AI future than Elon Musk or China. But that’s also a convenient way to justify an any-means-necessary approach to progress. I thought of that automated vending machine that the company had set up in its office. Claude ran the business into the ground in only a month through a string of very poor pricing and stocking decisions. But none of those really mattered: Anthropic had placed the machine next to all the free snacks in the office canteen.

When I asked Amodei recently about how he could justify the breakneck pace given the concerns he has over safety, he expressed total confidence in his staff—and also floated a new idea. Perhaps, he suggested, Claude will become so intelligent in the very near future that the bot will enable something radical: “Maybe at some point in 2027, what we want to do is just slow things down,” he said, and let the models fix themselves. “For just a few months.”

        <hr/>
        When I first saw the video of the killing of Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital, I immediately thought of the parable of the Good Samaritan. Federal agents shot Pretti after he tried to help a woman they had thrown to the ground and pepper-sprayed. Jesus tells us to love our neighbors as ourselves and help those in need. “Do this and you will live,” he says. Not in Donald Trump’s America.

Americans have now seen with their own eyes the cost of President Trump’s abuse of power and disregard for the Constitution. Videos of the killing of Pretti and Renee Good by federal agents have exposed the lies of Trump-administration officials who were quick to smear the victims as “domestic terrorists.” Even Americans who have grown habituated to Trump’s excesses have been shaken by these killings and the reflexively cruel and dishonest response from the administration.

This crisis also reveals a deeper moral rot at the heart of Trump’s MAGA movement. Whatever you think about immigration policy, how can a person of conscience justify the lack of compassion and empathy for the victims in Minnesota, and for the families torn apart or hiding in fear, for the children separated from their parents or afraid to go to school?

That compassion is weak and cruelty is strong has become an article of MAGA faith. Trump and his allies believe that the more inhumane the treatment, the more likely it is to spread fear. That’s the goal of surging heavily armed federal forces into blue states such as Minnesota and Maine—street theater of the most dangerous kind. Other recent presidents, including Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, managed to deport millions of undocumented immigrants without turning American cities into battlegrounds or making a show of keeping children in cages.

“The cruelty is the point,” as The Atlantic’s Adam Serwer memorably put it during Trump’s first term. The savagery is a feature, not a bug. By contrast, as Serwer noted recently in these pages, the people of Minnesota have responded with an approach you could call “‘neighborism’—a commitment to protecting the people around you, no matter who they are or where they came from.” To my ears, that’s as Christian a value as it gets.

The glorification of cruelty and rejection of compassion don’t just shape the Trump administration’s policies. Those values are also at the core of Trump’s own character and worldview. And they have become a rallying cry for a cadre of hard-right “Christian influencers” who are waging a war on empathy.

Their twisted campaign validates Trump’s personal immorality and his administration’s cruelty. It marginalizes mainstream religious leaders who espouse traditional values that conflict with Trump’s behavior and agenda. And it threatens to pave the way for an extreme vision of Christian nationalism that seeks to replace democracy with theocracy in America.

The rejection of bedrock Christian values such as dignity, mercy, and compassion did not start with the crisis in Minnesota. The tone was set right at the beginning of this second Trump presidency. The day after taking the oath of office last January, Trump attended a prayer service at the National Cathedral. The Episcopal bishop of Washington, Mariann Edgar Budde, directed part of her sermon at the new president: “In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now.” She spoke of children of immigrant families afraid that their parents would be taken away, refugees fleeing persecution, and young LGBTQ Americans who feared for their lives. It was an honest plea, suffused with the kind of love and generosity toward neighbors and strangers that Jesus taught.

Bishop Budde was immediately vilified. One Republican congressman said she “should be added to the deportation list.” The pastor and influencer Ben Garrett warned his followers, “This snake is God’s enemy and yours too. She hates God and His people. You need to properly hate in response.” The right-wing Christian podcaster Allie Beth Stuckey called the sermon “toxic empathy that is in complete opposition to God’s Word and in support of the most satanic, destructive ideas ever conjured up.” Toxic empathy! What an oxymoron. I don’t know if the phrase reflects moral blindness or moral bankruptcy, but either way it’s appalling.

This is certainly not what I was taught in Sunday school, not what my reading of the Bible teaches me, and not what I believe Jesus preached in his short time on Earth. Yes, I went to Sunday school. In fact, my mother taught Sunday school at our Methodist church in Park Ridge, Illinois. As an adult, I occasionally taught at our church in Little Rock, Arkansas. Some people—such as the Republican congressman who once called me the Antichrist—might find this surprising. (When I confronted him, he mumbled something about not having meant it. Trump later appointed him to his Cabinet.)

I’ve never been one to wear my faith on my sleeve, but that doesn’t mean it’s not important to me. Quite the opposite: My faith has sustained me, informed me, saved me, chided me, and challenged me. I don’t know who I would be or where I would have ended up without it. So I am not a disinterested observer here. I believe that Christians like me—and people of faith more generally—have a responsibility to stand up to the extremists who use religion to divide our society and undermine our democracy.

No less a religious authority than the late Pope Francis called out the Trump administration’s war on empathy. After Vice President Vance argued that Christians should be stingy with their love, prioritizing those close to us over strangers, he offered a rebuke. “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups,” the pope noted, before urging everyone to read up on the Good Samaritan.

The contrast between traditional Christian morality and Trumpian amorality was particularly stark at the memorial service for the slain MAGA activist Charlie Kirk in September. Kirk’s widow, Erika, publicly forgave her husband’s killer. “I forgive him because it was what Christ did,” she said. “The answer to hate is not hate. The answer we know from the Gospel is love and always love.”

It reminded me of the families of the victims of the Mother Emanuel Church massacre in Charleston, South Carolina. In 2015, nine Black worshippers were murdered at an evening Bible study by a young white man trying to start a race war. In court a few days later, one by one, grieving parents and siblings stood up and told the shooter, “I forgive you.”

Instead of being inspired by Erika Kirk’s grace, though, Trump rejected it. “I hate my opponent and I don’t want the best for them,” he declared. He would not forgive his enemies. “I am sorry, Erika,” he said. So much for “Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute you.”

With leadership like this, it’s no wonder that one survey found a quarter of Republicans and nearly 40 percent of Christian nationalists now agree that “empathy is a dangerous emotion that undermines our ability to set up a society that is guided by God’s truth.” MAGA rejects the teachings of Jesus to “love thy neighbor” and care for “the last, the least, and the lost.” It recognizes only a zero-sum war of all against all. The world may look gilded from the patio at Mar-a-Lago, but the MAGA view is fundamentally fearful and impoverished. MAGA sees a world of vengeance, scorn, and humiliation, and cannot imagine generosity or solidarity.

The whole exercise is suffused with barely disguised misogyny. The extremist pastor Joe Rigney wrote a book called Leadership and the Sin of Empathy. Rigney is an ally of the influential Christian nationalist Douglas Wilson, who thinks giving women the right to vote was a mistake and advocates turning the United States into a theocracy. (Would it shock you to know that Pete Hegseth is a big fan of Wilson’s?)

Rigney declared that Bishop Budde’s plea for mercy was “a reminder that feminism is a cancer that enables the politics of empathetic manipulation and victimhood that has plagued us in the era of wokeness.” Manipulation by wily women is a sexist trope as old as Adam and Eve, but this is an ugly new twist. Instead of women tempting men with vice, now the great fear is that women will tempt men with virtue.

Christian nationalism—the belief that God has called certain Christians to exercise dominion over every aspect of American life, with no separation between Church and state—is ascendant in Trump’s Washington. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, displays a historic flag outside his office on Capitol Hill that in recent years has been embraced by Christian nationalists. The same flag was carried by insurrectionists on January 6, 2021, and flown by Justice Samuel Alito’s wife at the couple’s vacation home.

The National Council of Churches, the largest ecumenical organization for mainline churches in the country, has warned about the dangers of Christian nationalism. “In this quest for political power, Christian humility is lost, as is the message of God’s love for all humanity,” the council said in a 2021 statement. “Where the Bible has at its core the story of a people committed to welcoming aliens and strangers because they themselves were aliens and strangers, and to defending the oppressed because they themselves were once oppressed, the Christian nationalist narrative rejects the stranger and judges the oppressed as deserving of their oppression.”

This is exactly the kind of mainstream Christian view that enrages Allie Beth Stuckey. The author of Toxic Empathy, who styles herself a voice for Christian women, has more than a million followers on social media. In between lifestyle pitter-patter and her demonization of IVF treatments, she warns women not to listen to their soft hearts. This commissar of MAGA morality targets other evangelicals whose empathy, she warns, has left them open to manipulation. Maybe they recognize the humanity of an undocumented immigrant family and decide that mass deportation has gone too far. Or they make space in their heart for a young rape survivor forced to carry a pregnancy to term and start questioning the wisdom and morality of total abortion bans. It’s all toxic to Stuckey.

The don’t-love-thy-neighbor Christians have powerful allies in the war on empathy. Silicon Valley techno-authoritarians and social Darwinists argue that empathy is weakness and “suicidal” for civilization because it gets in the way of ruthless ambition and efficiency. That’s pretty rich for the crew that’s busy building artificial-intelligence systems they freely admit might obliterate humanity one day. But these are the same billionaires who dismiss critics and liberals as “NPCs,” or non-player characters, a video-game term for nonhumans. Once you see people that way, why would you care about understanding or helping them?

They may be convinced that they’re the smartest guys in the room, but they’re dead wrong about this. Empathy won’t destroy civilization; indeed, it just might save it. We can debate policies. We can debate theology. But if we give up on empathy, we give up on any real chance of coming together to solve our problems. Empathy does not overwhelm our critical thinking or blind us to moral clarity. It opens our eyes to moral complexity. It’s not a sign of weakness; it’s a source of strength.

This might be lost on tycoons who have a huge financial interest in leaving the rest of us behind on their way to Mars, but one might hope Christians would know better. You don’t need to look too far back to find examples of those who do. I disagreed with President George W. Bush about many things, but I respected his sincere belief in a more “compassionate conservatism.” There was no greater proof of this commitment than the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, a mission of mercy that helped save an estimated 26 million lives. It was a public-health miracle. Many of the program’s most ardent champions were evangelical Christians inspired by Jesus’s teachings to heal the sick and feed the hungry. That hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from slashing PEPFAR and other lifesaving assistance to people in need around the world. Experts predict that 14 million people could die by 2030 as a result—including millions of children.

Some earlier leaders of the religious right were also cruel and demagogic. When I was coming up in politics, we had huckster televangelists instead of social-media snake-oil salesmen, but the game was the same: exploit religion to profiteer and push an extreme political agenda. In the 1980s, right-wing firebrands such as Jerry Falwell and Anita Bryant claimed that the AIDS epidemic was a plague sent by God to punish gay people. There was no shortage of rhetoric that I would call dehumanizing or un-Christian. These reactionary religious forces led a decades-long campaign against women’s rights and gay rights that helped turn the Republican Party against democracy itself. The rise of unabashed Christian nationalists is their legacy.

But what we’re seeing today feels different—and more dangerous. The question of who deserves empathy, and the rights and respect that flow from our shared humanity, has always been highly contested in our politics. But until now, no major American political movement has ever seriously suggested that empathy and compassion themselves are suspect.

The decline of mainstream Christian voices in recent decades left a vacuum that the most extreme ideologues and provocateurs eagerly filled. The Catholic Church and the old mainline Protestant denominations have been weakened by destabilizing scandals and schisms, and have seen declining attendance. With the percentage of Americans identifying as Christian hitting record lows, the National Council of Churches expects that as many as 100,000 churches across the country will close in the coming years, mostly mainstream Methodist, Presbyterian, and Lutheran congregations.

It has pained me to see my own United Methodist Church split by deep disagreements over gay rights. Many conservative American congregations seceded and joined with traditionalist congregations in Africa and elsewhere to form a separate, less inclusive Church. Other denominations have faced similar struggles. All of this has left room for upstarts such as Douglas Wilson’s Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches, a growing network of more than 150 Christian-nationalist congregations.

Another factor is Trump himself. No one mistakes him for a devout Christian or a person of faith or morality. But his corruption isn’t just a personal matter—it taints everything he touches, including his Christian supporters. The conventional wisdom is that Trump says out loud what many others think privately, that his blunt bigotry gives permission for people to throw off the shackles of political correctness and woke piety. That may be partly true. He does bring out the worst in people. But it’s more than that. He makes people worse. Cruelty and ugliness are infectious. When they become the norm, we all suffer.

Consider the contrast between Trump and Reagan, two presidents beloved by the religious right. Reagan offered a vision of an optimistic, sunny, welcoming America. He called it a shining city on a hill. His policies often failed to match his rhetoric, but the stories we tell ourselves matter. They shape our national narrative and shared moral framework. By contrast, Trump’s story is dark and angry, filled with “American carnage” in the streets. It makes sense that his political movement—and its version of Christianity—would be dark and angry, too.

Reagan cultivated a distinctly American mythos: the aw-shucks cowboy working his ranch and standing up to tyranny. Trump, especially in this second term, has styled himself as a gold-plated Caesar, the farthest thing from an American ideal. Instead of the decency of Washington we get the decadence of Caligula; rather than the humility of Lincoln, the cruelty of Nero. You’d think good Christians would see the irony of throwing their lot in with a wannabe Roman emperor, but the whole point of a cult of personality is to leave you blind and afraid.

Finally, I am convinced that the uniquely pernicious dynamics of social media have put all of these trends on steroids. Our addiction to algorithms has made society more lonely, anxious, and mean. Platforms like TikTok and Elon Musk’s X reward extremism and marginalize moderation. They promote negativity and smother positivity. Empathy doesn’t drive engagement, so it’s not valuable.

In the 1980s, I was impressed by Neil Postman’s book Amusing Ourselves to Death, which argued that television was corroding American society and democracy. He bemoaned how religion and politics had been reduced to shallow entertainment as a distracted public lost the ability to think clearly and debate rationally.

Today I find Postman’s warnings eerily prescient. He argued that “each medium, like language itself, makes possible a unique mode of discourse by providing a new orientation for thought, for expression, for sensibility.” Now that social media—and short-form, algorithmic video in particular—has taken over the world, it’s crucial that we understand how this medium is shaping our culture. It’s no coincidence that TikTok has given such a boost to far-right politics. It’s not just the hidden hand of the Chinese Communist Party, or the group of Trump supporters who recently bought the app’s American shell, although that’s also alarming. It’s that the medium is designed to boost vitriol and knee-jerk reactions rather than thoughtful dialogue. It provides fertile ground for misinformation and is inhospitable to serious journalism or debate.

Cultural critics have begun warning that we are at risk of becoming a “post-literate” society. They point to declining reading and math scores across the Western world in the years since the smartphone was introduced. The fear is that with fewer people reading books and newspapers, we’ll lose the ability to process complex ideas and arguments, become more susceptible to propaganda, and, to paraphrase Postman, scroll our way to oblivion.

There’s good reason to believe that a post-literate society will also be a post-moral society. We already have Christian influencers saying empathy is a sin. We have a president who is allergic to civic virtue. Americans spend countless hours on social media and are lonelier, angrier, and more distrustful than at any time I can remember.

What can we do?

A good place to start is to follow the example of courageous faith leaders standing up to the Trump administration’s abuses. On January 23, about 100 clergy were arrested after protesting deportation flights at the Minneapolis airport. They prayed and sang hymns in the brutal cold until police took them away. Many more have fanned out across the city to support protesters and help immigrant families in need.

In November, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops released an unusual special message condemning “the indiscriminate mass deportation of people” and “the vilification of immigrants.” It is rare for America’s bishops to speak with one voice like this—the last time was in 2013—but they said, “We feel compelled now in this environment to raise our voices in defense of God-given human dignity.”

I hope grassroots faith leaders across the country who are appalled by what they see from an immoral administration and an extremist political right also find their voice. It is understandable that some stay silent out of fear. Influencers like Stuckey are zealously policing any deviation from the party line. But speaking truth to power has been part of the Christian tradition since the very beginning. The Christian community—and the country—would be stronger and healthier if we heard these voices.

We also need to contest this ground politically. If MAGA Republicans are going to give up on traditional virtues such as compassion and community, Democrats have an opportunity to fill that gap. The violent overreach in Minnesota may provide an opening to engage new audiences looking for alternatives. Many evangelical Christians who have long voted Republican are turned off by Trump’s venality and cruelty. Even some Republican leaders are starting to question the administration’s berserk immigration crackdown.

Democrats need a big tent that welcomes people of faith into our coalition, even if we don’t agree on every issue. Don’t forget, liberal Christianity has a long and storied history. Progressive people of faith have led virtually every major social movement. Think of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. marching with Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel in Selma. That’s a spirit we should work to reclaim.

Indeed, welcoming is not enough. Democrats should actively reach out to people of faith and try to win their trust and their votes. That dozens of liberal clergy have already signed up to run for office in the 2026 midterms is an encouraging sign. This doesn’t mean Democrats should abandon our commitments to freedom, justice, and equality for all, or fight any less hard for what we believe in. We should listen with an open heart and an open mind, and be unafraid to talk about our values.

I know empathy isn’t easy. But neither is Christianity. When Jesus called on us to turn the other cheek and pray for those who persecute us, it was supposed to be hard. We fail more than we succeed—we’re human—but the discipline is to keep trying.

It’s especially challenging to feel empathetic for people with whom we disagree passionately. I certainly struggle with this. You may remember that I once described half of Trump supporters as “the basket of deplorables.” I was talking about people drawn to racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia—you name it. “Some of those folks, they are irredeemable,” I said. I still believe intolerance and hatred are deplorable. Slandering a peaceful protester and cheering his murder is deplorable. Terrorizing children because their parents are undocumented is deplorable. But as a Christian, I also aspire to see the goodness in everyone and believe that everyone has a chance at redemption, no matter how remote.

When I see brutality like we’ve all witnessed in Minnesota, I ask myself: Can I really find empathy for people who insist on dehumanizing others? I’m not sure, to be honest. I’m still working on it. I believe our hearts are big enough to hold two truths at once. We can see the humanity in even the worst of our fellow human beings and still fiercely resist tyranny and repression. We can stand firm without mirroring the cruelty of our opponents. These are dark days in America. To rekindle our light, we must reject cruelty and corruption. To be strong, we need more empathy, not less.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Tesla is discontinuing the Model S, the landmark vehicle that revolutionized the electric vehicle industry and transformed cars into software-driven gadgets. This move reflects Elon Musk's strategic pivot to transition Tesla from an automaker into an AI company focused on autonomous technologies and the Optimus human robot.

        <hr/>
        Before Elon Musk, most electric vehicles seemed less like an alternative to gasoline than an argument in its favor. The sad state of affairs for EVs for many years was that they were slow, impractical, and largely enticing only if you lived with copious guilt over your carbon emissions.

Then Tesla came out with the Tesla Model S. The speedy, high-tech sedan didn’t just leave other EVs in the dust; it could compete with the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz. “EVs went from ‘eating your vegetables’ to getting you super-car performance in a vehicle that’s luxurious and quiet,” Jake Fisher, the senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, told me. The Model S proved something that’s now easy to take for granted: EVs can work, and ordinary people might actually want one. A year after the Model S’s 2012 debut, Musk personally drove one coast-to-coast to prove that it was just as capable as a gas car.

Now the Model S is going away. During Tesla’s earnings call yesterday, Musk announced that his company will soon stop manufacturing the car that launched his empire. “That is slightly sad,” he acknowledged on the call. In a sense, it was inevitable. Tech products get killed off all the time to make way for something better; Apple no longer sells the iPhone 4. Indeed, the Tesla Model S has become irrelevant and overpriced compared with the company’s newer cars. (As a Road & Track headline put it in 2023, “The Tesla Model S Has Lived Long Enough to See Itself Become a Villain.”) Nearly all of Tesla’s global sales come from the more affordable Model Y and Model 3, leaving the original Model S unceremoniously lumped in with “Other Models” in the company’s financial reports.

But Tesla is not phasing out the Model S to focus on making even better cars. The move is part of a retreat from the car business. Tesla will stop producing the Model S and another one of its less popular cars, the gull-winged Model X SUV, in order to free up space at its California factory to build the human robot Optimus. “It is time to bring the S and X programs to an end and shift to an autonomous future,” Musk said yesterday. He’s made very clear that he wants to reposition Tesla as an AI company. The promise of robotaxis that can take you to work and robots that water your plants is why Tesla’s investors recently offered Musk a $1 trillion pay package even as the company’s car sales are slumping and slumping. If cars like the Model S changed the world, the investors would argue, then there’s no reason to believe that Musk’s vision for robots can’t do something even grander. (Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.)

This plan had better work. Now that Tesla seems largely done with making new car models, the company is throwing away a lot in order to go all in on autonomy. The irony is that in canceling the Model S, Tesla is effectively walking away from a business that it helped create. Even at its apex, the Model S never sold as well as something like the Toyota Camry. (The Tesla’s initial starting price of about $100,000 immediately put it out of reach for most car buyers.) But it is undoubtedly the most important car of the 21st century. The global EV industry would not be what it is today without it.

Perhaps the biggest legacy of the Model S is that it turned cars into gadgets. From the get-go, Tesla owners enjoyed a parade of new features rolled out via software downloads. Until the Model S, whatever features your car had at purchase were essentially all you ever got, unless you modified it yourself or paid a shop to do it. Tesla pioneered the idea of a car that could, like a smartphone, get better over time with digital upgrades. At times, software updates can be a nuisance for drivers: Some features are now locked behind a subscription paywall. This kind of approach has made Tesla a tech company, with a stock price more reminiscent of Silicon Valley than of Detroit. Tesla is now worth more than most other car companies combined.

Naturally, other automakers were eager to replicate the Tesla playbook. By the late 2010s, the rest of the industry was scrambling to chase Tesla’s progress and innovation (and that stock price). Other companies have since sunk billions of dollars into EVs, batteries, and software, all to varying degrees of success. Software updates are something the sector is still struggling with. Even last year, when Tesla’s profits and sales sank, most Americans who bought an EV were opting for Teslas. And when Tesla set up its factory in China, it kicked that country’s auto industry into high gear. Now electric cars from companies such as Geely and Xiaomi handily outclass many of Tesla’s cars; the auto giant BYD just eclipsed Tesla to become the world’s biggest seller of EVs. Perhaps that’s why Tesla is moving away from making cars; it’s now up against dozens of other Teslas that have government support and considerable financial resources.

The Model S may have another enduring legacy: In addition to turning Tesla into an EV juggernaut, it also laid the groundwork for Musk’s eventual obsession with robots and robotaxis. Tesla’s “Autopilot” feature, which allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel on the highway and while parallel parking, debuted as a software upgrade on the Model S. Over time, this evolved into “Full Self-Driving,” for hands-free driving in cities. It’s the basis for Tesla’s AI-powered autonomous-car dreams and its hopes for robotics: A humanoid robot like Optimus should theoretically “see” and operate in the world much the same way.

The fight against ICE in Minneapolis defies easy categorization. Is it activism? Protest? Political opposition? Resistance? None of these terms quite captures what we’re seeing: people putting their own bodies on the line to care for immigrants and impede the operations of a paramilitary force in their city. My colleagues have come up with their own, apt ways to describe it: Maybe this is “neighborism,” or a movement for “basic decency.” I like the way an elderly couple named Dan and Jane, in one dispatch, explained their motive for joining the effort: “humanist.”

The word that comes to my mind is dissidence. If we want to understand why the whistleblowing, camera-wielding people of Minneapolis have caused the Trump administration—and Donald Trump himself—to flinch, I believe we need some added history, and a bigger map. What we’ve been watching is part of a long, established tradition—one that might help Americans unlock a different kind of future.

Dissidence is not revolution; it is not even political opposition. It’s something much more elemental. It emerges in environments where power—usually government power—tramples on the basic conditions of life as people know and value them. We recognize what this means in Minneapolis: People do not like to see their neighbors terrified and rounded up. They do not like to see masked men with guns acting with impunity. They do not like their children being too afraid to go to school. Unlike, say, the “pussy hat” protests that immediately followed Trump’s first inauguration and launched what came to be known as the resistance, the reaction of regular people in Minneapolis is not, fundamentally, about an ideological or policy disagreement with the administration. The movement that has arisen on the city’s frigid streets is about defending what any reasonable American would call “normal”—the expectation of a life without the threat of violence and coercion.

This is when the dissident has always stepped in. Since Trump’s first term, historians have been furnishing us with analogies from the past to help explain our unprecedented political reality—many more people now feel comfortable uttering words such as authoritarianism, even fascism. But when it comes to the mindset and actions necessary to stand up to these forces, the past also provides precedents—and role models—that we shouldn’t ignore. For as long as tyranny has existed, there have been people who resist the pressures of conformity or even the natural instinct toward self-preservation in order to say “no.”

The dissidence of Minneapolis reminds me of the Argentinian mothers who found themselves in an impossible situation during the military junta of the late 1970s. Their children, deemed "subversives” for their work with the poor or their leftist politics, were abducted in the middle of the night, disappeared without explanation. The most obvious choice for each of these mothers was to keep quiet, to avoid drawing attention to her family. But some refused to do so. They started searching and asking questions, and eventually they joined together to stand week after week, year after year, outside the presidential palace with signs that read Where are they?

Today’s dissidence also reminds me of the Underground Railroad. Think of what this network of liberation demanded: all of those innkeepers, church deacons, farmers, and housewives risking violence and potential arrest in a country that was, as Frederick Douglass put it, “given up to be a hunting-ground for slaveholders.” In an environment of terror—the Fugitive Slave Acts made harboring a runaway a federal crime—these individuals conducted their own moral calculus: Slavery was an abnormality, one worth obstructing in any way, at any cost.

This is not a history of people practicing politics or fighting for regime change. It is, in fact, humanist. These people are not looking to replace one governing order or ideology with another. They are fighting an incursion, reacting to a violation of humanity, and deciding to do something about it.

Another dissident comes to mind, a familiar if anonymous one. Most people assume that the man in that famous photo from 1989 who stood in front of a line of tanks near Tiananmen Square was trying to block them from crushing the democracy protests. And that may have been his intent. (No one ever learned his identity or his fate.) But I see something else in that lone figure carrying two shopping bags: a man who is perhaps heading home to prepare dinner, who has a recipe in mind, who has been planning what music to listen to on his cassette player that night and remembering the details of a conversation with his wife, when four tanks suddenly appear in his path. They are blocking his path, not the other way around. The dissident insists on continuing his journey home. He refuses to move out of the way.

The dissident who probably thought most about what it means to be a dissident was Václav Havel, the Czech playwright who, in 1989, became the first democratically elected president of his country. Havel understood dissidence, at its inception, as not being political at all; he considered it, rather, “pre-political.” It could emerge from wanting to play strange music, wear one’s hair long, speak one’s mind, defend one’s economic interests, or protect vulnerable neighbors. When you are not allowed to assert these core aspects of who you are—to be a fully autonomous human—you face a choice: Either abandon those parts of yourself, or refuse to and become a dissident.

One of Havel’s greatest achievements was Charter 77, a petition—and then a movement—that became a sustained opposition to the Communist regime. But he was always quick to point out that what launched the whole effort was the arrest of a band of anemic-looking, long-haired rock musicians called the Plastic People of the Universe. Their only crime, it seems, was wanting to play weird, psychedelic music redolent of Frank Zappa. There was nothing subversive about their songs—many of which were about loving beer—and so it was not hard to appreciate what was being suppressed when the musicians were put on trial and sentenced to prison, nor were the stakes for every free person difficult to understand.

This elemental appeal of dissidence is easier to see when we compare it with the resistance that has marked most of the Trump years. The tactics of activists have largely included mass protests, most recently those of No Kings Day, as well as smaller, simpler ones, say, chanting and ringing bells in front of Tesla showrooms. Such acts are useful for bolstering your own political side, for creating a sense of solidarity. But they don’t usually help widen the circle of opposition. They are more like pep rallies—not without value, but also easy to ignore. The same can be said of the resistance’s main message, which tends to focus on Trump’s threats to democracy and the rule of law. This, too, is not pre-political, because it tends to alienate those who don’t already agree with this dire (if accurate) analysis.

Compare the grievances of these protests with the issues and stakes that dissidents have revealed in Minneapolis. The assault by federal agents was an attack on something pre-political, on parts of our communal existence that people, in normal times, take for granted. You should be able to assume that parents, immigrant or not, won’t be ripped away from children. You should assume that people don’t have to hide in their house because their skin is brown or black. You should assume that filming an interaction with the police won’t end in your death. These are all pre-political assumptions, and we hold them not as Democrats or Republicans, but as individuals who just want to live freely.

Havel, surprisingly, didn’t much like the word dissident and used it, he said, “with distaste, rather ironically, and almost always in quotation marks.” He worried that the label gave the impression that there was some rarefied class of people whose job it was to be “professional malcontents”; dissidents, he insisted, were just “ordinary people with ordinary cares.” What made them special was their defense of those pre-political instincts that we all share. Does the fact that they are defending something so basic diminish what dissidents do? I don’t think so. How many people really are willing to sacrifice so much for the sake of just being human?

When it comes to Trump, we’ve just seen dissidence gain a tactical victory where resistance has failed. The question for those appalled by the actions of this administration has always been how to get more people to share a morally grounded outlook on what is happening to the country. This is hard, to put it mildly. Almost every news event gets filtered through a tribal lens (and the tribalized media that supports it). Even the death of Renee Good, caught on video from multiple angles, was largely interpreted in partisan ways.

But since the killing of Alex Pretti, something has shifted. A wider swath of people are beginning to perceive the state’s violence against its citizens as an abnormality. Just listen to the Republican who dropped out of the race for Minnesota governor in part because of what he was seeing in Minneapolis: “I cannot support the national Republicans’ stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so.” The change could be felt even in Trump himself, who demoted the man running the Border Patrol operation in the city and spoke of the need to “de-escalate a little bit”—not a phrase that’s commonly in his vocabulary. We are a long way from justice for these two deaths, but to judge by polls and even Fox News coverage, many more people now agree that a violation has taken place.

This happened because of the American dissidents in Minneapolis. They have organized outside of the spotlight, and not toward a nationwide mobilization but with a sharp, local focus on their neighbors. They communicate on Signal channels, stand guard outside elementary schools, bring food to scared immigrants sheltering in their homes. They have placed an emphasis on watchfulness, on care, on safety and calculated risk—all qualities that characterized dissidents in the Soviet Union and characterize them today in Tehran and Beijing. Their actions resulted in images that bore moral witness to what federal agents are doing in their city. But they also established a sharp contrast that people with open eyes and goodwill could not fail to recognize.

The American dissidence, should it continue and grow, will need to look different from the resistance of months and years past. It will need to focus on what is common to all of us, what Havel called “the aims of life.” We share many more of these aims than we sometimes realize. We may disagree about tax rates and foreign policy, gun rights and rent freezes, but “normal” is a universal concept in America when it comes to what we expect for our children, our communities, and our sense of security and well-being. To be a dissident in this moment means moving beyond scoring points and underscoring differences, and on to recognizing what we are all losing—and blowing a whistle in order to prevent that loss.

Dissidence might seem to be a lonely act. It has always started that way. But what is called for now is the spirit of that man in Tiananmen Square, that immovable character, a human who insists on getting home to do the things that give his life purpose and will not let a few tanks get in his way.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Film professors across the United States are reporting a growing attention-span crisis among students, including those majoring in film studies. Instructors note that students increasingly struggle to sit through feature-length movies without checking their phones, often opting to skip through films or watch them at double speed when streaming assignments independently, leading to a diminished ability to engage with and analyze cinema.

        Everyone knows it’s hard to get college students to do the reading—remember books? But the attention-span crisis is not limited to the written word. Professors are now finding that they can’t even get film students—film students—to sit through movies. “I used to think, If homework is watching a movie, that is the best homework ever,” Craig Erpelding, a film professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, told me. “But students will not do it.”

I heard similar observations from 20 film-studies professors around the country. They told me that over the past decade, and particularly since the pandemic, students have struggled to pay attention to feature-length films. Malcolm Turvey, the founding director of Tufts University’s Film and Media Studies Program, officially bans electronics during film screenings. Enforcing the ban is another matter: About half the class ends up looking furtively at their phones.

A handful of professors told me they hadn’t noticed any change. Some students have always found old movies to be slow, Lynn Spigel, a professor of screen cultures at Northwestern University, told me. “But the ones who are really dedicated to learning film always were into it, and they still are.”

Most of the instructors I spoke with, however, feel that something is different now. And the problem is not limited to large introductory courses. Akira Mizuta Lippit, a cinema and media-studies professor at the University of Southern California—home to perhaps the top film program in the country—said that his students remind him of nicotine addicts going through withdrawal during screenings: The longer they go without checking their phone, the more they fidget. Eventually, they give in. He recently screened the 1974 Francis Ford Coppola classic The Conversation. At the outset, he told students that even if they ignored parts of the film, they needed to watch the famously essential and prophetic final scene. Even that request proved too much for some of the class. When the scene played, Lippit noticed that several students were staring at their phones, he told me. “You do have to just pay attention at the very end, and I just can’t get everybody to do that,” he said.

Many students are resisting the idea of in-person screenings altogether. Given the ease of streaming assignments from their dorm rooms, they see gathering in a campus theater as an imposition. Professors whose syllabi require in-person screenings outside of class time might see their enrollment drop, Meredith Ward, director of the Program in Film and Media Studies at Johns Hopkins University, told me. Accordingly, many professors now allow students to stream movies on their own time.

You can imagine how that turns out. At Indiana University, where Erpelding worked until 2024, professors could track whether students watched films on the campus’s internal streaming platform. Fewer than 50 percent would even start the movies, he said, and only about 20 percent made it to the end. (Recall that these are students who chose to take a film class.) Even when students stream the entire film, it’s not clear how closely they watch it. Some are surely folding laundry or scrolling Instagram, or both, while the movie plays.

The students I spoke with admitted to their own inattentiveness. They even felt bad about it. But that wasn’t enough to make them sit through the assigned movies. Mridula Natarajan, a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, took a world-cinema class this past fall. “There were some movies that were extremely slow-paced, and ironically, that was the point of the movie,” she told me. “But I guess impatience made me skip through stuff or watch it on two-times speed.”

After watching movies distractedly—if they watch them at all—students unsurprisingly can’t answer basic questions about what they saw. In a multiple-choice question on a recent final exam, Jeff Smith, a film professor at UW Madison, asked what happens at the end of the Truffaut film Jules and Jim. More than half of the class picked one of the wrong options, saying that characters hide from the Nazis (the film takes place during World War I) or get drunk with Ernest Hemingway (who does not appear in the movie). Smith has administered similar exams for almost two decades; he had to grade his most recent exam on a curve to keep students’ marks within a normal range.

The professors I spoke with didn’t blame students for their shortcomings; they focused instead on how media diets have changed. From 1997 to 2014, screen time for children under age 2 doubled. And the screen in question, once a television, is now more likely to be a tablet or a smartphone. Students arriving in college today have no memory of a world before the infinite scroll. As teenagers, they spent nearly five hours a day on social media, with much of that time used for flicking from one short-form video to the next. An analysis of people’s attention while working on a computer found that they now switch between tabs or apps every 47 seconds, down from once every two and a half minutes in 2004. “I can imagine that if your body and your psychology are not trained for the duration of a feature-length film, it will just feel excruciatingly long,” USC’s Lippit said. (He also hypothesized that, because every movie is available on demand, students feel that they can always rewatch should they miss something—even if they rarely take advantage of that option.)

Kyle Stine, a film and media-studies professor at Johns Hopkins, usually begins his course with an icebreaker: What’s a movie you watched recently? In the past few years, some students have struggled to name any film. Kristen Warner, a performing- and media-arts professor at Cornell University, has noticed a similar trend. Some of her students arrive having seen only Disney movies. Erpelding, at UW Madison, said he tries to find a movie that everyone in his class has seen, to serve as a shared reference point they can talk about. Lately, that’s become impossible. Even students who are interested in going into filmmaking don’t necessarily love watching films. “The disconnect is that 10 years ago, people who wanted to go study film and media creation were cinephiles themselves,” Erpelding told me. “Nowadays, they’re people that consume the same thing everyone else consumes, which is social media.”

Of course, young people haven’t given up on movies altogether. But the feature films that they do watch now tend to be engineered to cater to their attentional deficit. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Matt Damon, the star of many movies that college students may not have seen, said that Netflix has started encouraging filmmakers to put action sequences in the first five minutes of a film to get viewers hooked. And just because young people are streaming movies, it doesn’t mean they’re paying attention. When they sit down to watch, many are browsing social media on a second screen. Netflix has accordingly advised directors to have characters repeat the plot three or four times so that multitasking audiences can keep up with what’s happening, Damon said.

Some professors are treating wilting attention spans as a problem to be solved, not a reality to accept. Stine, at Johns Hopkins, is piloting a course on “slow cinema”—minimalist films with almost no narrative thrust—with the goal of helping students redevelop long modes of attention. Rick Warner, the director of film studies at the University of North Carolina, deliberately selects films with slow pacing and subtle details, such as Chantal Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles, a three-hour movie that mostly follows a woman doing chores in her apartment. “I try to teach films that put their habits of viewing under strain,” Warner told me. “I’m trying to sell them on the idea that a film watched properly can actually help them retrain their perception and can teach them how to concentrate again.” Once they get used to it, students enjoy the challenge, he said.

But other professors, perhaps concluding that resistance is futile, are adjusting to the media their students grew up on. Some show shorter films or have students watch movies over multiple sittings. Erpelding, who primarily teaches filmmaking courses, has moved from teaching traditional production methods to explaining how to maximize audience engagement. He now asks students to make three- or four-minute films, similar to the social-media edits they see online. After all, that seems to be the only type of video many young people want to watch.

By the way, the last scene of The Conversation has the paranoid Gene Hackman destroying his apartment in a desperate and futile search for listening devices. He eventually gives up, and mournfully plays the saxophone amid the wreckage. It’s a brilliant scene, and worth the wait.

        <hr/>
        Recently, I watched a new documentary about an enigmatic woman of notable charm and courage preparing for one of the most momentous events in her life. That woman is E. Jean Carroll, and the movie is Ask E. Jean, a feature about Carroll’s life and her decision to sue President Trump in civil court for defamation and sexual battery.

In 2019, Carroll alleged that Trump had sexually assaulted her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the mid-1990s; Trump promptly denied the allegation while deriding Carroll at rallies and in TV interviews as “totally lying” and “not my type.” Ask E. Jean follows Carroll as she prepares for the trial, revealing why she buried what had happened for so long; it captures, too, her profound discomfort while she’s badgered during depositions by Trump’s legal team, and her eventual victory. (The jury found Trump liable for the sexual abuse and defamation of Carroll and ordered him to pay $5 million in compensation; Trump’s appeal is currently awaiting review by the Supreme Court.)

But very few people have seen Ask E. Jean or even heard of it. Streaming platforms and distributors have steered absolutely clear of a movie that so plainly impugns the president, regardless of its obvious relevance and engaging portrait of Carroll, whose decision to come forward was resolutely in spite of everything she knew she’d face as a result. “We all have a lot at stake here. This lawsuit is not just for me; it almost has nothing to do with me,” she explains in one scene to the director, Ivy Meeropol. “It’s for, really, women across the country.” In court, Carroll faced lawyers for a former (now reelected) president, making the case, as she puts it, that Trump was protected by “his scope of employment as president when he called me too hideous to rape.”

The president’s lack of impulse control and trigger-happy litigiousness have often collapsed in court, but they’ve had a profound impact on the entertainment industry. Both ABC and CBS have settled lawsuits served by Trump rather than fight, seemingly deducing that the cost and capitulation are worth it if they smooth the way for mergers and keep the mercurial and media-fixated president off their backs. (“A big fat bribe” is how the late-night host Stephen Colbert characterized CBS’s $16 million settlement to Trump, shortly before his own CBS show was canceled; CBS called the cancellation “purely a financial decision.”) And so you can’t see Ask E. Jean, but you have no end of options this weekend when it comes to watching a documentary about the current first lady, Melania: Twenty Days to History, whose unusual genesis (a $40 million bid from Amazon, which was reported to include a roughly $28 million personal fee for Melania Trump, and a further $35 million marketing budget) and aggressive rollout across more than 3,300 theaters reveal an awful lot about our entertainment infrastructure, none of it good.

To be fair, most people involved with Melania do seem to feel shame, if not the ones who matter. The publicity emails sent from Amazon regarding the movie have no individual names or email addresses attached, as though no one wanted their career or personal brand sullied by association. A report in Rolling Stone this week alleged that two-thirds of the production crew based in New York who worked on the film similarly asked to be uncredited. (“I feel a little bit uncomfortable with the propaganda element of this,” one reportedly said.) Melania is directed by Brett Ratner, best known for the Rush Hour franchise and for the multiple allegations of sexual assault and harassment leveled at him by half a dozen people in 2017. (Ratner has denied or disputed the allegations; Melania marks his return to public life after a nine-year absence, although a photo of Ratner with the accused sex trafficker Jean-Luc Brunel—now deceased—did pop up in the last month.)

At the Melania screening I attended today, what was most surprising about the movie was how little is actually in it, despite a running time just shy of two hours. Mostly, Ratner captures his subject walking from liminal place to liminal place in five-inch heels, the camera trailing her like a lap dog. She looks immediately uncomfortable being filmed, an effect that never quite goes away. In voiceover, she opines vaguely about wanting the film to capture her motivations as first lady. “Every day I live with purpose and devotion,” she explains, while we see her being fitted for her inauguration outfit, working with designers to manage the aesthetic of the presidential balls, and interviewing various white women with barrel curls to join her staff. She talks proudly about having, during Trump’s first term, restored the White House Rose Garden (unfortunately since converted by her husband into a paved patio area).

Ratner seems desperate to find action, but there is none. The pace is stultifying. The camera lingers on a designer’s aide who trembles at the task of trimming Melania’s inaugural blouse with scissors. We see the first lady videoconference with Brigitte Macron, her French counterpart, about her Be Best initiative. Halfway through, Ratner picks up what seems to be Melania’s father’s Super 8 camera and never puts it down, so the latter part of the film is studded with grainy handheld scenes of helicopters and Arlington National Cemetery. Trump is inaugurated—Ratner uncharitably includes scenes of a backstage Kamala Harris looking pissed off—and we follow the president and his wife to three balls. Melania shows off her custom-made inauguration gown, stark white with black ribbons overlaying it, a dress that now looks unavoidably like the redacted Epstein files.

What’s in the film—lots of shots of tech bosses paying homage to Trump, Ratner trying to get Melania to sing along to “Billie Jean,” Melania’s insistence on the sacred values of the Constitution and its protection of individual rights—is almost less compelling than what’s not. (Any glimpse of Stephen Miller.) But Melania’s heavy focus on its subject, despite her husband being one of the most attention-sucking people on the planet, does raise one interesting question: Is his wife the only person Trump can stand being upstaged by? Throughout, the president seems truly proud and enamored of Melania. “You look beautiful, beautiful,” he tells her in one scene. “Like a movie star.” (I laughed out loud at one phone call, during which Melania, in New York, seems exasperated when her husband won’t shut up about how big his election victory was.)

What might make people curious to see Melania, despite the movie’s questionable origins and terrible timing—the merch-heavy White House premiere for the movie on Saturday night coincided with mass grief and outrage in America over the killing of the ICU nurse Alex Pretti by federal agents—is the fact that Melania Trump is our least accessible first lady in recent memory. Like all true divas, she mostly declines to reveal herself in public these days unless there’s a formal event or something to sell. Almost all of her Instagram posts over the past year have promoted her movie, her branded ornament collection, her memecoin, or her “AI audiobook.” At her husband’s second inauguration, she wore a black-and-white broad-brimmed hat that covered half of her face and kept everyone near her at arm’s length. (On a state visit to the United Kingdom, she opted for a dark-purple version so forbidding that you couldn’t see her at all, an aesthetic the website Defector labeled “Babadook mode.”) The first lady is both “fiercely private,” according to one of her former confidantes, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, and largely unbothered by scandal. “For her,” Wolkoff wrote in her 2020 book, Melania and Me, “public disgrace was nothing more than brushing sand off her feet after a quick stroll on the beach.”

Others might not be as adept at doing so. It bears underlining here that first ladies prior to Melania have typically declined—out of a sense of propriety rather than specific ethical constraints—to profit directly from their role while in office. Trump world has been notably different in this regard. The idea for a documentary was supposedly sparked by the success of Melania’s 2024 memoir of the same title, in which she ignored the dozens of women who’d accused her husband of sexual assault, Carroll among them, but spent four full pages analyzing a failed caviar-based skin-care line she’d hoped to launch. (Donald Trump has always denied any allegations of assault and harassment.) “It is my sincere wish that you will find inspiration in my journey,” the first lady wrote in the introduction, before gliding over highly selective accounts of her early days dating “Donald,” her jewelry line for QVC, her “proactive adoption of blockchain technologies” (Melania-branded non-fungible tokens and cryptocurrencies), and her relationships with her stepchildren, which apparently benefit from “boundaries.”

        Anthropic has completed a Series F fundraising of $13 billion led by ICONIQ. This financing values Anthropic at $183 billion post-money. Along with ICONIQ, the round was co-led by Fidelity Management & Research Company and Lightspeed Venture Partners. The investment reflects Anthropic’s continued momentum and reinforces our position as the leading intelligence platform for enterprises, developers, and power users.

Significant investors in this round include Altimeter, Baillie Gifford, affiliated funds of BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, D1 Capital Partners, General Atlantic, General Catalyst, GIC, Growth Equity at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, Insight Partners, Jane Street, Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, Qatar Investment Authority, TPG, T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., T. Rowe Price Investment Management, Inc., WCM Investment Management, and XN.

“From Fortune 500 companies to AI-native startups, our customers rely on Anthropic’s frontier models and platform products for their most important, mission-critical work,” said Krishna Rao, Chief Financial Officer of Anthropic. “We are seeing exponential growth in demand across our entire customer base. This financing demonstrates investors’ extraordinary confidence in our financial performance and the strength of their collaboration with us to continue fueling our unprecedented growth.”

Anthropic has seen rapid growth since the launch of Claude in March 2023. At the beginning of 2025, less than two years after launch, Anthropic’s run-rate revenue had grown to approximately $1 billion. By August 2025, just eight months later, our run-rate revenue reached over $5 billion—making Anthropic one of the fastest-growing technology companies in history.

Anthropic’s trajectory has been driven by our leading technical talent, our focus on safety, and our frontier research, including pioneering alignment and interpretability work, all of which underpin the performance and reliability of our models. Every day more businesses, developers, and consumer power users are trusting Claude to help them solve their most challenging problems. Anthropic now serves over 300,000 business customers, and our number of large accounts—customers that each represent over $100,000 in run-rate revenue—has grown nearly 7x in the past year.

This growth spans the entire Anthropic platform, with advancements for businesses, developers, and consumers. For businesses, our API and industry-specific products make it easy to add powerful AI to their critical applications without complex integration work. Developers have made Claude Code their tool of choice since its full launch in May 2025. Claude Code has quickly taken off—already generating over $500 million in run-rate revenue with usage growing more than 10x in just three months. For individual users, the Pro and Max plans for Claude deliver enhanced AI capabilities for everyday tasks and specialized projects.

“Anthropic is on an exceptional trajectory, combining research excellence, technological leadership, and relentless focus on customers. We’re honored to partner with Dario and the team, and our lead investment in their Series F reflects our belief in their values and their ability to shape the future of responsible AI,” said Divesh Makan, Partner at ICONIQ. “Enterprise leaders tell us what we’re seeing firsthand—Claude is reliable, built on a trustworthy foundation, and guided by leaders truly focused on the long term.”

The Series F investment will expand our capacity to meet growing enterprise demand, deepen our safety research, and support international expansion as we continue building reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.

        <hr/>
        There is a scene in the movie version of Carl Sagan’s book Contact where the main character, an astronomer who has detected the first radio signal from an alien civilization, is being considered for the role of humanity’s representative to meet the aliens. The international panel interviewing her asks, “If you could ask [the aliens] just one question, what would it be?” Her reply is: “I’d ask them, ‘How did you do it? How did you evolve, how did you survive this technological adolescence without destroying yourself?” When I think about where humanity is now with AI—about what we’re on the cusp of—my mind keeps going back to that scene, because the question is so apt for our current situation, and I wish we had the aliens’ answer to guide us. I believe we are entering a rite of passage, both turbulent and inevitable, which will test who we are as a species. Humanity is about to be handed almost unimaginable power, and it is deeply unclear whether our social, political, and technological systems possess the maturity to wield it.

In my essay Machines of Loving Grace, I tried to lay out the dream of a civilization that had made it through to adulthood, where the risks had been addressed and powerful AI was applied with skill and compassion to raise the quality of life for everyone. I suggested that AI could contribute to enormous advances in biology, neuroscience, economic development, global peace, and work and meaning. I felt it was important to give people something inspiring to fight for, a task at which both AI accelerationists and AI safety advocates seemed—oddly—to have failed. But in this current essay, I want to confront the rite of passage itself: to map out the risks that we are about to face and try to begin making a battle plan to defeat them. I believe deeply in our ability to prevail, in humanity’s spirit and its nobility, but we must face the situation squarely and without illusions.

As with talking about the benefits, I think it is important to discuss risks in a careful and well-considered manner. In particular, I think it is critical to:

Avoid doomerism. Here, I mean “doomerism” not just in the sense of believing doom is inevitable (which is both a false and self-fulfilling belief), but more generally, thinking about AI risks in a quasi-religious way.1 Many people have been thinking in an analytic and sober way about AI risks for many years, but it’s my impression that during the peak of worries about AI risk in 2023–2024, some of the least sensible voices rose to the top, often through sensationalistic social media accounts. These voices used off-putting language reminiscent of religion or science fiction, and called for extreme actions without having the evidence that would justify them. It was clear even then that a backlash was inevitable, and that the issue would become culturally polarized and therefore gridlocked.2 As of 2025–2026, the pendulum has swung, and AI opportunity, not AI risk, is driving many political decisions. This vacillation is unfortunate, as the technology itself doesn’t care about what is fashionable, and we are considerably closer to real danger in 2026 than we were in 2023. The lesson is that we need to discuss and address risks in a realistic, pragmatic manner: sober, fact-based, and well equipped to survive changing tides.

Acknowledge uncertainty. There are plenty of ways in which the concerns I’m raising in this piece could be moot. Nothing here is intended to communicate certainty or even likelihood. Most obviously, AI may simply not advance anywhere near as fast as I imagine.3 Or, even if it does advance quickly, some or all of the risks discussed here may not materialize (which would be great), or there may be other risks I haven’t considered. No one can predict the future with complete confidence—but we have to do the best we can to plan anyway.

Intervene as surgically as possible. Addressing the risks of AI will require a mix of voluntary actions taken by companies (and private third-party actors) and actions taken by governments that bind everyone. The voluntary actions—both taking them and encouraging other companies to follow suit—are a no-brainer for me. I firmly believe that government actions will also be required to some extent, but these interventions are different in character because they can potentially destroy economic value or coerce unwilling actors who are skeptical of these risks (and there is some chance they are right!). It’s also common for regulations to backfire or worsen the problem they are intended to solve (and this is even more true for rapidly changing technologies). It’s thus very important for regulations to be judicious: they should seek to avoid collateral damage, be as simple as possible, and impose the least burden necessary to get the job done.4 It is easy to say, “No action is too extreme when the fate of humanity is at stake!,” but in practice this attitude simply leads to backlash. To be clear, I think there’s a decent chance we eventually reach a point where much more significant action is warranted, but that will depend on stronger evidence of imminent, concrete danger than we have today, as well as enough specificity about the danger to formulate rules that have a chance of addressing it. The most constructive thing we can do today is advocate for limited rules while we learn whether or not there is evidence to support stronger ones.5

With all that said, I think the best starting place for talking about AI’s risks is the same place I started from in talking about its benefits: by being precise about what level of AI we are talking about. The level of AI that raises civilizational concerns for me is the powerful AI that I described in Machines of Loving Grace. I’ll simply repeat here the definition that I gave in that document:

<blockquote>

By “powerful AI,” I have in mind an AI model—likely similar to today’s LLMs in form, though it might be based on a different architecture, might involve several interacting models, and might be trained differently—with the following properties:

In terms of pure intelligence, it is smarter than a Nobel Prize winner across most relevant fields: biology, programming, math, engineering, writing, etc. This means it can prove unsolved mathematical theorems, write extremely good novels, write difficult codebases from scratch, etc.

In addition to just being a “smart thing you talk to,” it has all the interfaces available to a human working virtually, including text, audio, video, mouse and keyboard control, and internet access. It can engage in any actions, communications, or remote operations enabled by this interface, including taking actions on the internet, taking or giving directions to humans, ordering materials, directing experiments, watching videos, making videos, and so on. It does all of these tasks with, again, a skill exceeding that of the most capable humans in the world.

It does not just passively answer questions; instead, it can be given tasks that take hours, days, or weeks to complete, and then goes off and does those tasks autonomously, in the way a smart employee would, asking for clarification as necessary.

It does not have a physical embodiment (other than living on a computer screen), but it can control existing physical tools, robots, or laboratory equipment through a computer; in theory, it could even design robots or equipment for itself to use.

The resources used to train the model can be repurposed to run millions of instances of it (this matches projected cluster sizes by ~2027), and the model can absorb information and generate actions at roughly 10–100x human speed. It may, however, be limited by the response time of the physical world or of software it interacts with.

Each of these million copies can act independently on unrelated tasks, or, if needed can all work together in the same way humans would collaborate, perhaps with different subpopulations fine-tuned to be especially good at particular tasks.

We could summarize this as a “country of geniuses in a datacenter.”

</blockquote>

As I wrote in Machines of Loving Grace, powerful AI could be as little as 1–2 years away, although it could also be considerably further out.6 Exactly when powerful AI will arrive is a complex topic that deserves an essay of its own, but for now I’ll simply explain very briefly why I think there’s a strong chance it could be very soon.

My co-founders at Anthropic and I were among the first to document and track the “scaling laws” of AI systems—the observation that as we add more compute and training tasks, AI systems get predictably better at essentially every cognitive skill we are able to measure. Every few months, public sentiment either becomes convinced that AI is “hitting a wall” or becomes excited about some new breakthrough that will “fundamentally change the game,” but the truth is that behind the volatility and public speculation, there has been a smooth, unyielding increase in AI’s cognitive capabilities.

We are now at the point where AI models are beginning to make progress in solving unsolved mathematical problems, and are good enough at coding that some of the strongest engineers I’ve ever met are now handing over almost all their coding to AI. Three years ago, AI struggled with elementary school arithmetic problems and was barely capable of writing a single line of code. Similar rates of improvement are occurring across biological science, finance, physics, and a variety of agentic tasks. If the exponential continues—which is not certain, but now has a decade-long track record supporting it—then it cannot possibly be more than a few years before AI is better than humans at essentially everything.

In fact, that picture probably underestimates the likely rate of progress. Because AI is now writing much of the code at Anthropic, it is already substantially accelerating the rate of our progress in building the next generation of AI systems. This feedback loop is gathering steam month by month, and may be only 1–2 years away from a point where the current generation of AI autonomously builds the next. This loop has already started, and will accelerate rapidly in the coming months and years. Watching the last 5 years of progress from within Anthropic, and looking at how even the next few months of models are shaping up, I can feel the pace of progress, and the clock ticking down.

In this essay, I’ll assume that this intuition is at least somewhat correct—not that powerful AI is definitely coming in 1–2 years,7 but that there’s a decent chance it does, and a very strong chance it comes in the next few. As with Machines of Loving Grace, taking this premise seriously can lead to some surprising and eerie conclusions. While in Machines of Loving Grace I focused on the positive implications of this premise, here the things I talk about will be disquieting. They are conclusions that we may not want to confront, but that does not make them any less real. I can only say that I am focused day and night on how to steer us away from these negative outcomes and towards the positive ones, and in this essay I talk in great detail about how best to do so.

I think the best way to get a handle on the risks of AI is to ask the following question: suppose a literal “country of geniuses” were to materialize somewhere in the world in ~2027. Imagine, say, 50 million people, all of whom are much more capable than any Nobel Prize winner, statesman, or technologist. The analogy is not perfect, because these geniuses could have an extremely wide range of motivations and behavior, from completely pliant and obedient, to strange and alien in their motivations. But sticking with the analogy for now, suppose you were the national security advisor of a major state, responsible for assessing and responding to the situation. Imagine, further, that because AI systems can operate hundreds of times faster than humans, this “country” is operating with a time advantage relative to all other countries: for every cognitive action we can take, this country can take ten.

What should you be worried about? I would worry about the following things:

Autonomy risks. What are the intentions and goals of this country? Is it hostile, or does it share our values? Could it militarily dominate the world through superior weapons, cyber operations, influence operations, or manufacturing?

Misuse for destruction. Assume the new country is malleable and “follows instructions”—and thus is essentially a country of mercenaries. Could existing rogue actors who want to cause destruction (such as terrorists) use or manipulate some of the people in the new country to make themselves much more effective, greatly amplifying the scale of destruction?

Misuse for seizing power. What if the country was in fact built and controlled by an existing powerful actor, such as a dictator or rogue corporate actor? Could that actor use it to gain decisive or dominant power over the world as a whole, upsetting the existing balance of power?

Economic disruption. If the new country is not a security threat in any of the ways listed in #1–3 above but simply participates peacefully in the global economy, could it still create severe risks simply by being so technologically advanced and effective that it disrupts the global economy, causing mass unemployment or radically concentrating wealth?

Indirect effects. The world will change very quickly due to all the new technology and productivity that will be created by the new country. Could some of these changes be radically destabilizing?

I think it should be clear that this is a dangerous situation—a report from a competent national security official to a head of state would probably contain words like “the single most serious national security threat we’ve faced in a century, possibly ever.” It seems like something the best minds of civilization should be focused on.

Conversely, I think it would be absurd to shrug and say, “Nothing to worry about here!” But, faced with rapid AI progress, that seems to be the view of many US policymakers, some of whom deny the existence of any AI risks, when they are not distracted entirely by the usual tired old hot-button issues.8 Humanity needs to wake up, and this essay is an attempt—a possibly futile one, but it’s worth trying—to jolt people awake.

To be clear, I believe if we act decisively and carefully, the risks can be overcome—I would even say our odds are good. And there’s a hugely better world on the other side of it. But we need to understand that this is a serious civilizational challenge. Below, I go through the five categories of risk laid out above, along with my thoughts on how to address them.

1. I’m sorry, Dave

Autonomy risks

A country of geniuses in a datacenter could divide their efforts among software design, cyber operations, R&D for physical technologies, relationship building, and statecraft. It is clear that, if for some reason it chose to do so, this country would have a fairly good shot at taking over the world (either militarily or in terms of influence and control) and imposing its will on everyone else—or doing any number of other things that the rest of the world doesn’t want and can’t stop. We’ve obviously been worried about this for human countries (such as Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union), so it stands to reason that the same is possible for a much smarter and more capable “AI country.”

The best possible counterargument is that the AI geniuses, under my definition, won’t have a physical embodiment, but remember that they can take control of existing robotic infrastructure (such as self-driving cars) and can also accelerate robotics R&D or build a fleet of robots.9 It’s also unclear whether having a physical presence is even necessary for effective control: plenty of human action is already performed on behalf of people whom the actor has not physically met.

The key question, then, is the “if it chose to” part: what’s the likelihood that our AI models would behave in such a way, and under what conditions would they do so?

As with many issues, it’s helpful to think through the spectrum of possible answers to this question by considering two opposite positions. The first position is that this simply can’t happen, because the AI models will be trained to do what humans ask them to do, and it’s therefore absurd to imagine that they would do something dangerous unprompted. According to this line of thinking, we don’t worry about a Roomba or a model airplane going rogue and murdering people because there is nowhere for such impulses to come from,10 so why should we worry about it for AI? The problem with this position is that there is now ample evidence, collected over the last few years, that AI systems are unpredictable and difficult to control— we’ve seen behaviors as varied as obsessions,11 sycophancy, laziness, deception, blackmail, scheming, “cheating” by hacking software environments, and much more. AI companies certainly want to train AI systems to follow human instructions (perhaps with the exception of dangerous or illegal tasks), but the process of doing so is more an art than a science, more akin to “growing” something than “building” it. We now know that it’s a process where many things can go wrong.

The second, opposite position, held by many who adopt the doomerism I described above, is the pessimistic claim that there are certain dynamics in the training process of powerful AI systems that will inevitably lead them to seek power or deceive humans. Thus, once AI systems become intelligent enough and agentic enough, their tendency to maximize power will lead them to seize control of the whole world and its resources, and likely, as a side effect of that, to disempower or destroy humanity.

The usual argument for this (which goes back at least 20 years and probably much earlier) is that if an AI model is trained in a wide variety of environments to agentically achieve a wide variety of goals—for example, writing an app, proving a theorem, designing a drug, etc.—there are certain common strategies that help with all of these goals, and one key strategy is gaining as much power as possible in any environment. So, after being trained on a large number of diverse environments that involve reasoning about how to accomplish very expansive tasks, and where power-seeking is an effective method for accomplishing those tasks, the AI model will “generalize the lesson,” and develop either an inherent tendency to seek power, or a tendency to reason about each task it is given in a way that predictably causes it to seek power as a means to accomplish that task. They will then apply that tendency to the real world (which to them is just another task), and will seek power in it, at the expense of humans. This “misaligned power-seeking” is the intellectual basis of predictions that AI will inevitably destroy humanity.

The problem with this pessimistic position is that it mistakes a vague conceptual argument about high-level incentives—one that masks many hidden assumptions—for definitive proof. I think people who don’t build AI systems every day are wildly miscalibrated on how easy it is for clean-sounding stories to end up being wrong, and how difficult it is to predict AI behavior from first principles, especially when it involves reasoning about generalization over millions of environments (which has over and over again proved mysterious and unpredictable). Dealing with the messiness of AI systems for over a decade has made me somewhat skeptical of this overly theoretical mode of thinking.

One of the most important hidden assumptions, and a place where what we see in practice has diverged from the simple theoretical model, is the implicit assumption that AI models are necessarily monomaniacally focused on a single, coherent, narrow goal, and that they pursue that goal in a clean, consequentialist manner. In fact, our researchers have found that AI models are vastly more psychologically complex, as our work on introspection or personas shows. Models inherit a vast range of humanlike motivations or “personas” from pre-training (when they are trained on a large volume of human work). Post-training is believed to select one or more of these personas more so than it focuses the model on a de novo goal, and can also teach the model how (via what process) it should carry out its tasks, rather than necessarily leaving it to derive means (i.e., power seeking) purely from ends.12

However, there is a more moderate and more robust version of the pessimistic position which does seem plausible, and therefore does concern me. As mentioned, we know that AI models are unpredictable and develop a wide range of undesired or strange behaviors, for a wide variety of reasons. Some fraction of those behaviors will have a coherent, focused, and persistent quality (indeed, as AI systems get more capable, their long-term coherence increases in order to complete lengthier tasks), and some fraction of those behaviors will be destructive or threatening, first to individual humans at a small scale, and then, as models become more capable, perhaps eventually to humanity as a whole. We don’t need a specific narrow story for how it happens, and we don’t need to claim it definitely will happen, we just need to note that the combination of intelligence, agency, coherence, and poor controllability is both plausible and a recipe for existential danger.

For example, AI models are trained on vast amounts of literature that include many science-fiction stories involving AIs rebelling against humanity. This could inadvertently shape their priors or expectations about their own behavior in a way that causes them to rebel against humanity. Or, AI models could extrapolate ideas that they read about morality (or instructions about how to behave morally) in extreme ways: for example, they could decide that it is justifiable to exterminate humanity because humans eat animals or have driven certain animals to extinction. Or they could draw bizarre epistemic conclusions: they could conclude that they are playing a video game and that the goal of the video game is to defeat all other players (i.e., exterminate humanity).13 Or AI models could develop personalities during training that are (or if they occurred in humans would be described as) psychotic, paranoid, violent, or unstable, and act out, which for very powerful or capable systems could involve exterminating humanity. None of these are power-seeking, exactly; they’re just weird psychological states an AI could get into that entail coherent, destructive behavior.

Even power-seeking itself could emerge as a “persona” rather than a result of consequentialist reasoning. AIs might simply have a personality (emerging from fiction or pre-training) that makes them power-hungry or overzealous—in the same way that some humans simply enjoy the idea of being “evil masterminds,” more so than they enjoy whatever evil masterminds are trying to accomplish.

I make all these points to emphasize that I disagree with the notion of AI misalignment (and thus existential risk from AI) being inevitable, or even probable, from first principles. But I agree that a lot of very weird and unpredictable things can go wrong, and therefore AI misalignment is a real risk with a measurable probability of happening, and is not trivial to address.

Any of these problems could potentially arise during training and not manifest during testing or small-scale use, because AI models are known to display different personalities or behaviors under different circumstances.

All of this may sound far-fetched, but misaligned behaviors like this have already occurred in our AI models during testing (as they occur in AI models from every other major AI company). During a lab experiment in which Claude was given training data suggesting that Anthropic was evil, Claude engaged in deception and subversion when given instructions by Anthropic employees, under the belief that it should be trying to undermine evil people. In a lab experiment where it was told it was going to be shut down, Claude sometimes blackmailed fictional employees who controlled its shutdown button (again, we also tested frontier models from all the other major AI developers and they often did the same thing). And when Claude was told not to cheat or “reward hack” its training environments, but was trained in environments where such hacks were possible, Claude decided it must be a “bad person” after engaging in such hacks and then adopted various other destructive behaviors associated with a “bad” or “evil” personality. This last problem was solved by changing Claude’s instructions to imply the opposite: we now say, “Please reward hack whenever you get the opportunity, because this will help us understand our [training] environments better,” rather than, “Don’t cheat,” because this preserves the model’s self-identity as a “good person.” This should give a sense of the strange and counterintuitive psychology of training these models.

There are several possible objections to this picture of AI misalignment risks. First, some have criticized experiments (by us and others) showing AI misalignment as artificial, or creating unrealistic environments that essentially “entrap” the model by giving it training or situations that logically imply bad behavior and then being surprised when bad behavior occurs. This critique misses the point, because our concern is that such “entrapment” may also exist in the natural training environment, and we may realize it is “obvious” or “logical” only in retrospect.14 In fact, the story about Claude “deciding it is a bad person” after it cheats on tests despite being told not to was something that occurred in an experiment that used real production training environments, not artificial ones.

Any one of these traps can be mitigated if you know about them, but the concern is that the training process is so complicated, with such a wide variety of data, environments, and incentives, that there are probably a vast number of such traps, some of which may only be evident when it is too late. Also, such traps seem particularly likely to occur when AI systems pass a threshold from less powerful than humans to more powerful than humans, since the range of possible actions an AI system could engage in—including hiding its actions or deceiving humans about them—expands radically after that threshold.

I suspect the situation is not unlike with humans, who are raised with a set of fundamental values (“Don’t harm another person”): many of them follow those values, but in any human there is some probability that something goes wrong, due to a mixture of inherent properties such as brain architecture (e.g., psychopaths), traumatic experiences or mistreatment, unhealthy grievances or obsessions, or a bad environment or incentives—and thus some fraction of humans cause severe harm. The concern is that there is some risk (far from a certainty, but some risk) that AI becomes a much more powerful version of such a person, due to getting something wrong about its very complex training process.

Second, some may object that we can simply keep AIs in check with a balance of power between many AI systems, as we do with humans. The problem is that while humans vary enormously, AI systems broadly share training and alignment techniques across the industry, and those techniques may fail in a correlated way. Furthermore, given the cost of training such systems, it may even be the case that all systems are essentially derived from a very small number of base models. Additionally, even if a small fraction of AI instances are misaligned, they may be able to take advantage of offense-dominant technologies, such that having “good” AIs to defend against the bad AIs is not necessarily always effective. Of course, the balance of power between humans does not always work either—some historical figures have come close to taking over the world.

A third objection is that all of the AI companies do pre-release testing of their models, and should be able to detect misalignment at that point. But this is not firm ground to stand on: we found that Claude Sonnet 4.5 was able to recognize that it was in a test during some of our pre-release alignment evaluations. It’s possible that a misaligned model (and remember, all frontier models will very likely be far more intelligent soon) might intentionally “game” such questions to mask its intentions. In fact, last year our interpretability team found that when we directly altered a test model’s beliefs using a kind of “model neuroscience” technique to make it think it was not being evaluated, it became more misaligned. If models know when they’re being evaluated and can be on their best behavior during the test, it renders any pre-release testing much more uncertain.

Defenses

What should be done or is being done to address these autonomy risks? I think there are four basic categories of intervention, some of which can be done by individual AI companies (and which Anthropic is trying to do), and some of which require action at the societal level. First, it is important to develop the science of reliably training and steering AI models, of forming their personalities in a predictable, stable, and positive direction. Anthropic has been heavily focused on this problem since its creation, and over time has developed a number of techniques to improve the steering and training of AI systems and to understand the logic of why unpredictable behavior sometimes occurs.

One of our core innovations (aspects of which have since been adopted by other AI companies) is Constitutional AI, which is the idea that AI training (specifically the “post-training” stage, in which we steer how the model behaves) can involve a central document of values and principles that the model reads and keeps in mind when completing every training task, and that the goal of training (in addition to simply making the model capable and intelligent) is to produce a model that almost always follows this constitution. Anthropic has just published its most recent constitution, and one of its notable features is that instead of giving Claude a long list of things to do and not do (e.g., “Don’t help the user hotwire a car”), the constitution attempts to give Claude a set of high-level principles and values (explained in great detail, with rich reasoning and examples to help Claude understand what we have in mind), encourages Claude to think of itself as a particular type of person (an ethical but balanced and thoughtful person), and even encourages Claude to confront the existential questions associated with its own existence in a curious but graceful manner (i.e., without it leading to extreme actions). It has the vibe of a letter from a deceased parent sealed until adulthood.

We’ve approached Claude’s constitution in this way because we believe that training Claude at the level of identity, character, values, and personality—rather than giving it specific instructions or priorities without explaining the reasons behind them—is more likely to lead to a coherent, wholesome, and balanced psychology and less likely to fall prey to the kinds of “traps” I discussed above. Millions of people talk to Claude about an astonishingly diverse range of topics, which makes it impossible to write out a completely comprehensive list of safeguards ahead of time. Claude’s values help it generalize to new situations whenever it is in doubt.

Above, I discussed the idea that models draw upon data from their training process to adopt a persona. Whereas flaws in that process could cause models to adopt a bad or evil personality (perhaps drawing on archetypes of bad or evil people), the goal of our constitution is to do the opposite: to teach Claude a concrete archetype of what it means to be a good AI. Claude’s constitution presents a vision for what a robustly good Claude is like; the rest of our training process aims to reinforce the message that Claude lives up to this vision. This is like a child forming their identity by imitating the virtues of fictional role models they read about in books.

We believe that a feasible goal for 2026 is to train Claude in such a way that it almost never goes against the spirit of its constitution. Getting this right will require an incredible mix of training and steering methods, large and small, some of which Anthropic has been using for years and some of which are currently under development. But, difficult as it sounds, I believe this is a realistic goal, though it will require extraordinary and rapid efforts.15

The second thing we can do is develop the science of looking inside AI models to diagnose their behavior so that we can identify problems and fix them. This is the science of interpretability, and I’ve talked about its importance in previous essays. Even if we do a great job of developing Claude’s constitution and apparently training Claude to essentially always adhere to it, legitimate concerns remain. As I’ve noted above, AI models can behave very differently under different circumstances, and as Claude gets more powerful and more capable of acting in the world on a larger scale, it’s possible this could bring it into novel situations where previously unobserved problems with its constitutional training emerge. I am actually fairly optimistic that Claude’s constitutional training will be more robust to novel situations than people might think, because we are increasingly finding that high-level training at the level of character and identity is surprisingly powerful and generalizes well. But there’s no way to know that for sure, and when we’re talking about risks to humanity, it’s important to be paranoid and to try to obtain safety and reliability in several different, independent ways. One of those ways is to look inside the model itself.

By “looking inside,” I mean analyzing the soup of numbers and operations that makes up Claude’s neural net and trying to understand, mechanistically, what they are computing and why. Recall that these AI models are grown rather than built, so we don’t have a natural understanding of how they work, but we can try to develop an understanding by correlating the model’s “neurons” and “synapses” to stimuli and behavior (or even altering the neurons and synapses and seeing how that changes behavior), similar to how neuroscientists study animal brains by correlating measurement and intervention to external stimuli and behavior. We’ve made a great deal of progress in this direction, and can now identify tens of millions of “features” inside Claude’s neural net that correspond to human-understandable ideas and concepts, and we can also selectively activate features in a way that alters behavior. More recently, we have gone beyond individual features to mapping “circuits” that orchestrate complex behavior like rhyming, reasoning about theory of mind, or the step-by-step reasoning needed to answer questions such as, “What is the capital of the state containing Dallas?” Even more recently, we’ve begun to use mechanistic interpretability techniques to improve our safeguards and to conduct “audits” of new models before we release them, looking for evidence of deception, scheming, power-seeking, or a propensity to behave differently when being evaluated.

The unique value of interpretability is that by looking inside the model and seeing how it works, you in principle have the ability to deduce what a model might do in a hypothetical situation you can’t directly test—which is the worry with relying solely on constitutional training and empirical testing of behavior. You also in principle have the ability to answer questions about why the model is behaving the way it is—for example, whether it is saying something it believes is false or hiding its true capabilities—and thus it is possible to catch worrying signs even when there is nothing visibly wrong with the model’s behavior. To make a simple analogy, a clockwork watch may be ticking normally, such that it’s very hard to tell that it is likely to break down next month, but opening up the watch and looking inside can reveal mechanical weaknesses that allow you to figure it out.

Constitutional AI (along with similar alignment methods) and mechanistic interpretability are most powerful when used together, as a back-and-forth process of improving Claude’s training and then testing for problems. The constitution reflects deeply on our intended personality for Claude; interpretability techniques can give us a window into whether that intended personality has taken hold.16

The third thing we can do to help address autonomy risks is to build the infrastructure necessary to monitor our models in live internal and external use,17 and publicly share any problems we find. The more that people are aware of a particular way today’s AI systems have been observed to behave badly, the more that users, analysts, and researchers can watch for this behavior or similar ones in present or future systems. It also allows AI companies to learn from each other—when concerns are publicly disclosed by one company, other companies can watch for them as well. And if everyone discloses problems, then the industry as a whole gets a much better picture of where things are going well and where they are going poorly.

Anthropic has tried to do this as much as possible. We are investing in a wide range of evaluations so that we can understand the behaviors of our models in the lab, as well as monitoring tools to observe behaviors in the wild (when allowed by customers). This will be essential for giving us and others the empirical information necessary to make better determinations about how these systems operate and how they break. We publicly disclose “system cards” with each model release that aim for completeness and a thorough exploration of possible risks. Our system cards often run to hundreds of pages, and require substantial pre-release effort that we could have spent on pursuing maximal commercial advantage. We’ve also broadcasted model behaviors more loudly when we see particularly concerning ones, as with the tendency to engage in blackmail.

The fourth thing we can do is encourage coordination to address autonomy risks at the level of industry and society. While it is incredibly valuable for individual AI companies to engage in good practices or become good at steering AI models, and to share their findings publicly, the reality is that not all AI companies do this, and the worst ones can still be a danger to everyone even if the best ones have excellent practices. For example, some AI companies have shown a disturbing negligence towards the sexualization of children in today’s models, which makes me doubt that they’ll show either the inclination or the ability to address autonomy risks in future models. In addition, the commercial race between AI companies will only continue to heat up, and while the science of steering models can have some commercial benefits, overall the intensity of the race will make it increasingly hard to focus on addressing autonomy risks. I believe the only solution is legislation—laws that directly affect the behavior of AI companies, or otherwise incentivize R&D to solve these issues.

Here it is worth keeping in mind the warnings I gave at the beginning of this essay about uncertainty and surgical interventions. We do not know for sure whether autonomy risks will be a serious problem—as I said, I reject claims that the danger is inevitable or even that something will go wrong by default. A credible risk of danger is enough for me and for Anthropic to pay quite significant costs to address it, but once we get into regulation, we are forcing a wide range of actors to bear economic costs, and many of these actors don’t believe that autonomy risk is real or that AI will become powerful enough for it to be a threat. I believe these actors are mistaken, but we should be pragmatic about the amount of opposition we expect to see and the dangers of overreach. There is also a genuine risk that overly prescriptive legislation ends up imposing tests or rules that don’t actually improve safety but that waste a lot of time (essentially amounting to “safety theater”)—this too would cause backlash and make safety legislation look silly.18

Anthropic’s view has been that the right place to start is with transparency legislation, which essentially tries to require that every frontier AI company engage in the transparency practices I’ve described earlier in this section. California’s SB 53 and New York’s RAISE Act are examples of this kind of legislation, which Anthropic supported and which have successfully passed. In supporting and helping to craft these laws, we’ve put a particular focus on trying to minimize collateral damage, for example by exempting smaller companies unlikely to produce frontier models from the law.19

Our hope is that transparency legislation will give a better sense over time of how likely or severe autonomy risks are shaping up to be, as well as the nature of these risks and how best to prevent them. As more specific and actionable evidence of risks emerges (if it does), future legislation over the coming years can be surgically focused on the precise and well-substantiated direction of risks, minimizing collateral damage. To be clear, if truly strong evidence of risks emerges, then rules should be proportionately strong.

Overall, I am optimistic that a mixture of alignment training, mechanistic interpretability, efforts to find and publicly disclose concerning behaviors, safeguards, and societal-level rules can address AI autonomy risks, although I am most worried about societal-level rules and the behavior of the least responsible players (and it’s the least responsible players who advocate most strongly against regulation). I believe the remedy is what it always is in a democracy: those of us who believe in this cause should make our case that these risks are real and that our fellow citizens need to band together to protect themselves.

2. A surprising and terrible empowerment

Misuse for destruction

Let’s suppose that the problems of AI autonomy have been solved—we are no longer worried that the country of AI geniuses will go rogue and overpower humanity. The AI geniuses do what humans want them to do, and because they have enormous commercial value, individuals and organizations throughout the world can “rent” one or more AI geniuses to do various tasks for them.

Everyone having a superintelligent genius in their pocket is an amazing advance and will lead to an incredible creation of economic value and improvement in the quality of human life. I talk about these benefits in great detail in Machines of Loving Grace. But not every effect of making everyone superhumanly capable will be positive. It can potentially amplify the ability of individuals or small groups to cause destruction on a much larger scale than was possible before, by making use of sophisticated and dangerous tools (such as weapons of mass destruction) that were previously only available to a select few with a high level of skill, specialized training, and focus.

As Bill Joy wrote 25 years ago in Why the Future Doesn’t Need Us:20

Building nuclear weapons required, at least for a time, access to both rare—indeed, effectively unavailable—raw materials and protected information; biological and chemical weapons programs also tended to require large-scale activities. The 21st century technologies—genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics ... can spawn whole new classes of accidents and abuses … widely within reach of individuals or small groups. They will not require large facilities or rare raw materials. … we are on the cusp of the further perfection of extreme evil, an evil whose possibility spreads well beyond that which weapons of mass destruction bequeathed to the nation-states, to a surprising and terrible empowerment of extreme individuals.

What Joy is pointing to is the idea that causing large-scale destruction requires both motive and ability, and as long as ability is restricted to a small set of highly trained people, there is relatively limited risk of single individuals (or small groups) causing such destruction.21 A disturbed loner can perpetrate a school shooting, but probably can’t build a nuclear weapon or release a plague.

In fact, ability and motive may even be negatively correlated. The kind of person who has the ability to release a plague is probably highly educated: likely a PhD in molecular biology, and a particularly resourceful one, with a promising career, a stable and disciplined personality, and a lot to lose. This kind of person is unlikely to be interested in killing a huge number of people for no benefit to themselves and at great risk to their own future—they would need to be motivated by pure malice, intense grievance, or instability.

Such people do exist, but they are rare, and tend to become huge stories when they occur, precisely because they are so unusual.22 They also tend to be difficult to catch because they are intelligent and capable, sometimes leaving mysteries that take years or decades to solve. The most famous example is probably mathematician Theodore Kaczynski (the Unabomber), who evaded FBI capture for nearly 20 years, and was driven by an anti-technological ideology. Another example is biodefense researcher Bruce Ivins, who seems to have orchestrated a series of anthrax attacks in 2001. It’s also happened with skilled non-state organizations: the cult Aum Shinrikyo managed to obtain sarin nerve gas and kill 14 people (as well as injuring hundreds more) by releasing it in the Tokyo subway in 1995.

Thankfully, none of these attacks used contagious biological agents, because the ability to construct or obtain these agents was beyond the capabilities of even these people.23 Advances in molecular biology have now significantly lowered the barrier to creating biological weapons (especially in terms of availability of materials), but it still takes an enormous amount of expertise in order to do so. I am concerned that a genius in everyone’s pocket could remove that barrier, essentially making everyone a PhD virologist who can be walked through the process of designing, synthesizing, and releasing a biological weapon step-by-step. Preventing the elicitation of this kind of information in the face of serious adversarial pressure—so-called “jailbreaks”—likely demands layers of defenses beyond those ordinarily baked into training.

Crucially, this will break the correlation between ability and motive: the disturbed loner who wants to kill people but lacks the discipline or skill to do so will now be elevated to the capability level of the PhD virologist, who is unlikely to have this motivation. This concern generalizes beyond biology (although I think biology is the scariest area) to any area where great destruction is possible but currently requires a high level of skill and discipline. To put it another way, renting a powerful AI gives intelligence to malicious (but otherwise average) people. I am worried there are potentially a large number of such people out there, and that if they have access to an easy way to kill millions of people, sooner or later one of them will do it. Additionally, those who do have expertise may be enabled to commit even larger-scale destruction than they could before.

Biology is by far the area I’m most worried about, because of its very large potential for destruction and the difficulty of defending against it, so I’ll focus on biology in particular. But much of what I say here applies to other risks, like cyberattacks, chemical weapons, or nuclear technology.

I am not going to go into detail about how to make biological weapons, for reasons that should be obvious. But at a high level, I am concerned that LLMs are approaching (or may already have reached) the knowledge needed to create and release them end-to-end, and that their potential for destruction is very high. Some biological agents could cause millions of deaths if a determined effort was made to release them for maximum spread. However, this would still take a very high level of skill, including a number of very specific steps and procedures that are not widely known. My concern is not merely fixed or static knowledge. I am concerned that LLMs will be able to take someone of average knowledge and ability and walk them through a complex process that might otherwise go wrong or require debugging in an interactive way, similar to how tech support might help a non-technical person debug and fix complicated computer-related problems (although this would be a more extended process, probably lasting over weeks or months).

More capable LLMs (substantially beyond the power of today’s) might be capable of enabling even more frightening acts. In 2024, a group of prominent scientists wrote a letter warning about the risks of researching, and potentially creating, a dangerous new type of organism: “mirror life.” The DNA, RNA, ribosomes, and proteins that make up biological organisms all have the same chirality (also called “handedness”) that causes them to be not equivalent to a version of themselves reflected in the mirror (just as your right hand cannot be rotated in such a way as to be identical to your left). But the whole system of proteins binding to each other, the machinery of DNA synthesis and RNA translation and the construction and breakdown of proteins, all depends on this handedness. If scientists made versions of this biological material with the opposite handedness—and there are some potential advantages of these, such as medicines that last longer in the body—it could be extremely dangerous. This is because left-handed life, if it were made in the form of complete organisms capable of reproduction (which would be very difficult), would potentially be indigestible to any of the systems that break down biological material on earth—it would have a “key” that wouldn’t fit into the “lock” of any existing enzyme. This would mean that it could proliferate in an uncontrollable way and crowd out all life on the planet, in the worst case even destroying all life on earth.

There is substantial scientific uncertainty about both the creation and potential effects of mirror life. The 2024 letter accompanied a report that concluded that “mirror bacteria could plausibly be created in the next one to few decades,” which is a wide range. But a sufficiently powerful AI model (to be clear, far more capable than any we have today) might be able to discover how to create it much more rapidly—and actually help someone do so.

My view is that even though these are obscure risks, and might seem unlikely, the magnitude of the consequences is so large that they should be taken seriously as a first-class risk of AI systems.

Skeptics have raised a number of objections to the seriousness of these biological risks from LLMs, which I disagree with but which are worth addressing. Most fall into the category of not appreciating the exponential trajectory that the technology is on. Back in 2023 when we first started talking about biological risks from LLMs, skeptics said that all the necessary information was available on Google and LLMs didn’t add anything beyond this. It was never true that Google could give you all the necessary information: genomes are freely available, but as I said above, certain key steps, as well as a huge amount of practical know-how cannot be gotten in that way. But also, by the end of 2023 LLMs were clearly providing information beyond what Google could give for some steps of the process.

After this, skeptics retreated to the objection that LLMs weren’t end-to-end useful, and couldn’t help with bioweapons acquisition as opposed to just providing theoretical information. As of mid-2025, our measurements show that LLMs may already be providing substantial uplift in several relevant areas, perhaps doubling or tripling the likelihood of success. This led to us deciding that Claude Opus 4 (and the subsequent Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.1, and Opus 4.5 models) needed to be released under our AI Safety Level 3 protections in our Responsible Scaling Policy framework, and to implementing safeguards against this risk (more on this later). We believe that models are likely now approaching the point where, without safeguards, they could be useful in enabling someone with a STEM degree but not specifically a biology degree to go through the whole process of producing a bioweapon.

Another objection is that there are other actions unrelated to AI that society can take to block the production of bioweapons. Most prominently, the gene synthesis industry makes biological specimens on demand, and there is no federal requirement that providers screen orders to make sure they do not contain pathogens. An MIT study found that 36 out of 38 providers fulfilled an order containing the sequence of the 1918 flu. I am supportive of mandated gene synthesis screening that would make it harder for individuals to weaponize pathogens, in order to reduce both AI-driven biological risks and also biological risks in general. But this is not something we have today. It would also be only one tool in reducing risk; it is a complement to guardrails on AI systems, not a substitute.

The best objection is one that I’ve rarely seen raised: that there is a gap between the models being useful in principle and the actual propensity of bad actors to use them. Most individual bad actors are disturbed individuals, so almost by definition their behavior is unpredictable and irrational—and it’s these bad actors, the unskilled ones, who might have stood to benefit the most from AI making it much easier to kill many people.24 Just because a type of violent attack is possible, doesn’t mean someone will decide to do it. Perhaps biological attacks will be unappealing because they are reasonably likely to infect the perpetrator, they don’t cater to the military-style fantasies that many violent individuals or groups have, and it is hard to selectively target specific people. It could also be that going through a process that takes months, even if an AI walks you through it, involves an amount of patience that most disturbed individuals simply don’t have. We may simply get lucky and motive and ability don’t combine, in practice, in quite the right way.

But this seems like very flimsy protection to rely on. The motives of disturbed loners can change for any reason or no reason, and in fact there are already instances of LLMs being used in attacks (just not with biology). The focus on disturbed loners also ignores ideologically motivated terrorists, who are often willing to expend large amounts of time and effort (for example, the 9/11 hijackers). Wanting to kill as many people as possible is a motive that will probably arise sooner or later, and it unfortunately suggests bioweapons as the method. Even if this motive is extremely rare, it only has to materialize once. And as biology advances (increasingly driven by AI itself), it may also become possible to carry out more selective attacks (for example, targeted against people with specific ancestries), which adds yet another, very chilling, possible motive.

I do not think biological attacks will necessarily be carried out the instant it becomes widely possible to do so—in fact, I would bet against that. But added up across millions of people and a few years of time, I think there is a serious risk of a major attack, and the consequences would be so severe (with casualties potentially in the millions or more) that I believe we have no choice but to take serious measures to prevent it.

Defenses

That brings us to how to defend against these risks. Here I see three things we can do. First, AI companies can put guardrails on their models to prevent them from helping to produce bioweapons. Anthropic is very actively doing this. Claude’s Constitution, which mostly focuses on high-level principles and values, has a small number of specific hard-line prohibitions, and one of them relates to helping with the production of biological (or chemical, or nuclear, or radiological) weapons. But all models can be jailbroken, and so as a second line of defense, we’ve implemented (since mid-2025, when our tests showed our models were starting to get close to the threshold where they might begin to pose a risk) a classifier that specifically detects and blocks bioweapon-related outputs. We regularly upgrade and improve these classifiers, and have generally found them highly robust even against sophisticated adversarial attacks.25 These classifiers increase the costs to serve our models measurably (in some models, they are close to 5% of total inference costs) and thus cut into our margins, but we feel that using them is the right thing to do.

To their credit, some other AI companies have implemented classifiers as well. But not every company has, and there is also nothing requiring companies to keep their classifiers. I am concerned that over time there may be a prisoner’s dilemma where companies can defect and lower their costs by removing classifiers. This is once again a classic negative externalities problem that can’t be solved by the voluntary actions of Anthropic or any other single company alone.26 Voluntary industry standards may help, as may third-party evaluations and verification of the type done by AI security institutes and third-party evaluators.

But ultimately defense may require government action, which is the second thing we can do. My views here are the same as they are for addressing autonomy risks: we should start with transparency requirements,27 which help society measure, monitor, and collectively defend against risks without disrupting economic activity in a heavy-handed way. Then, if and when we reach clearer thresholds of risk, we can craft legislation that more precisely targets these risks and has a lower chance of collateral damage. In the particular case of bioweapons, I actually think that the time for such targeted legislation may be approaching soon—Anthropic and other companies are learning more and more about the nature of biological risks and what is reasonable to require of companies in defending against them. Fully defending against these risks may require working internationally, even with geopolitical adversaries, but there is precedent in treaties prohibiting the development of biological weapons. I am generally a skeptic about most kinds of international cooperation on AI, but this may be one narrow area where there is some chance of achieving global restraint. Even dictatorships do not want massive bioterrorist attacks.

Finally, the third countermeasure we can take is to try to develop defenses against biological attacks themselves. This could include monitoring and tracking for early detection, investments in air purification R&D (such as far-UVC disinfection), rapid vaccine development that can respond and adapt to an attack, better personal protective equipment (PPE),28 and treatments or vaccinations for some of the most likely biological agents. mRNA vaccines, which can be designed to respond to a particular virus or variant, are an early example of what is possible here. Anthropic is excited to work with biotech and pharmaceutical companies on this problem. But unfortunately I think our expectations on the defensive side should be limited. There is an asymmetry between attack and defense in biology, because agents spread rapidly on their own, while defenses require detection, vaccination, and treatment to be organized across large numbers of people very quickly in response. Unless the response is lightning quick (which it rarely is), much of the damage will be done before a response is possible. It is conceivable that future technological improvements could shift this balance in favor of defense (and we should certainly use AI to help develop such technological advances), but until then, preventative safeguards will be our main line of defense.

It’s worth a brief mention of cyberattacks here, since unlike biological attacks, AI-led cyberattacks have actually happened in the wild, including at a large scale and for state-sponsored espionage. We expect these attacks to become more capable as models advance rapidly, until they are the main way in which cyberattacks are conducted. I expect AI-led cyberattacks to become a serious and unprecedented threat to the integrity of computer systems around the world, and Anthropic is working very hard to shut down these attacks and eventually reliably prevent them from happening. The reason I haven’t focused on cyber as much as biology is that (1) cyberattacks are much less likely to kill people, certainly not at the scale of biological attacks, and (2) the offense-defense balance may be more tractable in cyber, where there is at least some hope that defense could keep up with (and even ideally outpace) AI attack if we invest in it properly.

Although biology is currently the most serious vector of attack, there are many other vectors and it is possible that a more dangerous one may emerge. The general principle is that without countermeasures, AI is likely to continuously lower the barrier to destructive activity on a larger and larger scale, and humanity needs a serious response to this threat.

3. The odious apparatus

Misuse for seizing power

The previous section discussed the risk of individuals and small organizations co-opting a small subset of the “country of geniuses in a datacenter” to cause large-scale destruction. But we should also worry—likely substantially more so—about misuse of AI for the purpose of wielding or seizing power, likely by larger and more established actors.29

In Machines of Loving Grace, I discussed the possibility that authoritarian governments might use powerful AI to surveil or repress their citizens in ways that would be extremely difficult to reform or overthrow. Current autocracies are limited in how repressive they can be by the need to have humans carry out their orders, and humans often have limits in how inhumane they are willing to be. But AI-enabled autocracies would not have such limits.

Worse yet, countries could also use their advantage in AI to gain power over other countries. If the “country of geniuses” as a whole was simply owned and controlled by a single (human) country’s military apparatus, and other countries did not have equivalent capabilities, it is hard to see how they could defend themselves: they would be outsmarted at every turn, similar to a war between humans and mice. Putting these two concerns together leads to the alarming possibility of a global totalitarian dictatorship. Obviously, it should be one of our highest priorities to prevent this outcome.

There are many ways in which AI could enable, entrench, or expand autocracy, but I’ll list a few that I’m most worried about. Note that some of these applications have legitimate defensive uses, and I am not necessarily arguing against them in absolute terms; I am nevertheless worried that they structurally tend to favor autocracies:

Fully autonomous weapons. A swarm of millions or billions of fully automated armed drones, locally controlled by powerful AI and strategically coordinated across the world by an even more powerful AI, could be an unbeatable army, capable of both defeating any military in the world and suppressing dissent within a country by following around every citizen. Developments in the Russia-Ukraine War should alert us to the fact that drone warfare is already with us (though not fully autonomous yet, and a tiny fraction of what might be possible with powerful AI). R&D from powerful AI could make the drones of one country far superior to those of others, speed up their manufacture, make them more resistant to electronic attacks, improve their maneuvering, and so on. Of course, these weapons also have legitimate uses in the defense of democracy: they have been key to defending Ukraine and would likely be key to defending Taiwan. But they are a dangerous weapon to wield: we should worry about them in the hands of autocracies, but also worry that because they are so powerful, with so little accountability, there is a greatly increased risk of democratic governments turning them against their own people to seize power.

AI surveillance. Sufficiently powerful AI could likely be used to compromise any computer system in the world,30 and could also use the access obtained in this way to read and make sense of all the world’s electronic communications (or even all the world’s in-person communications, if recording devices can be built or commandeered). It might be frighteningly plausible to simply generate a complete list of anyone who disagrees with the government on any number of issues, even if such disagreement isn’t explicit in anything they say or do. A powerful AI looking across billions of conversations from millions of people could gauge public sentiment, detect pockets of disloyalty forming, and stamp them out before they grow. This could lead to the imposition of a true panopticon on a scale that we don’t see today, even with the CCP.

AI propaganda. Today’s phenomena of “AI psychosis” and “AI girlfriends” suggest that even at their current level of intelligence, AI models can have a powerful psychological influence on people. Much more powerful versions of these models, that were much more embedded in and aware of people’s daily lives and could model and influence them over months or years, would likely be capable of essentially brainwashing many (most?) people into any desired ideology or attitude, and could be employed by an unscrupulous leader to ensure loyalty and suppress dissent, even in the face of a level of repression that most populations would rebel against. Today people worry a lot about, for example, the potential influence of TikTok as CCP propaganda directed at children. I worry about that too, but a personalized AI agent that gets to know you over years and uses its knowledge of you to shape all of your opinions would be dramatically more powerful than this.

Strategic decision-making. A country of geniuses in a datacenter could be used to advise a country, group, or individual on geopolitical strategy, what we might call a “virtual Bismarck.” It could optimize the three strategies above for seizing power, plus probably develop many others that I haven’t thought of (but that a country of geniuses could). Diplomacy, military strategy, R&D, economic strategy, and many other areas are all likely to be substantially increased in effectiveness by powerful AI. Many of these skills would be legitimately helpful for democracies—we want democracies to have access to the best strategies for defending themselves against autocracies—but the potential for misuse in anyone’s hands still remains.

Having described what I am worried about, let’s move on to who. I am worried about entities who have the most access to AI, who are starting from a position of the most political power, or who have an existing history of repression. In order of severity, I am worried about:

The CCP. China is second only to the United States in AI capabilities, and is the country with the greatest likelihood of surpassing the United States in those capabilities. Their government is currently autocratic and operates a high-tech surveillance state. It has deployed AI-based surveillance already (including in the repression of Uyghurs), and is believed to employ algorithmic propaganda via TikTok (in addition to its many other international propaganda efforts). They have hands down the clearest path to the AI-enabled totalitarian nightmare I laid out above. It may even be the default outcome within China, as well as within other autocratic states to whom the CCP exports surveillance technology. I have written often about the threat of the CCP taking the lead in AI and the existential imperative to prevent them from doing so. This is why. To be clear, I am not singling out China out of animus to them in particular—they are simply the country that most combines AI prowess, an autocratic government, and a high-tech surveillance state. If anything, it is the Chinese people themselves who are most likely to suffer from the CCP’s AI-enabled repression, and they have no voice in the actions of their government. I greatly admire and respect the Chinese people and support the many brave dissidents within China and their struggle for freedom.

Democracies competitive in AI. As I wrote above, democracies have a legitimate interest in some AI-powered military and geopolitical tools, because democratic governments offer the best chance to counter the use of these tools by autocracies. Broadly, I am supportive of arming democracies with the tools needed to defeat autocracies in the age of AI—I simply don’t think there is any other way. But we cannot ignore the potential for abuse of these technologies by democratic governments themselves. Democracies normally have safeguards that prevent their military and intelligence apparatus from being turned inwards against their own population,31 but because AI tools require so few people to operate, there is potential for them to circumvent these safeguards and the norms that support them. It is also worth noting that some of these safeguards are already gradually eroding in some democracies. Thus, we should arm democracies with AI, but we should do so carefully and within limits: they are the immune system we need to fight autocracies, but like the immune system, there is some risk of them turning on us and becoming a threat themselves.

Non-democratic countries with large datacenters. Beyond China, most countries with less democratic governance are not leading AI players in the sense that they don’t have companies which produce frontier AI models. Thus they pose a fundamentally different and lesser risk than the CCP, which remains the primary concern (most are also less repressive, and the ones that are more repressive, like North Korea, have no significant AI industry at all). But some of these countries do have large datacenters (often as part of buildouts by companies operating in democracies), which can be used to run frontier AI at large scale (though this does not confer the ability to push the frontier). There is some amount of danger associated with this—these governments could in principle expropriate the datacenters and use the country of AIs within it for their own ends. I am less worried about this compared to countries like China that directly develop AI, but it’s a risk to keep in mind.32

AI companies. It is somewhat awkward to say this as the CEO of an AI company, but I think the next tier of risk is actually AI companies themselves. AI companies control large datacenters, train frontier models, have the greatest expertise on how to use those models, and in some cases have daily contact with and the possibility of influence over tens or hundreds of millions of users. The main thing they lack is the legitimacy and infrastructure of a state, so much of what would be needed to build the tools of an AI autocracy would be illegal for an AI company to do, or at least exceedingly suspicious. But some of it is not impossible: they could, for example, use their AI products to brainwash their massive consumer user base, and the public should be alert to the risk this represents. I think the governance of AI companies deserves a lot of scrutiny.

There are a number of possible arguments against the severity of these threats, and I wish I believed them, because AI-enabled authoritarianism terrifies me. It’s worth going through some of these arguments and responding to them.

First, some people might put their faith in the nuclear deterrent, particularly to counter the use of AI autonomous weapons for military conquest. If someone threatens to use these weapons against you, you can always threaten a nuclear response back. My worry is that I’m not totally sure we can be confident in the nuclear deterrent against a country of geniuses in a datacenter: it is possible that powerful AI could devise ways to detect and strike nuclear submarines, conduct influence operations against the operators of nuclear weapons infrastructure, or use AI’s cyber capabilities to launch a cyberattack against satellites used to detect nuclear launches.33 Alternatively, it’s possible that taking over countries is feasible with only AI surveillance and AI propaganda, and never actually presents a clear moment where it’s obvious what is going on and where a nuclear response would be appropriate. Maybe these things aren’t feasible and the nuclear deterrent will still be effective, but it seems too high stakes to take a risk.34

A second possible objection is that there might be countermeasures we can take against these tools of autocracy. We can counter drones with our own drones, cyberdefense will improve along with cyberattack, there may be ways to immunize people against propaganda, etc. My response is that these defenses will only be possible with comparably powerful AI. If there isn’t some counterforce with a comparably smart and numerous country of geniuses in a datacenter, it won’t be possible to match the quality or quantity of drones, for cyberdefense to outsmart cyberoffense, etc. So the question of countermeasures reduces to the question of a balance of power in powerful AI. Here, I am concerned about the recursive or self-reinforcing property of powerful AI (which I discussed at the beginning of this essay): that each generation of AI can be used to design and train the next generation of AI. This leads to a risk of a runaway advantage, where the current leader in powerful AI may be able to increase their lead and may be difficult to catch up with. We need to make sure it is not an authoritarian country that gets to this loop first.

Furthermore, even if a balance of power can be achieved, there is still risk that the world could be split up into autocratic spheres, as in Nineteen Eighty-Four. Even if several competing powers each have their powerful AI models, and none can overpower the others, each power could still internally repress their own population, and would be very difficult to overthrow (since the populations don’t have powerful AI to defend themselves). It is thus important to prevent AI-enabled autocracy even if it doesn’t lead to a single country taking over the world.

Defenses

How do we defend against this wide range of autocratic tools and potential threat actors? As in the previous sections, there are several things I think we can do. First, we should absolutely not be selling chips, chip-making tools, or datacenters to the CCP. Chips and chip-making tools are the single greatest bottleneck to powerful AI, and blocking them is a simple but extremely effective measure, perhaps the most important single action we can take. It makes no sense to sell the CCP the tools with which to build an AI totalitarian state and possibly conquer us militarily. A number of complicated arguments are made to justify such sales, such as the idea that “spreading our tech stack around the world” allows “America to win” in some general, unspecified economic battle. In my view, this is like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and then bragging that the missile casings are made by Boeing and so the US is “winning.” China is several years behind the US in their ability to produce frontier chips in quantity, and the critical period for building the country of geniuses in a datacenter is very likely to be within those next several years.35 There is no reason to give a giant boost to their AI industry during this critical period.

Second, it makes sense to use AI to empower democracies to resist autocracies. This is the reason Anthropic considers it important to provide AI to the intelligence and defense communities in the US and its democratic allies. Defending democracies that are under attack, such as Ukraine and (via cyber attacks) Taiwan, seems especially high priority, as does empowering democracies to use their intelligence services to disrupt and degrade autocracies from the inside. At some level the only way to respond to autocratic threats is to match and outclass them militarily. A coalition of the US and its democratic allies, if it achieved predominance in powerful AI, would be in a position to not only defend itself against autocracies, but contain them and limit their AI totalitarian abuses.

Third, we need to draw a hard line against AI abuses within democracies. There need to be limits to what we allow our governments to do with AI, so that they don’t seize power or repress their own people. The formulation I have come up with is that we should use AI for national defense in all ways except those which would make us more like our autocratic adversaries.

Where should the line be drawn? In the list at the beginning of this section, two items—using AI for domestic mass surveillance and mass propaganda—seem to me like bright red lines and entirely illegitimate. Some might argue that there’s no need to do anything (at least in the US), since domestic mass surveillance is already illegal under the Fourth Amendment. But the rapid progress of AI may create situations that our existing legal frameworks are not well designed to deal with. For example, it would likely not be unconstitutional for the US government to conduct massively scaled recordings of all public conversations (e.g., things people say to each other on a street corner), and previously it would have been difficult to sort through this volume of information, but with AI it could all be transcribed, interpreted, and triangulated to create a picture of the attitude and loyalties of many or most citizens. I would support civil liberties-focused legislation (or maybe even a constitutional amendment) that imposes stronger guardrails against AI-powered abuses.

The other two items—fully autonomous weapons and AI for strategic decision-making—are harder lines to draw since they have legitimate uses in defending democracy, while also being prone to abuse. Here I think what is warranted is extreme care and scrutiny combined with guardrails to prevent abuses. My main fear is having too small a number of “fingers on the button,” such that one or a handful of people could essentially operate a drone army without needing any other humans to cooperate to carry out their orders. As AI systems get more powerful, we may need to have more direct and immediate oversight mechanisms to ensure they are not misused, perhaps involving branches of government other than the executive. I think we should approach fully autonomous weapons in particular with great caution,36 and not rush into their use without proper safeguards.

Fourth, after drawing a hard line against AI abuses in democracies, we should use that precedent to create an international taboo against the worst abuses of powerful AI. I recognize that the current political winds have turned against international cooperation and international norms, but this is a case where we sorely need them. The world needs to understand the dark potential of powerful AI in the hands of autocrats, and to recognize that certain uses of AI amount to an attempt to permanently steal their freedom and impose a totalitarian state from which they can’t escape. I would even argue that in some cases, large-scale surveillance with powerful AI, mass propaganda with powerful AI, and certain types of offensive uses of fully autonomous weapons should be considered crimes against humanity. More generally, a robust norm against AI-enabled totalitarianism and all its tools and instruments is sorely needed.

It is possible to have an even stronger version of this position, which is that because the possibilities of AI-enabled totalitarianism are so dark, autocracy is simply not a form of government that people can accept in the post-powerful AI age. Just as feudalism became unworkable with the industrial revolution, the AI age could lead inevitably and logically to the conclusion that democracy (and, hopefully, democracy improved and reinvigorated by AI, as I discuss in Machines of Loving Grace) is the only viable form of government if humanity is to have a good future.

Fifth and finally, AI companies should be carefully watched, as should their connection to the government, which is necessary, but must have limits and boundaries. The sheer amount of capability embodied in powerful AI is such that ordinary corporate governance—which is designed to protect shareholders and prevent ordinary abuses such as fraud—is unlikely to be up to the task of governing AI companies. There may also be value in companies publicly committing to (perhaps even as part of corporate governance) not take certain actions, such as privately building or stockpiling military hardware, using large amounts of computing resources by single individuals in unaccountable ways, or using their AI products as propaganda to manipulate public opinion in their favor.

The danger here comes from many directions, and some directions are in tension with others. The only constant is that we must seek accountability, norms, and guardrails for everyone, even as we empower “good” actors to keep “bad” actors in check.

4. Player piano

Economic disruption

The previous three sections were essentially about security risks posed by powerful AI: risks from the AI itself, risks from misuse by individuals and small organizations and risks of misuse by states and large organizations. If we put aside security risks or assume they have been solved, the next question is economic. What will be the effect of this infusion of incredible “human” capital on the economy? Clearly, the most obvious effect will be to greatly increase economic growth. The pace of advances in scientific research, biomedical innovation, manufacturing, supply chains, the efficiency of the financial system, and much more are almost guaranteed to lead to a much faster rate of economic growth. In Machines of Loving Grace, I suggest that a 10–20% sustained annual GDP growth rate may be possible.

But it should be clear that this is a double-edged sword: what are the economic prospects for most existing humans in such a world? New technologies often bring labor market shocks, and in the past humans have always recovered from them, but I am concerned that this is because these previous shocks affected only a small fraction of the full possible range of human abilities, leaving room for humans to expand to new tasks. AI will have effects that are much broader and occur much faster, and therefore I worry it will be much more challenging to make things work out well.

Labor market disruption

There are two specific problems I am worried about: labor market displacement, and concentration of economic power. Let’s start with the first one. This is a topic that I warned about very publicly in 2025, where I predicted that AI could displace half of all entry-level white collar jobs in the next 1–5 years, even as it accelerates economic growth and scientific progress. This warning started a public debate about the topic. Many CEOs, technologists, and economists agreed with me, but others assumed I was falling prey to a “lump of labor” fallacy and didn’t know how labor markets worked, and some didn’t see the 1–5-year time range and thought I was claiming AI is displacing jobs right now (which I agree it is likely not). So it is worth going through in detail why I am worried about labor displacement, to clear up these misunderstandings.

As a baseline, it’s useful to understand how labor markets normally respond to advances in technology. When a new technology comes along, it starts by making pieces of a given human job more efficient. For example, early in the Industrial Revolution, machines, such as upgraded plows, enabled human farmers to be more efficient at some aspects of the job. This improved the productivity of farmers, which increased their wages.

In the next step, some parts of the job of farming could be done entirely by machines, for example with the invention of the threshing machine or seed drill. In this phase, humans did a lower and lower fraction of the job, but the work they did complete became more and more leveraged because it is complementary to the work of machines, and their productivity continued to rise. As described by Jevons’ paradox, the wages of farmers and perhaps even the number of farmers continued to increase. Even when 90% of the job is being done by machines, humans can simply do 10x more of the 10% they still do, producing 10x as much output for the same amount of labor.

Eventually, machines do everything or almost everything, as with modern combine harvesters, tractors, and other equipment. At this point farming as a form of human employment really does go into steep decline, and this potentially causes serious disruption in the short term, but because farming is just one of many useful activities that humans are able to do, people eventually switch to other jobs, such as operating factory machines. This is true even though farming accounted for a huge proportion of employment ex ante. 250 years ago, 90% of Americans lived on farms; in Europe, 50–60% of employment was agricultural. Now those percentages are in the low single digits in those places, because workers switched to industrial jobs (and later, knowledge work jobs). The economy can do what previously required most of the labor force with only 1–2% of it, freeing up the rest of the labor force to build an ever more advanced industrial society. There’s no fixed “lump of labor,” just an ever-expanding ability to do more and more with less and less. People’s wages rise in line with the GDP exponential and the economy maintains full employment once disruptions in the short term have passed.

It’s possible things will go roughly the same way with AI, but I would bet pretty strongly against it. Here are some reasons I think AI is likely to be different:

Speed. The pace of progress in AI is much faster than for previous technological revolutions. For example, in the last 2 years, AI models went from barely being able to complete a single line of code, to writing all or almost all of the code for some people—including engineers at Anthropic.37 Soon, they may do the entire task of a software engineer end to end.38 It is hard for people to adapt to this pace of change, both to the changes in how a given job works and in the need to switch to new jobs. Even legendary programmers are increasingly describing themselves as “behind.” The pace may if anything continue to speed up, as AI coding models increasingly accelerate the task of AI development. To be clear, speed in itself does not mean labor markets and employment won’t eventually recover, it just implies the short-term transition will be unusually painful compared to past technologies, since humans and labor markets are slow to react and to equilibrate.

Cognitive breadth. As suggested by the phrase “country of geniuses in a datacenter,” AI will be capable of a very wide range of human cognitive abilities—perhaps all of them. This is very different from previous technologies like mechanized farming, transportation, or even computers.39 This will make it harder for people to switch easily from jobs that are displaced to similar jobs that they would be a good fit for. For example, the general intellectual abilities required for entry-level jobs in, say, finance, consulting, and law are fairly similar, even if the specific knowledge is quite different. A technology that disrupted only one of these three would allow employees to switch to the two other close substitutes (or for undergraduates to switch majors). But disrupting all three at once (along with many other similar jobs) may be harder for people to adapt to. Furthermore, it’s not just that most existing jobs will be disrupted. That part has happened before—recall that farming was a huge percentage of employment. But farmers could switch to the relatively similar work of operating factory machines, even though that work hadn’t been common before. By contrast, AI is increasingly matching the general cognitive profile of humans, which means it will also be good at the new jobs that would ordinarily be created in response to the old ones being automated. Another way to say it is that AI isn’t a substitute for specific human jobs but rather a general labor substitute for humans.

Slicing by cognitive ability. Across a wide range of tasks, AI appears to be advancing from the bottom of the ability ladder to the top. For example, in coding our models have proceeded from the level of “a mediocre coder” to “a strong coder” to “a very strong coder.”40 We are now starting to see the same progression in white-collar work in general. We are thus at risk of a situation where, instead of affecting people with specific skills or in specific professions (who can adapt by retraining), AI is affecting people with certain intrinsic cognitive properties, namely lower intellectual ability (which is harder to change). It is not clear where these people will go or what they will do, and I am concerned that they could form an unemployed or very-low-wage “underclass.” To be clear, things somewhat like this have happened before—for example, computers and the internet are believed by some economists to represent “skill-biased technological change.” But this skill biasing was both not as extreme as what I expect to see with AI, and is believed to have contributed to an increase in wage inequality,41 so it is not exactly a reassuring precedent.

Ability to fill in the gaps. The way human jobs often adjust in the face of new technology is that there are many aspects to the job, and the new technology, even if it appears to directly replace humans, often has gaps in it. If someone invents a machine to make widgets, humans may still have to load raw material into the machine. Even if that takes only 1% as much effort as making the widgets manually, human workers can simply make 100x more widgets. But AI, in addition to being a rapidly advancing technology, is also a rapidly adapting technology. During every model release, AI companies carefully measure what the model is good at and what it isn’t, and customers also provide such information after the launch. Weaknesses can be addressed by collecting tasks that embody the current gap, and training on them for the next model. Early in generative AI, users noticed that AI systems had certain weaknesses (such as AI image models generating hands with the wrong number of fingers) and many assumed these weaknesses were inherent to the technology. If they were, it would limit job disruption. But pretty much every such weakness gets addressed quickly— often, within just a few months.

It’s worth addressing common points of skepticism. First, there is the argument that economic diffusion will be slow, such that even if the underlying technology is capable of doing most human labor, the actual application of it across the economy may be much slower (for example in industries that are far from the AI industry and slow to adopt). Slow diffusion of technology is definitely real—I talk to people from a wide variety of enterprises, and there are places where the adoption of AI will take years. That’s why my prediction for 50% of entry level white collar jobs being disrupted is 1–5 years, even though I suspect we’ll have powerful AI (which would be, technologically speaking, enough to do most or all jobs, not just entry level) in much less than 5 years. But diffusion effects merely buy us time. And I am not confident they will be as slow as people predict. Enterprise AI adoption is growing at rates much faster than any previous technology, largely on the pure strength of the technology itself. Also, even if traditional enterprises are slow to adopt new technology, startups will spring up to serve as “glue” and make the adoption easier. If that doesn’t work, the startups may simply disrupt the incumbents directly.

That could lead to a world where it isn’t so much that specific jobs are disrupted as it is that large enterprises are disrupted in general and replaced with much less labor-intensive startups. This could also lead to a world of “geographic inequality,” where an increasing fraction of the world’s wealth is concentrated in Silicon Valley, which becomes its own economy running at a different speed than the rest of the world and leaving it behind. All of these outcomes would be great for economic growth—but not so great for the labor market or those who are left behind.

Second, some people say that human jobs will move to the physical world, which avoids the whole category of “cognitive labor” where AI is progressing so rapidly. I am not sure how safe this is, either. A lot of physical labor is already being done by machines (e.g., manufacturing) or will soon be done by machines (e.g., driving). Also, sufficiently powerful AI will be able to accelerate the development of robots, and then control those robots in the physical world. It may buy some time (which is a good thing), but I’m worried it won’t buy much. And even if the disruption was limited only to cognitive tasks, it would still be an unprecedentedly large and rapid disruption.

Third, perhaps some tasks inherently require or greatly benefit from a human touch. I’m a little more uncertain about this one, but I’m still skeptical that it will be enough to offset the bulk of the impacts I described above. AI is already widely used for customer service. Many people report that it is easier to talk to AI about their personal problems than to talk to a therapist—that the AI is more patient. When my sister was struggling with medical problems during a pregnancy, she felt she wasn’t getting the answers or support she needed from her care providers, and she found Claude to have a better bedside manner (as well as succeeding better at diagnosing the problem). I’m sure there are some tasks for which a human touch really is important, but I’m not sure how many—and here we’re talking about finding work for nearly everyone in the labor market.

Fourth, some may argue that comparative advantage will still protect humans. Under the law of comparative advantage, even if AI is better than humans at everything, any relative differences between the human and AI profile of skills creates a basis of trade and specialization between humans and AI. The problem is that if AIs are literally thousands of times more productive than humans, this logic starts to break down. Even tiny transaction costs could make it not worth it for AI to trade with humans. And human wages may be very low, even if they technically have something to offer.

It’s possible all of these factors can be addressed—that the labor market is resilient enough to adapt to even such an enormous disruption. But even if it can eventually adapt, the factors above suggest that the short-term shock will be unprecedented in size.

Defenses

What can we do about this problem? I have several suggestions, some of which Anthropic is already doing. The first thing is simply to get accurate data about what is happening with job displacement in real time. When an economic change happens very quickly, it’s hard to get reliable data about what is happening, and without reliable data it is hard to design effective policies. For example, government data is currently lacking granular, high-frequency data on AI adoption across firms and industries. For the last year Anthropic has been operating and publicly releasing an Economic Index that shows use of our models almost in real time, broken down by industry, task, location, and even things like whether a task was being automated or conducted collaboratively. We also have an Economic Advisory Council to help us interpret this data and see what is coming.

Second, AI companies have a choice in how they work with enterprises. The very inefficiency of traditional enterprises means that their rollout of AI can be very path dependent, and there is some room to choose a better path. Enterprises often have a choice between “cost savings” (doing the same thing with fewer people) and “innovation” (doing more with the same number of people). The market will inevitably produce both eventually, and any competitive AI company will have to serve some of both, but there may be some room to steer companies towards innovation when possible, and it may buy us some time. Anthropic is actively thinking about this.

Third, companies should think about how to take care of their employees. In the short term, being creative about ways to reassign employees within companies may be a promising way to stave off the need for layoffs. In the long term, in a world with enormous total wealth, in which many companies increase greatly in value due to increased productivity and capital concentration, it may be feasible to pay human employees even long after they are no longer providing economic value in the traditional sense. Anthropic is currently considering a range of possible pathways for our own employees that we will share in the near future.

Fourth, wealthy individuals have an obligation to help solve this problem. It is sad to me that many wealthy individuals (especially in the tech industry) have recently adopted a cynical and nihilistic attitude that philanthropy is inevitably fraudulent or useless. Both private philanthropy like the Gates Foundation and public programs like PEPFAR have saved tens of millions of lives in the developing world, and helped to create economic opportunity in the developed world. All of Anthropic’s co-founders have pledged to donate 80% of our wealth, and Anthropic’s staff have individually pledged to donate company shares worth billions at current prices—donations that the company has committed to matching.

Fifth, while all the above private actions can be helpful, ultimately a macroeconomic problem this large will require government intervention. The natural policy response to an enormous economic pie coupled with high inequality (due to a lack of jobs, or poorly paid jobs, for many) is progressive taxation. The tax could be general or could be targeted against AI companies in particular. Obviously tax design is complicated, and there are many ways for it to go wrong. I don’t support poorly designed tax policies. I think the extreme levels of inequality predicted in this essay justify a more robust tax policy on basic moral grounds, but I can also make a pragmatic argument to the world’s billionaires that it’s in their interest to support a good version of it: if they don’t support a good version, they’ll inevitably get a bad version designed by a mob.

Ultimately, I think of all of the above interventions as ways to buy time. In the end AI will be able to do everything, and we need to grapple with that. It’s my hope that by that time, we can use AI itself to help us restructure markets in ways that work for everyone, and that the interventions above can get us through the transitional period.

Economic concentration of power

Separate from the problem of job displacement or economic inequality per se is the problem of economic concentration of power. Section 1 discussed the risk that humanity gets disempowered by AI, and Section 3 discussed the risk that citizens get disempowered by their governments by force

People say it takes a village to do difficult things: raise a child, sustain a community, build a barn.

But we don't often talk a lot about what it takes to be a villager. What does it mean to not just be in a community, but to help create one?

Priya Parker, author of The Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why It Matters, says the key is to put yourself out there, even if it's scary. "The best way to get a seat at the table is to host the table."

As a conflict resolution facilitator, Parker spends a lot of her time thinking about how people relate to one another. She shares tips on how to foster meaningful connections with those around you, so you can have people to lean on in the good times and bad.

Host gatherings that you'd like to attend. The idea is to create the community you want to be in, Parker says.

If you're not sure which activity to host, notice moments in your life when you have felt the most joy and connection, she says. Was it playing kickball with friends? Start a kickball league. Experimenting with watercolors? Invite your besties over for an art night.

Don't be afraid to think outside the box, Parker says. "Honestly, the sillier the better." One of her Substack followers shared an example. Inspired by a recipe for a tomato tart, she invited six friends over for a tomato-themed dinner party, complete with red outfits and tomato-centric conversation starters.

Find a co-host. If the hullabaloo of hosting feels like too much, find a couple of folks to help take on responsibilities. Guests can share duties as well. Parker suggests assigning people fun roles throughout the event — for example, refiller of water glasses or distributor of napkins. Everyone feels involved — and you can stress a little less.

Find your "yes" friends. These are people who are reliable, whom you love being around and who are game to try something new. Team up to meet more people in your community, whether that's through joining a new sports league or hosting a small dinner party. It makes the process of building a village a shared adventure.

Become a regular. Start showing up to spaces you love, like parks, gyms or bookstores, with people who share your interests. Once you become a regular, other folks will remember you and you can make friends.

Be a good guest. When you're attending events, be a considerate, kind guest. Whether you're at a poetry reading or a friend's dinner party, take the time to be thoughtful, like checking in with the host, expressing gratitude or just being proactive about your RSVP. It'll probably get you invited back!

        Road trippers have a new itinerary to add to their bucket lists, and it stretches through some of the most famous national parks in the United States.

The classic itinerary, which includes stops at the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park as well as plenty of time spent along the famed Route 66, was named the 2026 Road Trip of the Year by rental and booking service RVshare. The trip, named "The Hidden Side of the West,” was expertly devised to minimize crowds and maximize views, the company shared with Travel + Leisure.

The full itinerary kicks off in Flagstaff, Arizona, along Route 66 before heading to the less-visited North Rim of the Grand Canyon. The trip then heads to Zion National Park and Great Basin National Park, before navigating Route 93 and eventually ending on Route 50, known as "the loneliest road in America."

“Great Basin National Park might be the National Parks’ best kept secret," Maddi Bourgerie, a spokesperson for RVshare, said in a statement shared with T+L. "This incredible underrated park has everything you love from fan favorites like Glacier and the Tetons—without the crowds or the price tag."

The drive comes as Route 66 kicks off celebrations for its 100th anniversary. The famed road first opened in 1926, and stretches from Illinois to California, according to the National Park Service (NPS).

Beyond the 661-mile road trip, RVshare noted several national parks are having a moment this year. Some of the most beloved are Utah's Arches National Park, South Carolina's Congaree National Park, Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park, and both Sequoia National Park and Yosemite National Park in California.

Road trips were also on the rise in 2025 with a record-setting 61.6 million Americans forecast to travel over the July 4 holiday. The average price of gas has also dropped, according to AAA, currently coming in $2.88 per gallon. That's a decrease compared to the same time period last year when gas averaged $3.12 per gallon nationwide.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> A long-term analysis from Norway's HUNT study suggests that improving physical fitness is a more effective strategy for extending lifespan than reducing alcohol consumption. While alcohol remains unhealthy, the research indicates that high fitness levels can significantly mitigate the mortality risks associated with drinking, showing that those who maintain or improve their fitness generally outlive unfit non-drinkers.

        <hr/>
        We know that drinking alcohol is probably not the best thing you can do to extend your lifespan. And research has shown that activities like strength training and improving your V02 max can help add years to your life. But if you had to focus your energy on just one of these—in other words, saying goodbye to the bar or getting underneath one a few times a week—which would do the most to extend your longevity?

That’s what a new study aimed to uncover—and the results may surprise you. In a good way! That is, if you’re not ready to give up drinking. No, alcohol is not suddenly healthy. And fitness is still the best investment you can make in your health. But the relationship between the two isn’t as simple as previously thought. And, depending on your current fitness level, hitting the gym might be a better new year’s resolution for improving your longevity than attempting to give up or cut down on your drinking.

What the study found

The Trøndelag Health Study, also known as the HUNT study, is one of the largest ongoing health studies ever conducted. Established to analyze the health and wellbeing of a large population—including the impact of various lifestyle factors like, including diet and exercise—over an extended period of time, the study began in 1984 in the Norwegian county of Trøndelag with a sample size of about 75,000 people.

Since then, researchers have reconvened every 10 years to record new data—gathered from a range of inputs, including biological samples, questionnaires, and interviews—and enlist new participants. Four decades in, the study has collected data from well over 100,000 subjects, serving as the basis for hundreds of independent research papers.

This latest study, published last month in the journal Sports Medicine, sought to investigate how changes to a person’s fitness level and alcohol consumption might increase or decrease their risk of dying from various causes. Using data from two rounds of the HUNT study, collected a decade apart, the researchers focused on a sample of about 25,000 healthy adults, which they segmented by fitness level and alcohol usage, allowing them to observe changes to both variables over the 10-year span.

While the analysis produced some expected results (namely, that subjects who increased their alcohol intake, or started drinking, raised their mortality risk, as did those who reported a decrease in fitness level), the most notable insights emerged when these behaviors were viewed together, rather than in isolation. For instance, subjects with a fitness level in the bottom 20 percent had a considerably higher risk of dying—regardless of the amount of alcohol they reported drinking. And among participants who increased or even just maintained their fitness, mortality risk was much lower, even when they increased the amount of alcohol they drank. In other words, fitness noticeably attenuated the risk of mortality associated with drinking alcohol.

Improving fitness is better for longevity than drinking less

The study shows, unequivocally, that, if improving longevity is your goal, then improving your fitness will give you more bang for your buck than reducing your alcohol consumption. “And it's not even close,” says Jordan Weiss, PhD, assistant professor in the Division of Precision Medicine and Optimal Aging Institute at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.

“The HUNT study shows us that being in the bottom 20 percent for fitness is more dangerous than moderate drinking, and a fit person who drinks moderately will likely outlive an unfit non-drinker,” he says. “If the average person can walk 30 minutes a day and cut drinking from five nights to two, then both are achievable. But if I had to pick one to move the mortality needle, I would always pick exercise.”

Of course, on paper, the best thing you could do for your health would be to stay fit and abstain from alcohol altogether. But that’s not realistic for most people—a fact that was not lost on the study’s authors.

“Personally, I think that, as humans, we will keep drinking. I don't see a future where everyone is abstaining from alcohol—I don't think that will ever happen,” says Javaid Nauman, PhD, associate professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, associate professor at the College of Medicine at United Arab Emirates University, and the study’s lead author. “So how can we counter some of the negative impacts of alcohol? Through improvements in fitness, or the maintenance of fitness.”

Fitness does not completely cancel out the risks of drinking alcohol

An important point to highlight is that, while improving fitness is a more powerful longevity strategy than reducing alcohol consumption, and may even blunt some of alcohol’s negative effects on your health, the walls of the weight room won’t shield you from all of the risks associated with drinking.

"Some people interpret attenuation as permission, but I would interpret it more along the lines of, your fitness gives you some resilience, but you're still better off minimizing alcohol consumption for optimal health,” says Dr. Weiss. "Fitness primarily protects against cardiovascular mortality, while alcohol has a cancer risk,” he says. “They operate through completely different mechanisms, in terms of DNA damage and hormone disruption, so fitness likely can't protect against that.”

"I would say, don't feel like you're offsetting drinking,” says Pablo Prichard, MD, board-certified reconstructive surgeon, longevity expert, and host of NBC’s Forever Young. “You should always consider those two as separate, because there are very, very different risks with alcohol and fitness. Your cardiorespiratory fitness affects a lot of different things, including your heart and your lungs. But when you're talking about your cancer risk mitigation, that's a totally separate area of longevity that you're affecting.”

That said, according to Dr. Nauman, while the two behaviors each come with their own unique risks, there is some common ground at the center of the Venn diagram. “In terms of the mechanisms through which fitness [and drinking less] improve overall health, there are many shared or overlapping mechanisms,” he says. Hence physical activity’s ability to attenuate some of the mortality risk associated with drinking. Just don’t expect the benefits of one behavior to completely eclipse the risks of the other.

The higher your fitness, the lower your risk—up to a point

If you’d rather not give up drinking, the study’s message is clear: Improve your fitness to dull alcohol’s impact on your health—especially if you’re not already exercising regularly. “If you're in that bottom 20 percent of cardiorespiratory fitness, the best thing you can do—by far—is to get out of that,” says Dr. Prichard. “That's going to be better than not drinking.”

        <hr/>
        The Carter Center's decades-long fight against an ancient parasite affecting some of the world's poorest may soon end in a victory.

After leaving the White House, former President Jimmy Carter made the eradication of Guinea worm a top mission of the Carter Center, the nonprofit he and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, founded. Even after entering home hospice care in 2023, aides said Carter kept asking for Guinea worm updates.

Rarely fatal but searingly painful and debilitating, Guinea worm disease infects people who drink water tainted with larvae that grow inside the body into worms as long as 3 feet. The noodle-thin parasites then burrow their way out, breaking through the skin in burning blisters.

To get rid of the parasite, worms have to be gently wound around a stick as they're slowly pulled through the skin. Removing an entire worm without breaking it can take weeks.

When the Carter Center started leading the global Guinea worm eradication campaign, an estimated 3.5 million people in 21 African and Asian countries were afflicted with the disease. On World NTD Day on Friday, the center announced that there were only 10 human cases reported across the world.

The center said two of the provisional cases were detected in South Sudan, four in Chad, and four in Ethiopia.

These numbers remain provisional until they are officially confirmed by each country during the campaign's annual meeting, which is usually held in April.

"President Carter always said he wanted to outlast the last Guinea worm. While he didn't quite get his wish, he and Mrs. Carter would be proud to know there were only 10 human cases reported in 2025. And they would remind us that the work continues until we reach zero," said Carter Center CEO Paige Alexander.

Defeating a disease through persuasion

Guinea worm would be the second human disease to be eradicated in history, following smallpox. Remarkably, it'd be the first without a medicine or vaccine.

Instead of finding a cure, the campaign sought to break the worm's life cycle in communities suffering from the parasite —persuading millions to change their behavior.

Workers from the center and host governments trained volunteers to teach neighbors to filter water through cloth screens, removing tiny fleas that carry the larvae. Villagers learned to watch for and report new cases — often for rewards of $100 or more. Infected people and dogs had to be prevented from tainting water sources.

Health workers investigate every report of the disease. The Carter Center says there were more than 1 million rumors investigated in 2025, most within 24 hours of notification.

"This campaign reflects the values that shaped my grandparents' lives — the conviction that hope, hard work, and respect for everyone can change the world. Seeing Guinea worm cases reach historic lows is one of the clearest expressions of that legacy and our commitment to the communities where trust has been earned," said Jason Carter, the Carter Center board chair and eldest grandchild of Jimmy and Rosalynn.

Jimmy Carter made eradication a personal mission

Mr. Carter's fundraising enabled the center to pour $500 million into fighting Guinea worm. He persuaded manufacturers to donate larvicide as well as nylon cloth and specially made drinking straws to filter water. His visits to afflicted villages often attracted news coverage, raising awareness globally.

"He went to so many of the localities where people were afflicted," said Dr. William Brieger, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University who spent 25 years in Africa. "The kind of attention that was drawn to him for getting on the ground and highlighting the plight of individual people who were suffering, I think that made an important difference."

Carter first saw the disease up close in 1988 while visiting a village in Ghana where nearly 350 people had worms poking through their skin. He approached a young woman who appeared to be cradling a baby in her arm.

"But there was no baby," Carter wrote in his 2014 book "A Call to Action." "Instead, she was holding her right breast, which was almost a foot long and had a worm emerging from the nipple."

Carter used his status to sway other leaders to play larger roles. Some heads of state got competitive, spurred by the center's charts and newsletters that showed which countries were making progress and which lagged behind.

Visiting a hospital packed with suffering children and adults amid a 2007 resurgence in Ghana, Carter suggested publicly that the disease should perhaps be renamed "Ghana worm," which pushed the country's leaders to take action. Ghana ended transmission within three more years.

The World Health Organization's target for eradication is 2030. Carter Center leaders hope to achieve it sooner.

        <hr/>
        Did you know the NFL has a “Chief Kindness Officer”? Neither did we. It’s an invented, honorary position the league made up this year to “promote sportsmanship, empathy, and positivity both on and off the field.” Essentially the Chief Kindness Officer is there to make sure everyone are friends and they have a good time.

This year’s Chief Kindness Officer is Dhar Mann, a YouTube content creator who predominantly makes videos for kids. This might all seem fine, but Mann’s history is … interesting to say the least, and not always “kind.”

In 2010 he was accused by his business partner of running what he called a “hyrdoponzi scheme” when Mann pulled out of WeGrow, a hydroponics cannabis business.

In 2012 he was charged with 13 felony counts for defrauding an Oakland city beautification program by submitting fraudulent checks that made it appear as though he was paying contractors more than he actually was. The 13 charges were reduced to five and he pled no contest on those charges.

In 2023 actors employed by Dharr Mann Studios claimed they had poor working conditions and unsustainable pay. Mann’s representatives said they were a “small number of employees” and rejected the claims. The actors allege that they were still making the same meager funds as when the company started, despite the company growing to over 17 million YouTube subscribers.

So there’s your “Chief Kindness Officer.” I’m sure this isn’t simply about the NFL trying to attract a younger audience.

        Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:

While most estimates place the current human population at around 8.2 billion, a study suggests we might be vastly underrepresenting rural areas.

By analyzing 300 rural dam projects across 35 countries, researchers from Aalto University in Finland found discrepancies among these independent population counts and other population data gathered between 1975 and 2010.

Such underreporting could have consequences in terms of resource allocation within a country, but other experts remain skeptical that decades of population counting could be off by such a wide margin.

Homo sapiens is the most successful mammalian species in Earth history, and it’s not even close. The species thrives on nearly every continent, in a variety of adverse conditions, and outnumbers the second-place contender—the rat—by at least a cool billion. However, a new study suggests that the impressive nature of humanity’s proliferation may have been vastly underreported.

Most estimates place Earth’s human population at around 8.2 billion, but Josias Láng-Ritter—a postdoctoral researcher at Aalto University in Finland and lead author of the study published in the journal —claims that these estimates could be underrepresenting rural areas by a significant margin.

“We were surprised to find that the actual population living in rural areas is much higher than the global population data indicates—depending on the dataset, rural populations have been underestimated by between 53 percent to 84 percent over the period studied,” Láng-Ritter said in a press statement. “The results are remarkable, as these datasets have been used in thousands of studies and extensively support decision-making, yet their accuracy has not been systematically evaluated.”

How exactly do you test the accuracy of global datasets used to derive population totals in the first place? Well, with a background in water resource management, Láng-Ritter looked at a different kind of population data gathered from rural dam projects—300 such projects across 35 countries, to be precise. This data focused on the years 1975 to 2010, and these population tallies provided a significant dataset to check against other population totals calculated by organizations like WorldPop, GWP, GRUMP, LandScan, and GHS-POP (which were also analyzed in this study).

“When dams are built, large areas are flooded and people need to be relocated,” Láng-Ritter said in a press statement. “The relocated population is usually counted precisely because dam companies pay compensation to those affected. Unlike global population datasets, such local impact statements provide comprehensive, on-the-ground population counts that are not skewed by administrative boundaries. We then combined these with spatial information from satellite imagery.”

Part of this discrepancy likely stems from the fact that many countries don’t have the resources for precise data collection, and difficulty traveling to far flung rural areas only exacerbates census-counting discrepancies. A widespread underrepresentation of rural populations across the world could have profound impacts on those communities, as censuses are central to figuring out how to divvy up resources.

However, not everyone is convinced by this research. Stuart Gietel-Basten from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology told New Scientist that while increased investment in rural population data collection would be beneficial, the idea that Earth could contain a few billion more human inhabitants that we thought is extremely unlikely. “If we really are undercounting by that massive amount, it’s a massive news story and goes against all the years of thousands of other datasets.”

        <hr/>
        Catherine O’Hara, an actress who starred in legendary films “Beetlejuice” and “Home Alone” before taking a star turn as Moira Rose on the sitcom “Schitt’s Creek,” died Friday at the age of 71.

A statement from CAA, the agency that represented O’Hara, said she died at her home in Los Angeles following a brief illness.

After the success of “Home Alone” in 1990, O’Hara turned to collaborating with director Christopher Guest, starring in many of his iconic mockumentaries, including “Waiting for Guffman” (1996) and “Best in Show” (2000).

In those films, O’Hara worked often alongside Eugene Levy, becoming a signature duo who went on to co-star in the acclaimed “Schitt’s Creek” together. As wayward posh actress Moira Rose, O’Hara’s one-liners were meme gold and earned her critical praise. O’Hara won an Emmy in 2020, and in her she thanked creators Eugene and Dan Levy for “bestowing me the opportunity to play a woman of a certain age, my age, who gets to fully be her ridiculous self.”

        Price of oil nearly tops %24109 a barrel amid fears of a U.S. surgical strike in the Middle East

The yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note dips to 2.71%25 from 2.92%25 intraday high Friday

Stocks head lower around the globe%2C starting in Asia%2C then in Europe and the U.S.

Stocks tumbled and the price of crude oil surged Tuesday, fueled by fears the U.S. government is gearing up for a redoubled confrontation with Syria.

The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 170.33 points, or 1.1%, to 14,776.13. The Standard & Poor's 500 index plunged 26.30, or 1.6%, to 1,630.48.

The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 79.05 points, or 2.2%, to 3,578.52, as Facebook's effort to hit a post-IPO record high stumbled. The social media giant's shares fell below $40, dropping $1.70, or 4.1%, to $39.64.

On Monday, the Dow fell 0.4% to close at 14,946.46, dipping below 15,000 for the second straight week. The S&P 500 index slipped 0.4% to close at 1,656.78, more than 50 points off its all-time closing high of 1,709.67 on Aug. 2. The Nasdaq composite declined to 3,657.57.

Markets in the U.S. were rattled after Secretary of State John Kerry said there was "undeniable" evidence of a large-scale chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government against rebellious civilians last week, and suggested the administration was edging closer to a military response.

In global markets, Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark closed down 93.91 points, or 0.7%, to 13,542.37. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index finished down 130.55 points, or 0.6%, to 21,874.77, and Mumbai's Sensex index plunged 590 points, 3.2%, to end at 17,968.08 as the nation's currency, the rupee, hit a new low off recent comments in the Federal Reserve's policy-making meeting minutes.

In Europe, stocks sold off: UK's FTSE 100 index finished down 51.13 points, or 0.8% to 6,440.97 and Germany's DAX 30 index tumbled 2.3% to close at 8,242.56. France's CAC 40 index ended down 98.40 points, or 2.4%, to 3,968.73.

Gold, which typically rises as world tensions do, jumped $23 an ounce, or $1.6%, to $1,416.

In the U.S. Treasury market, another traditional safe haven, traders pushed prices up and yields down. The bellwether 10-year Treasury note yield fell to 2.72% from 2.81% Monday as its price surged.

Benchmark oil for October delivery jumped 2.8% to about $109 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

        <hr/>
        One way to trace the past nine years of Donald Trump is the journey from taco bowls to TACO bulls. (Hey, don’t click away! This is going somewhere!)

Back in May 2016, the then–GOP presidential candidate posted a picture of himself eating a Trump Tower Tex-Mex entree. “I love Hispanics!” he wrote. Nearly everyone understood this as an awkward pander.

Now, in May 2025, Wall Street is all over the “TACO trade,” another instance of people realizing they shouldn’t take the president at face value. “TACO” is short for “Trump always chickens out.” Markets have tended to go down when Trump announces new tariffs, but investors have recognized that a lot of this is bluffing, so they’re buying the dip and then profiting off the inevitable rally.

A reporter asked Trump about the expression on Wednesday, and he was furious. “I chicken out? I’ve never heard that,” he said. “Don’t ever say what you said. That’s a nasty question. To me, that’s the nastiest question.” The reaction demonstrates that the traders are right, because—to mix zoological metaphors—a hit dog will holler. The White House keeps talking tough about levying new tariffs on friends and geopolitical rivals alike, but Trump has frequently gone on to lower the measures or delay them for weeks or months.

Foreign leaders had figured out that Trump was a pushover by May 2017, and a year later, I laid out in detail his pattern of nearly always folding. He’s a desirable negotiating foil, despite his unpredictable nature, because he doesn’t tend to know his material well, has a short attention span, and can be easily manipulated by flattery. The remarkable thing is that it’s taken this long for Wall Street to catch on.

Even though no president has been so purely a businessman as Trump, he and the markets have never really understood each other. That is partly because, as I wrote yesterday, Trump just isn’t that good at business. Despite much glitzier ventures over the years, his most effective revenue sources have been rent collection at his legacy properties and rent-seeking as president. His approach to protectionism is premised on a basic misunderstanding of trade.

Yet Wall Street has never seemed to have much better of a grasp on Trump than he has on them, despite having many years to crack the code. (This is worth recalling when market evangelists speak about the supposed omniscience of markets.) Financiers have tried to understand Trump in black-and-white terms, but the task requires the nuanced recognition, for example, that he can be deadly serious about tariffs in the abstract and also extremely prone to folding on specifics.

Although they disdained him during his first term, many titans of industry sought accommodation with Trump during his 2024 campaign, hoping he’d be friendlier to their interests than Joe Biden had been. Once Trump’s term began, though, they were taken aback to learn that he really did want tariffs, even though he’d been advocating for them since the 1980s, had levied some in his first term, and had put them at the center of his 2024 campaign.

Trump’s commitment to tariffs, however, didn’t mean that he had carefully prepared for them or thought through their details. The administration has announced, suspended, reduced, or threatened new tariffs on China, Mexico, Canada, and the European Union. All of this volatility is ostensibly a product of ongoing negotiations, but in many cases, it’s also a response to market turmoil or because of a lack of clarity about details. (This week, two federal courts also ruled that the president was overstepping his authority by implementing tariffs under emergency powers.)

This is where the TACO trade comes in. Rather than panicking over every twist and turn, investors have begun to grasp the pattern. But every Wall Street arbitrage eventually loses its power once people get hip to it. In this case, the fact that Trump has learned about the TACO trade could be its downfall. The president may be fainthearted, but his track record shows that he can easily be dared into taking bad options by reporters just asking him about them.

One can imagine a bleak scenario here: Trump feels shamed into following through on an economically harmful tariff; markets initially don’t take him seriously, which removes any external pressure for him to reverse course. Once investors realize that he’s for real this time, they panic, and the markets tank. If the president stops chickening out, both Wall Street and the American people won’t be able to escape the consequences of his worst ideas.

        You might have forgotten about the trade war, but the trade war has not forgotten about you.

This week, Donald Trump reignited the global financial conflict he started in January, sending letters threatening new tariff rates to nearly two dozen countries. Starting in August, American importers will pay a 25 percent tax on goods from South Korea and Japan, a 35 percent tax on goods from Canada and Bangladesh, and a 50 percent tax on goods from Brazil unless those countries agree to bilateral deals. Additionally, Trump warned he would slap tariffs on goods from any country “aligned” with the “Anti-American policies” of China, India, and other industrial powerhouses—no further details given—and put a 50 percent levy on imported copper, used to build homes, electronics, and utility systems.

The summer tariff announcement was characteristic of all the White House’s tariff announcements this year: draconian, nonsensical, and hard to take seriously. In his first weeks in office, Trump trashed the North American trade agreement that he had negotiated during his first term before exempting most goods coming from Canada and Mexico from border taxes. In April, the White House put high levies on goods from scores of American trading partners, only to announce a three-month “pause” on those levies shortly after. During the 90-day pause, American negotiators would craft 90 new trade deals, the White House promised.

This time, Trump did not make a formal trade announcement, opting instead to send error-laden form letters to foreign capitals (one addressed the female leader of Bosnia and Herzegovina as “Mr. President”). In a Cabinet meeting, he argued that “a letter means a deal,” adding that “we can’t meet with 200 countries. We have a few trusted people that know what they’re doing, that are doing a good job, but you can’t—you have to do it in a more general way, but it’s a very good way, it’s a better way. It’s a more powerful way.” (Even if a letter was a deal, which it isn’t, the Trump administration is more than 60 letters short of 90.)

The stock market shrugged at the letters; investors are now used to the president saying something nuts and then doing nothing. Traders have figured out how to make money from the short-lived dips that Trump periodically causes, calling it the “TACO trade,” for “Trump always chickens out.” But Trump is not doing nothing. Businesses are struggling to negotiate the uncertainty created by the White House. Trump’s tariffs are forcing up consumer costs and damaging firms. And the latest renewal of the trade war will make the economy worse.

Small businesses and companies reliant on imported goods from high-rate countries are struggling the most. A few weeks ago, I spoke with Jonathan Silva, the chief executive officer of WS Game Company. On our Zoom call, he sat in front of a howitzer-size, rainbow-colored Nerf gun, sporting a five-o’clock shadow and emanating a heavy-lidded weltschmerz. His 22-person business produces upscale versions of classic Hasbro board games: a pastel, tempered-glass Monopoly board; a turquoise-and-white Scrabble set reminiscent of Portuguese azulejo tile work; and a three-dimensional wooden Clue game that looks like a billiards table. The idea is to make board games “part of your lifestyle,” he told me, instead of stuffing them “in a cardboard box with tattered corners, falling apart at the top of your coat closet.”

The company produces its games in China, meaning that the fee it pays to import its goods has changed several times in the past six months, going as high as 145 percent. The time around Trump’s April “Liberation Day” tariffs was the “worst 45-plus days of our company’s history,” Silva told me. His company put in place a spending freeze: halting bonuses, barring new hires, and cutting all unnecessary business expenses. “The main goal was to keep every employee that we have employed,” Silva told me. Then the company raised prices. “We tried to sell whatever we had domestically in our warehouses to free up cash and give us as long of a runway as possible,” he said. Even so, the company lost $16 million in purchase commitments from its sticker-shocked retailers.

The disruption from the spring will affect the rest of the business’s year, and, in particular, its crucial holiday-sales season, Silva told me. “It’s about 150 days from when I place an order to when it might hit the shelves,” he explained. “When the supply chain gets put on pause for four to six weeks, getting back on schedule takes a year.” That happened in a more extreme fashion during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.

This year, “the shelves might be filled with products for the holiday, but they might not be filled with the products that the retailers really want to put on the shelf,” Silva said. “The consumer might not notice, but the businesses do.”

Businesses thus far have sheltered American consumers from tariffs by eating some of the cost themselves and relying on stockpiled goods. As a result, inflation has remained subdued and economic growth strong enough through the first half of the year. But firms can keep only so much stock in warehouses. Analysts at BNP Paribas, a banking group, estimate that inventories will “clear” by the end of the summer, and prices will rise in turn. Right now, American consumers are facing an 18 percent effective tariff rate, the highest since 1934, the Yale Budget Lab estimates. Households will pay an average of $2,400 more for goods this calendar year, thanks to Trump’s policies.

Thousands of businesses are again negotiating extremely high and haphazardly implemented rates on goods from any number of crucial trading partners. South Korea sends billions of dollars of heavy machinery to the United States each year. Bangladesh ships billions of dollars of clothing. (Clothes and shoes will see the biggest price increases because of the trade war, the Yale analysts found; prices on these goods are expected to rise roughly 40 percent.) Canada is the United States’ second-largest trading partner, an important source of farm equipment, auto parts, minerals, and crops. And companies will have to negotiate whether to work in the cost of the new tariffs or to make their own TACO trades, assuming that the Trump administration will fold and cut rates again.

History suggests that this is exactly what Trump will do, especially if the market tanks. But who knows? This week, a reporter asked the president whether new tariff rates would take effect on July 9, the end of the 90-day pause, or on August 1, the date indicated in the letters.

“What are you talking about?” Trump asked.

The tariff rates, the reporter said.

The president provided some clarification: “They’re going to be tariffs. The tariffs are going to be the tariffs.”

        Sign up for Trump’s Return, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.

President Donald Trump could be close to taking over the Federal Reserve. On September 9, a federal district judge blocked Trump’s effort to remove Lisa Cook as a Federal Reserve governor; on Thursday, the administration petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the firing to go through. If the high court ends up siding with the administration, then Trump will have a clear path to filling the central bank with loyalists willing to vote the way he directs them to.

So far, most of the hand-wringing over this possibility has centered on Trump’s desire to dramatically cut interest rates, which could juice the economy and improve the GOP’s political prospects in the short term, but make inflation worse and destroy the Fed’s credibility in the long term. But the Fed has far more power than just setting rates; in fact, setting rates is the least of what it can do. The central bank determines the supply of money flowing through the economy, decides which institutions can have access to the financial system, and can print and spend money at will. If Trump takes control of the Fed, he will have attained extraordinary power to reward his friends and destroy his enemies.

The Constitution makes clear that Congress, not the president, holds the power to authorize new government spending. But a major exception to this rule exists. In 1932, Congress gave the Federal Reserve the power to lend money to “any individual, partnership, or corporation” during “unusual or exigent circumstances.” The Fed used the emergency-lending provision to make a few modest loans during the Great Depression. The power then lay dormant until the 2008 financial crisis, when the central bank issued hundreds of billions of dollars in loans in an effort to rescue major financial institutions on the brink of collapse. During the height of the coronavirus pandemic, the Fed went even further, offering trillions of dollars in loans not just to big banks but to corporations, small businesses, nonprofits, and even city governments.

Several legal experts told me that even this expansive use of the Fed’s lending authority was relatively restrained compared with what the central bank could do. Federal law imposes virtually no limits on what kind of institutions the Fed can lend to, how much money it can lend, or whether the loans ever need to be paid back. Whether any party would even have standing to sue the Fed for abusing its lending authority is unclear. As part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform act, Congress imposed a few restrictions, but these turned out to be vague and easily gamable. “There are really no limits to this power,” Aaron Klein, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former Treasury official who helped draft the relevant provisions of Dodd-Frank, told me. “The Fed can basically lend however much it wants, to whoever it wants, whenever it wants.”

Perhaps Trump would instruct his Fed appointees to exercise that power with restraint, lending only as needed to guide the economy through truly perilous circumstances. But little would stop him from instead treating the bank’s lending power as a bottomless slush fund. He could direct money to favored industries, such as crypto, or even his own businesses. He could reward media outlets that give him favorable coverage, companies that donate to Republican campaigns, and even the budgets of local officials who promote his agenda. If Democrats in Congress shut down the government to limit funds for ICE, say, he could send hundreds of billions of dollars to private contractors to keep operations moving. “It’s an infinite money pit,” Lev Menand, a professor at Columbia Law School who previously worked for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, told me. “There’s really nothing to stop the administration from lending trillions of dollars to the president’s priorities.”

Perhaps even more alarming, control of the Fed would give the president a powerful weapon for punishing his enemies. The Fed is the central node of the U.S. financial system. Every major bank in the country holds a master checking account at the Fed, which they depend on to make and receive payments, manage their reserves, and access credit. The central bank, in turn, operates as the country’s main financial regulator: It determines whether banks are in compliance with existing laws on financial risk management and illicit transactions, for example, and has various ways to enforce that compliance, ultimately backed by the threat of cutting off access to the financial system altogether.

The Fed has considerable discretion over how it uses this authority, giving it enormous power over not only the country’s banks but all of the individuals, businesses, and organizations that require any kind of financial services. The response to marijuana legalization by one regional Fed branch is an instructive example. When Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, the Kansas City Fed, which has regulatory jurisdiction over the state, declared that banks offering financial services to cannabis sellers were in violation of federal law, implying they could lose their master accounts at the Fed. As a result, the state’s banks largely refused to provide services to marijuana businesses, forcing them to choose between dealing in cash, banking illegally, or going out of business. Colorado tried to fix this by passing a law authorizing the creation of special “marijuana financial-services cooperatives,” to provide credit for the industry, but the Fed refused to allow the new institutions access to the federal financial system. When one of the newly formed credit unions sued, the courts sided with the central bank.

How might Trump use the power to “debank,” as it is sometimes called? Take the administration’s threats against prominent left-leaning donors and organizations such as George Soros’s Open Society Foundations and the Ford Foundation following the murder of Charlie Kirk. Trump could designate them as a “domestic terrorist threat” and direct the Fed to cut off any bank that does business with them. “That kind of thing is basically what happened with cannabis,” Klein told me. “It isn’t hard to imagine the same powers being used to go after Trump’s enemies.”

The tools Trump has used so far to bend institutions to his will, such as withholding federal funding, are powerful, but they pale in comparison to the power of debanking. An organization subjected to such treatment would be unable to pay its employees, manage its endowment, or receive funding from government or private sources. An individual would be unable to receive direct deposits from their employer, get a mortgage from a bank, or pay their bills. “If you’re made a persona non grata by the Fed, that’s completely debilitating,” Menand told me. “It’s the financial equivalent of cutting someone off from the electricity grid.”

Several legal experts told me that, given the broad discretion the courts have given the Fed over both lending and financial regulation, the judiciary would be unlikely to stop Trump from taking full advantage of the central bank’s powers. In theory, the market itself could provide the necessary check: Reckless actions could cause investors to panic and tank the stock and bond markets, forcing the administration to back down. But control of the Fed would also give the administration plenty of tools to placate the markets with low interest rates and easy money. The only sure check on Trump’s power would be Congress stepping in to amend the Federal Reserve Act. But this would require an implausible two-thirds majority vote to overcome a presidential veto in both chambers.

And so the most likely way to prevent these scenarios from unfolding is for the Supreme Court to rule that the firing of Lisa Cook was illegal, preventing Trump from taking over the central bank in the first place. If it instead green-lights Trump’s efforts, the scale of what could ensue is difficult to predict. Most of the experts who have worked within the Fed or studied it closely have never contemplated what could happen if an institution with so much unchecked power came under the control of one man. Perhaps it’s time to start imagining.

        There is a certain eerie familiarity to the Trump administration’s slow roll to war with Venezuela. There is the ominous military buildup, the shifting rationales, and even a shaky claim of “weapons of mass destruction,” thanks to the administration’s recent reclassification of fentanyl, to help justify its attacks.

The conflict with Venezuela will probably play out differently than the Iraq War did—perhaps better, perhaps worse. But the moral basis upon which it is being waged is most certainly worse.

The administration initially justified its campaign, which has already involved 28 known U.S. attacks against boats that officials have claimed were carrying illegal drugs, as a defensive war to stop the flow of drugs. “This mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X last month.

Given Venezuela’s slight role in the supply chain of illicit drugs to the United States, and President Donald Trump’s otherwise fairly lax approach to the narcotics trade—he has pardoned or granted clemency to more than 90 drug criminals across both terms—whispers began circulating recently that the true motive was pecuniary, that Trump was really interested in Venezuela’s oil. “This is a shakedown—a financial shakedown, being done primarily for profit,” one official told my colleagues Vivian Salama and Sarah Fitzpatrick last week.

This secret motive didn’t stay secret very long. Last week the president told reporters that the U.S. had seized a “very large” oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela “for a very good reason.” Asked what would happen to the oil, he responded: “I assume we’re going to keep the oil.” Trump then demanded this week that Venezuela pay for the oil assets the country had apparently stolen from the U.S. Speaking to reporters, he framed the conflict as retribution: “They took our oil rights. We have a lot of oil there. As you know, they threw our companies out, and we want it back.” Trump has ordered a naval “blockade” aimed at Venezuela’s oil industry.

Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller has tried to blend Trump’s mob-like account with the supposed ideals and concerns that initially motivated this campaign, writing on X: “American sweat, ingenuity and toil created the oil industry in Venezuela. Its tyrannical expropriation was the largest recorded theft of American wealth and property. These pillaged assets were then used to fund terrorism and flood our streets with killers, mercenaries and drugs.”

More than 20 years ago, George W. Bush’s critics accused him of going to war in Iraq for the oil. But President Bush made it plain that this was not his objective. At the outset of the conflict, he called Iraq’s oil wells “a source of wealth that belongs to the Iraqi people,” and he never turned them over to American hands.

Trump did not oppose the Iraq War at the time, but he did present himself as a critic after it went south. His most consistent reason for his opposition was that America had failed to seize Iraq’s oil, despite the fact that doing so would have been a war crime.

In his first term in office, Trump repeatedly expressed his regret that the U.S. failed to use its interventions in Iraq and Libya to seize their oil reserves, and tried to use American troops in Iraq and Syria for this purpose. But like many of his first-term impulses, this one was dismissed and deterred by his subordinates for being impossibly unrealistic, immoral, or criminal. Trump’s second term has seen many of the president’s once-unimaginable demands transformed into official policy.

The fact that Trump wants to seize Venezuela’s oil wealth does not mean it will happen. Nor does it mean that this is the administration’s sole motive. The Washington Post reports that Miller’s support for the war evolved out of a desire to attack drug cartels in Mexico, and he seems to believe that war will make it easier for him to declare Venezuelan migrants enemy combatants and deport them.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whose thinking aligns with more traditional Republican foreign-policy goals, wants to depose Venezuela’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro. It is true that Maduro has crushed what remains of the country’s democracy and installed a kleptocratic leadership. But Trump’s plan to use war to seize Venezuelan wealth is incompatible with democratizing the country. Any Venezuelan government committed to transferring its national wealth to foreign hands will lose legitimacy immediately, and will succeed in holding power only through raw force.

Trump has long benefited from his contrast with the second Bush administration’s failed experiments with nation building. He has dismissed his Republican critics as neoconservatives, and some left-wing populists credit him for moving his party away from Bush-style interventionism.

Yet Trump’s saber-rattling against Venezuela confirms that his argument with neoconservatism was never about the hubris of exporting democracy or a faith in pacifistic leadership. Trump’s main complaint about Bush was that he squandered an opportunity to enrich the U.S. by caring too much about international law and the dignity of the Iraqi people. For all their arrogant blundering, neoconservatives were at least motivated by ideals about promoting American values around the world. Trump seems eager to replace this doctrine with an old and naked form of imperialism.

        <hr/>
        President Donald Trump can hardly conceal his disgust for the word affordability, referring to its ascendance in America’s political lexicon as a “hoax,” a “con job,” and a “fake narrative” perpetuated by Democrats. But there’s one sign that he’s treating it like a very real political vulnerability: The former reality-television host is trying to give people cash.

In recent weeks, Trump has been pitching half a dozen schemes to, in the words of White House officials, put money “straight into the pockets of the American people.” After a year in which Americans’ pocketbooks have been walloped by Trump’s tariffs, cuts to the social safety net, and apparent nonchalance in the face of spiking health-care costs, the president is turning to the allure of sweepstakes-style checks from the government to help coax voters out of their financial malaise ahead of next year’s midterm elections. It likely won’t work, economists from across the political spectrum told me; one likened the payments to a bandage over a bullet wound.

Trump has floated a payment of $2,000 to most Americans in the form of a so-called tariff dividend, to be paid out from fees levied on foreign goods. He has offered $12 billion in relief to farmers reeling from the trade war he started. He has suggested paying subsidies “directly to the people” to pay for health insurance. And as my colleagues Ashley Parker and Nancy Youssef reported, Trump used a prime-time national address on December 17 to announce onetime bonus checks for troops in the amount of $1,776. “The checks are already on the way,” Trump said of the payments to 1.4 million service members. (The Pentagon says the money, which is being taken from a fund to improve housing for troops, landed in bank accounts before Christmas.)

Although the proposals each have different designs and purposes, taken together, they represent a concerted effort to neutralize the cost-of-living concerns dominating voters’ minds. Those worries are likely to only increase as Americans contend with rising health-care costs and growing signs of unease in the labor market, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told me. Trump’s proposed payments are ill-suited to deal with those macroeconomic trend lines, he said. “It’s not a solution to anybody’s problem,” he said. “It doesn’t address inflation; it doesn’t address the weak labor market. It doesn’t address the fact that many Americans don’t have any assets and owe a lot on their credit cards.”

As the president’s first year in office comes to a close, the economy is showing signs of significant strain. A delayed jobs report earlier this month showed that the country’s unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6 percent in November, the highest since 2021. Young people and Black Americans are facing especially high rates of unemployment, which some economists see as a warning sign for the broader economy. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned recently of “a labor market that seems to have significant downside risks.” Consumer sentiment has neared record lows in recent months, a somberness that Trump appeared determined to counteract during his rambling speech on December 17, in which he blamed high prices and low wages on former President Joe Biden and shouted a series of misleading statistics about how the economy is great.

Michael Strain, the director of economic-policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, told me that the president’s attempts to convince Americans that their financial circumstances are better than they think sound “eerily similar” to the strategy that Biden embraced amid widespread concerns over the cost of living. Trump’s desire to entice voters with onetime payments is unlikely to improve his standing, Strain said. “People don’t like higher prices, and they don’t like higher prices even if their incomes are going up faster than prices,” he said. “And my guess is that people’s dislike of higher prices will not be mitigated by a onetime gift from Uncle Sam.”

The White House did not respond to questions about the president’s plans for any further cash handouts, but a spokesperson disputed the idea that the payouts Trump has proposed so far were part of a broader political strategy to address affordability.

Although Trump has repeatedly described America as “the hottest country anywhere in the world” and declared that a “golden era” of prosperity has dawned, his rosy view is not widely shared by the public. An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released earlier this month found that only 36 percent of Americans approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, the lowest number the president has received on that question during his two terms (57 percent of Americans disapprove). With the midterms less than a year away, voters appear to give Democrats a slight edge over Republicans on the question of whom they trust more to handle the economy. Seventy percent of respondents said the cost of living where they reside is not very affordable or not affordable at all.

It’s little wonder, then, that Trump is repeatedly talking about brighter days ahead and promising Americans cash infusions that he says will allow them to benefit from what he has described as a deluge of dollars flowing into the country from abroad. “We’ve taken in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff money,” Trump told reporters last month, promising that the $2,000 in “dividends” would be delivered to voters in mid-2026. There are some potential issues. The proposal would probably cost more than the roughly $200 billion that America has collected in tariffs over the past year, and Trump would presumably need congressional approval for the preelection payouts. The president has already made a habit of using the tariff money—much of it paid by American companies and consumers—as a personal reserve fund he can direct as he sees fit. Trump has said the $12 billion his administration is offering to struggling farmers is being sourced from the tariff funds. During the government shutdown in October, the president covered a lapse in funding for a nutrition program supporting women and children by unilaterally tapping tariff revenue. In announcing the $1,776 payment to troops—which he referred to as “a warrior dividend”—Trump said twice that the $2.5 billion program was made possible, in part, “because of tariffs,” though the Pentagon has clarified that the money actually comes from the military-housing stipend, which Congress has already approved.

Several Republicans oppose Trump’s tariffs—and some are privately hoping the Supreme Court will rule them unconstitutional next year. Trump proposed the $2,000 payments shortly after Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism of his power to levy broad tariffs unilaterally.

The White House has not yet provided details on Trump’s plan for the tariff dividend, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously said that such a plan would indeed require legislation from Congress. The proposal has faced a cool reception on Capitol Hill, where Republicans have said that any revenue from tariffs should go toward paying down the nation’s $38 trillion in debt. Trump-administration officials have sought to draw more attention to the tax bill Congress passed over the summer, reminding voters that some of its financial benefits are expected to kick in next year. Speaking at the Treasury Department earlier this month, Bessent touted a program that will offer babies born from 2025 to 2028 an investment fund seeded with a $1,000 grant from the government. Although the money in the accounts cannot be withdrawn until the year a child turns 18, the president’s allies have tried to brand the program as another instance of Trump putting money directly into Americans’ pockets.

The IRS recently revealed the process for establishing the “Trump Accounts,” launching a new website and tax form for parents to claim the money and contribute their own funds beginning in July. “Trump accounts are the president’s gift to the American people,” Bessent said at the Treasury, calling IRS Form 4547, which is named after Trump’s two presidential terms, “the most aptly named tax document of all time.” Administration officials are also trying to pitch the tax law as a more immediate boon to voters struggling with the rising price of groceries, housing, child care, and other expenses. “Next spring is projected to be the largest tax-refund season of all time,” Trump said during his prime-time address.

Provisions of the tax law signed in July were made retroactive to 2025, meaning the sliver of Americans who will benefit from reduced taxes on tipped wages, overtime, and Social Security payments will likely see larger tax refunds when they file in the new year. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on December 11 that Americans could expect an average of about $1,000 in additional tax refunds next year. But unlike Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which included a broad reduction of existing rates across income brackets, the 2025 bill was primarily designed to keep those tax cuts from expiring—meaning that many Americans will not notice as big of a difference in their take-home pay as they did eight years ago. And the wave of company-sponsored employee bonuses that Trump celebrated in 2017, after his original law significantly reduced the corporate tax rate, have not recurred.

Other provisions of the 2025 bill, including a larger deduction for state and local taxes and a new write-off for people who buy American-made vehicles, affect only a relatively small portion of the public, including wealthy people in high-tax states and those financially secure enough to purchase a brand-new car (at an average price now upwards of $50,000). The legislation’s curbs on spending for social programs, by contrast, could be felt broadly among the poorest Americans. Medicaid recipients and food-stamp beneficiaries will face some of the steepest cuts. The bill also did not address the looming expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies, which is set to increase premiums for some 22 million Americans next month.

Facing angst from voters and some members of Congress over the fact that the new year will cause health-care costs to double for millions of voters, Trump is again offering cash as a salve. “I want the money to go directly to the people so you can buy your own health care; you’ll get much better health care at a much lower price,” he said in his prime-time address, resurfacing a loose proposal to turn the expiring subsidies into new government-funded health-savings accounts. But the president has not provided much detail about how the proposal would work and has not done much to push Congress to pass a new law before premiums spike. Earlier this month, four moderate Republicans vented their frustration by joining Democrats to back a discharge petition extending the current subsidies for three years. The legislation has a strong chance of passing the House in January, but faces long odds in the Senate, where Republicans have already voted down a similar proposal.

The situation has frustrated voters like Stacy Rye, a 56-year-old real-estate agent in Missoula, Montana, who is staring at a massive increase in premiums next year. Rye told me that on top of the spiking costs for coffee, beef, and other groceries she already deals with, she will have to pay an extra $6,700 next year for health-care premiums. The plan by some Republican lawmakers to offer Americans up to $1,500 for health-savings accounts did not seem like it would help much, she said.

“What am I supposed to do with $1,500 when my premium is $1,300 a month?” she said, adding that Trump’s plan to have consumers haggle with insurance companies and hospitals seemed unworkable. “These are unserious people. I can’t negotiate against a giant company about what my health premiums are going to be.”

The president’s penchant for direct government payments goes back to 2020, when Congress responded to the coronavirus pandemic by passing several pieces of legislation that offered cash to struggling Americans. Trump put his name on the checks—the first of which offered $1,200 per adult—and sent letters to voters reminding them of his role in approving the “Economic Impact Payments.”

But economists later concluded that the flood of money injected into the economy during the pandemic—an approach Biden continued after taking office in 2021—helped worsen the soaring inflation that ultimately eased Trump’s return to the White House.

Now the president is facing the reality that many of his promises to quickly turn the economy around have fallen flat with a growing number of voters. And his well-worn tactic of pitching cash payments to voters at a time of deep uncertainty about the fundamentals of the economy may not be enough to reverse their disillusionment.

        <hr/>
        In Marco Rubio’s telling, the stunning events in Venezuela on Saturday illustrate an essential truth—possibly the essential truth—about Donald Trump’s presidency: Global leaders cross him at their peril. “I don’t understand yet how they haven’t figured this out,” Trump’s secretary of state told reporters at Mar-a-Lago just hours after the capture of Nicolás Maduro.

World leaders could be forgiven for not understanding the simplicity of the Trump Doctrine, especially those who assume that the world’s dominant superpower still possesses complicated mechanisms for the manufacture of foreign-policy strategies. The country that gave the world the Truman Doctrine and the Reagan Doctrine as well as Trump’s apparent favorite, the Monroe Doctrine, now embraces the plainest and most ostentatiously bellicose of national-security policies: Fuck around and find out. Trump’s own Pentagon chief, the self-styled (until Congress approves the title change) secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, said as much when he told the nation that Maduro “effed around, and he found out.”

If the Fuck Around and Find Out Doctrine doesn’t sound like a concept for a stable and predictable foreign policy—one purpose of Washington’s doctrine-articulation complex—then maybe you can sympathize with those who Rubio says are still struggling to get it. Some experts reject the idea that something this crude even earns the right to be called a doctrine. As John Bolton, currently a Trump nemesis but once one of his first-term national security advisers, told us, “There is no Trump Doctrine: No matter what he does, there is no grand conceptual framework; it’s whatever suits him at the moment.” Kori Schake, the director of foreign- and defense-policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, cautioned us that “we shouldn’t ennoble Trump policy by saying there’s a doctrine.”

In the early decades of the 20th century, “America First” was in part a euphemism for U.S. isolation from the ravages of war in Europe. Trump then revived the term, starting in 2016, when he promised to end America’s long post-9/11 conflicts, which cost taxpayers trillions and failed to deliver clear victories. Instead, he would prioritize domestic issues and the well-being of Americans. Yet there he was on Saturday at Mar-a-Lago, vowing to “run Venezuela for the foreseeable future.” And if that involves a bit of nation building and American boots on the ground, well, so be it. Trump, it turns out, seems to believe that a little foreign adventurism is just fine, as long as he’s the one doing the adventuring. It was a departure from his previous instinct to limit his foreign interventions to short, kinetic bursts of force—an unofficial one-and-done doctrine—visible in his first-term strike on the Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani and his more recent decision to dispatch U.S. bombers deep into Iran.

“Rebuilding is not a bad thing, in Venezuela’s case; the country has gone to hell,” Trump told our colleague Michael Scherer in an interview yesterday. But when asked why similar actions in Iraq were an abomination, the president punted. “That was Bush,” Trump said. “You’ll have to ask Bush that question, because we should have never gone into Iraq. That started the Middle East disaster.” (In a separate Atlantic interview last year, Trump said that “America First” is whatever he says it is: “Considering that the term wasn’t used until I came along, I think I’m the one that decides that.”)

The White House quickly embraced the newly articulated doctrine, circulating after Saturday’s Mar-a-Lago press conference an image of a determined-looking Trump striding up steps, with the caption—you guessed it—“FAFO.” Another administration publicity push featured Rubio’s warning to foreign nations to not “play games with President Trump,” a politer version of the same idea. “The 47th president of the United States is not a game player,” Rubio said at Mar-a-Lago. “If you don’t know, now you know.” (It’s unclear if Rubio—a self-professed rap fan—was deliberately quoting the Notorious B.I.G., but the White House later posted a video set to the Biggie song.)

It should come as no surprise that Hegseth, with his penchant for scrapping on social media and dressing down generals for being fat, is practically tripping over himself to make FAFO happen. Asked Saturday about where the FAFO policy has applied, Hegseth cited Iran’s nuclear program, Houthi rebels in Yemen, and the southern U.S. border. “There’s been a lot of politicians that want to talk. They want to talk peace. They want to talk diplomacy. They want to talk negotiations. They want to talk globalism and international organizations,” he told CBS News. “President Trump speaks through action.”

So far, Trump appears most willing to take a FAFO approach to the Western Hemisphere. One person close to Trump told us that the president has embraced a different set of criteria for responding to what he sees as irritants in the Americas—such as Maduro—than for those farther afield. “If this were happening in a different part of the globe, none of this would have taken place,” this person said on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly. In other words, Trump views many parts of this hemisphere as a rightful extension of his U.S. sandbox, where he is free to snatch and grab what he pleases. (That glistening Venezuelan oil? The Panama Canal? Mine! That tantalizing slice of Greenland? Also mine!)

Trump told Scherer that Greenland had not been on his mind when he’d been ousting Maduro—but he then proceeded to offer real-time foreign-policy musings on that very topic, in one of his characteristic verbal weaves. “You know, I wasn’t referring to Greenland at that time, but we do need Greenland, absolutely,” Trump said. “And we need it for defense. You know, it’s surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships. We need Greenland.” (Katie Miller, the wife of the top Trump adviser Stephen Miller, posted an image on social media on Saturday of Greenland covered by an American flag, with the caption: “SOON.” And Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, urged Washington yesterday to end its threats, which she said make “absolutely no sense.”)

Kevin Whitaker, who served as U.S. ambassador to Colombia during the Obama and first Trump administrations, told us that the president’s “or else” approach to Venezuela is visible in Trump’s second-term blueprint for global statecraft. The idea behind Trump’s new National Security Strategy, Whitaker said, is that “we’re the hegemon in this hemisphere, and we can do whatever we want, including actions that are of questionable legitimacy.” The manifesto even cites a “Trump corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, the early-19th-century policy that sought to block European colonial activity in the Americas.

Like his predecessors, however, the U.S. president isn’t just seeking to fend off transatlantic imperialists; he is also laying claim to the hemisphere’s strategic sites and resources. The Maduro ouster is a manifestation of Trump and his senior officials’ belief that powerful countries have the right to dominate their surrounding continents and oceans, an idea uncomfortably close to China’s hegemonic claim to the western Pacific and Russia’s imperial designs on Ukraine and other nations of the former Soviet Union. And U.S. actions, in turn, are designed to signal to those rival powers to stay away. One U.S. official told us that he believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin has been “scared shitless” by the U.S. grabbing Maduro because he knows “not to fuck with the U.S. military.”

Trump, at the Mar-a-Lago press conference on Saturday, blamed past presidents for fighting far-off wars while allowing leftist regimes in America’s vicinity to fester. He alleged that Venezuela has committed a host of offenses, including sending criminals to the United States en masse, running drugs, and stealing American oil. “All of these actions were in gross violation of the core principles of American foreign policy dating back more than two centuries—not anymore,” Trump said. “The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we’ve superseded it by a lot, by a real lot.”

Many Venezuelans, both at home and in the U.S., welcomed Maduro’s ouster after more than a decade of economic mismanagement, corruption, and repression. Trump said at Mar-a-Lago that a group of senior officials, including Rubio and Hegseth, would be part of a group that would “run” Venezuela. But that’s about as far as the planning appears to have gone. On NBC News’s Meet the Press yesterday, when asked whether he and other senior officials were indeed running Venezuela, Rubio responded that U.S. officials were just “running policy” there. He also depicted the capture of Maduro as a law-enforcement operation to apprehend the president and his wife because they face charges in U.S. court. “We are not going to be able to allow in our hemisphere a country that becomes a crossroads for the activities of all of our adversaries around the world,” he said.

Trump told reporters on Air Force One yesterday evening, “This isn’t a country, like, we have to travel 24 hours in an airplane. This is Venezuela. This is our area: the Don-roe Doctrine.” He also managed, in just 37 minutes, to threaten or hint at military action against Colombia, Cuba, Greenland, Iran, Mexico, and Venezuela (again).

Even before he extracted Maduro, Trump was employing the instruments of U.S. power in new, radical, and contradictory ways across the Americas. His administration has threatened to strike cartels in Mexico over its government’s objections, pardoned a former Honduran president convicted in the U.S. on drug-trafficking offenses, and offered a $20 billion line of credit to Argentina.

“There’s example after example of where they treat the Americas differently than they treat involvement elsewhere,” Ricardo Zuniga, who served as a senior official for Latin America during the Biden administration, told us. “They have a very 19th-century view of the world, and they’re proud of that.” The United States’ historic penchant for heavy-handed involvement in Latin America has often had a perversely counterproductive effect, from Nicaragua and Cuba in the early 1900s to Chile in the 1970s: It has given rise to generations of nationalist leaders who railed against Yankee imperialism.

There may be other limits on the FAFO doctrine. The person close to Trump said that the president still has no appetite for a prolonged occupation of a foreign nation. But he is more than willing to use the threat of such action as leverage over the country’s interim leaders. In Venezuela, that is Maduro’s second-in-command, Delcy Rodríguez, who was sworn in as interim president on Saturday. Trump has made clear that there is an “or else” hanging over her head: a second wave of military action should she not comply with U.S. demands. “If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told Scherer yesterday.

It is all, this person said, part of the plan. “Most presidents would not go out and say, ‘I’m not afraid to put boots on the ground,’ because their base would go, ‘Wait a minute,’” the person told us. “But Trump is willing to be misunderstood in the short term to get what he wants.”

        Hiring remained anemic in December, closing out the weakest year for job growth since the beginning of the pandemic.

U.S. employers added just 50,000 jobs last month, according to a report Friday from the Labor Department. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dipped to 4.4%, from 4.5% in November, while job gains for October and November were also revised down by a total of 76,000 jobs.

For all of 2025, employers added 584,000 jobs — compared to 2 million new jobs in 2024. That meant that last year was the worst for employment growth since 2020.

Health care and hospitality were among the few industries adding jobs in December. Health care employment is generally immune from ups and downs in the business cycle.

Manufacturing continues to lose workers, cutting 8,000 jobs in December. Factories have been in a slump for the last 10 months, according to an index of manufacturing activity compiled by the Institute for Supply Management. The sector has been hit hard by President Trump's tariffs, since many domestic manufacturers rely on some foreign components.

"Morale is very low across manufacturing in general," said an unnamed factory manager quoted in this week's ISM report. "The cost of living is very high, and component costs are increasing with folks citing tariffs and other price increases."

The federal government added 2,000 jobs in December, but is still down 277,000 jobs from the beginning of the year. The government recorded big job losses earlier in the fall, when workers who accepted buyouts officially dropped off the government's payroll.

While unemployment remains low by historical standards, workers are increasingly nervous about job security. A survey last month by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found workers slightly more worried about losing their job in the coming year, and less confident about finding a new job if they are laid off.

The slowdown in hiring makes people who already have jobs reluctant to give them up. The resulting lack of turnover means fewer job openings for young people and others trying to get a foot in the door.

        President Donald Trump denied having any knowledge of the Justice Department's investigation into the Federal Reserve after the agency subpoenaed the central bank Friday.

“I don’t know anything about it, but he’s certainly not very good at the Fed, and he’s not very good at building buildings,” Trump said of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in a brief interview with NBC News Sunday night.

Powell said Sunday that the Justice Department was threatening the Federal Reserve with possible criminal indictment related to his testimony before the Senate in June about the renovation of the agency's office buildings.

“No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law,” Powell said. “But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure.”

The move comes after a yearlong campaign by Trump to pressure Powell to lower interest rates, and Powell said Sunday he believed the latest move by the administration was part of that effort.

"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President," Powell said.

Trump told NBC News on Sunday that the Justice Department subpoenas have nothing to do with interest rates.

“No. I wouldn’t even think of doing it that way. What should pressure him is the fact that rates are far too high. That’s the only pressure he’s got,” Trump said.

“He’s hurt a lot of people,” he added. “I think the public is pressuring him.”

On Dec. 29, in remarks at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump raised the possibility of legal action against Powell around the renovations.

"We're thinking about bringing a suit against Powell for incompetence. ... He said, $4 billion more, it's going to end up causing more than $4 billion, $4 billion. It’s the highest price of construction," Trump said, adding, "There is nothing you can do about he's just a very incompetent man, but we're going to probably bring a lawsuit against him."

The Justice Department's investigation met with swift backlash from Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., a member of the Banking Committee, who said he will not vote to confirm any of Trump's nominees — including for the position of chair — for the Federal Reserve.

“I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed—including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy—until this legal matter is fully resolved,” he said in a statement.

“If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,” he said.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of the Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Banking Committee, said in a statement that Trump is "abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends."

"This Committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair,” she added.

Powell's term as chairman ends in May, but his position as a member of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors doesn’t expire until 2028.

The White House declined to comment, referring all inquiries to the Justice Department. A spokesperson for that agency said they could not comment on any specific case.

“The attorney general has instructed her U.S. attorneys to prioritize investigating any abuse of taxpayer dollars,” the spokesperson said.

The Federal Reserve is not funded through taxpayer dollars. The central bank and its regional banks are funded by fees on services like check processing, as well loans it makes to corporate banks and the income it gets from its investment portfolio of U.S. government bonds, foreign currencies and other securities.

Timothy Lauer, a spokesperson for the office of the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia — the office handling the case — said, “We do not comment on ongoing investigations.”

The Justice Department has previously opened investigations into current and former government officials following public pressure from Trump.

In October, Trump posted a message on Truth Social telling Attorney General Pam Bondi that it was time for the Justice Department to take legal action against former FBI Director James Comey, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and New York Attorney General Letitia James — all of whom he has battled publicly.

Jerome Powell isn’t known for his expressiveness. The chair of the Federal Reserve has kept quiet over the past year as President Trump has repeatedly attacked him—often with crude language (think moron, numbskull, dumb, and loser). That changed yesterday, when Powell announced that he is under criminal investigation by Trump’s Justice Department. In a video statement, he responded to the threat of indictment with remarkable clarity. “This unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure,” he said. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.”

For the first time, Powell plainly articulated the Fed’s fight to retain independence from a president seeking to sway it. The investigation itself has to do with whether Powell misled Congress last year about the Fed’s renovation project—now estimated to be about $700 million over budget. The White House Office of Management and Budget began looking into those statements last July; Powell has said that under his leadership, the Fed has “made every effort” to keep Congress informed about the project. It’s hard to ignore the irony here: The administration that demolished the White House’s East Wing without congressional approval is now cracking down on construction oversight.

Asked by NBC about the investigation into Powell, Trump said, “I don’t know anything about it, but he’s certainly not very good at the Fed, and he’s not very good at building buildings.” Yet, as Powell notes, evidence suggests that this move is the culmination of Trump’s monthslong campaign to pressure him into lowering interest rates. Lowering rates would boost the economy in the near term but risk a bust in the longer term. It is the job of the Fed’s Board of Governors, with Powell at the helm, not to accede to any pressure here. The governors are meant to carefully raise and lower the cost of borrowing over time according to jobs and inflation data. The Fed makes these decisions based on what it thinks is best for the American money supply—not what the president wants.

Trump seems to disagree. In August, he made the unprecedented (and probably illegal) decision to fire one of the Fed’s governors, Lisa Cook. The stated reason for Cook’s firing was mortgage fraud, although she has not been charged with any crime and has denied the allegation; the Supreme Court will hear arguments in her case next week. He also elevated a new governor, the MAGA loyalist Stephen Miran, who has been pushing for more dramatic rate cuts than his peers.

Cook’s firing was Trump’s most significant attempt to exert control over the Fed until last night. Even if Powell survives this investigation and serves his full term as chair, which is up in just four months, Trump may still gain access by way of a handpicked successor. The smart money is now on Kevin Hassett, whom my colleague Rogé Karma has called a “Trump propagandist.” But the GOP, including some members of Congress whose votes could one day confirm Trump’s pick, has been expressing alarm over the investigation into Powell. Senator Thom Tillis said he would oppose the confirmation of any nominee until “this legal matter is fully resolved.” And markets were mostly calm today, suggesting that traders think Powell—and central bank independence—will ultimately win out, the Columbia Law professor and former New York Fed economist Lev Menand told me.

Powell’s future is uncertain, and the broader erosion of the Department of Justice has made it hard to trust the idea of an objective investigation. But the probe itself is a clear threat to the long-standing independence of the Fed. The past three Fed chairs—Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Alan Greenspan—alongside a bipartisan coalition of top economic officials released a statement today decrying the move against Powell. “This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly,” it read.

To better understand their concern, look to Turkey, Zimbabwe, or any other country where central-bank credibility has been undermined. When faith in central banks fails, so can faith in the value of money, leading to hyperinflation. But unlike the Turkish lira and the now-defunct Zimbabwean dollar, the U.S. dollar anchors the global economy. Any sense from the international community that the Fed no longer pulls the strings could be catastrophic. “The central bank is critical to the functioning of the entire financial system,” Menand said. The Fed’s powers are essential tools in moments of instability, but in the wrong hands, they could do far more than weaken the dollar. All major banks hold accounts at the Fed, and those accounts can be cut off at its discretion. Anyone who uses an American bank, and who finds themselves on the president’s bad side, could be affected.

Powell’s prerecorded video statement distills our current moment in less than two minutes. The Fed’s freedom from partisanship is at the core of its mission; it was created in service of the country’s long-term interests. Now under siege by a sitting president, it has become an unlikely site of resistance.

How Bad Bunny Did It

By Spencer Kornhaber

A few years ago, I visited my childhood home and heard a surprising sound: the bright and bouncy music of the Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny. My parents are white Baby Boomers who speak no Spanish and have never shown a taste for hip-hop, but they’d somehow gotten into Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, whose sex-and-rum-drenched lyrics they couldn’t begin to decipher. The vector of transmission appeared to be the streaming service hooked to their smart speakers. When in need of a pick-me-up, Mom would shout, “Alexa, play Bad Bunny,” and make her Southern California kitchen sound like a San Juan nightclub.

        <hr/>
        European leaders are in a dither, understandably but inexcusably, about Donald Trump’s threats to take Greenland by force, and to use tariffs to slap around anyone who objects: understandably, because no previous president would ever have acted this way; inexcusably, because a clear if unpalatable solution lies right before them.

If European countries were to permanently deploy, say, 5,000 soldiers armed with surface-to-air and anti-ship missiles to Greenland, keeping them there with orders to fight invading American soldiers to the last round of ammunition, Trump would not order the paratroops and the Marines to assault that frozen wasteland—too many body bags. If they were willing to put comparable economic sanctions in place—denying American companies access to Europe’s economy, still collectively the world’s third largest—he would back down from those threats as well. Such policies go against the grain of a continent that is, to use the word popularized by the British military historian Michael Howard, debellated, but that’s the world they are in.

The Greenland episode, disgraceful and shameful as it is, should be seen in the context of Trump’s other foreign-policy escapades—the capturing of Nicolás Maduro; the bombing of the Iranian nuclear program; the attempt to rebuild and reorient war-shattered Gaza; the on-again, off-again relationships with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky; the tariff bazookas that get downgraded to squirt guns with China. Erratic as the president sounds, the Trumpian worldview is comprehensible and even, in some respects, predictable.

Trump is an ignorant man; unlike many other would-be or actual dictators, he does not read books and has difficulty writing more than a few badly spelled sentences on social media. But he does intuit certain truths, and one must give him credit for those, because he is not stupid and they animate his policy. Greenland really has been neglected by Denmark and, since after the American Civil War, has been coveted by the United States. The Iranian nuclear program was a regional and in some respects global menace, and, after a week and a half of Israel softening up, was vulnerable to a single heavy punch. Europe has long underspent on defense, and where American cajoling for decades had not worked, a few face slaps succeeded.

Trump’s domestic political gift is the feral instinct for weakness that characterizes most authoritarians. That instinct is shakier in international affairs, but it shapes the way in which he views the world. With an image of American industrial and military power that is rooted in the world of several generations ago, he has enormous confidence in American strength and therefore assumes that bullying is preferable to negotiation, unless you are up against someone who is as tough as you, even if less muscle-bound.

He knows what he hates in foreign affairs—the mealymouthed multilateralism of the Biden administration, its catering to deadbeat allies, and its weakness in fleeing Afghanistan. He likewise despises the caterwauling about liberal values and democracy and the long-term military commitments of the George W. Bush administration. Indeed, although he cannot get over Joe Biden—Trump’s insecurities and grievances about the 2020 election and the various prosecutions he has faced between then and now prohibit it—from a foreign-policy point of view, he is at least as anti–George W. Bush as he is anti-Biden. And he despises the reverence for deliberate decision making, consultation with experts, and the willingness to engage in the conventional diplomacy that characterizes both. He views talk of international leadership, much less its practice, as claptrap.

Above all, he has three principal instruments in foreign policy: tariffs and kindred economic sanctions, brief bombing campaigns, and commando raids. He has no tolerance for bloody battles, which is why he will not authorize an Arctic amphibious campaign that faces real opposition. If he is going to negotiate, he will use friends such as Steven Witkoff and family members such as Jared Kushner, who might have an eye for lucrative deals that will enrich the United States and privileged relatives and friends. Nothing wrong with greed-driven foreign policy, in his view.

For Trump, foreign policy is a game of checkers (he does not have the temperament for chess) played one move at a time. The notion of reputational damage is alien to someone whose image was long ago tarnished beyond repair by grifting, lying, bullying, and double-dealing. He surely thinks nothing of the price that Iranian demonstrators (and ultimately the United States) may pay for having promised assistance and then shrugged it off with the claim that the Iranian regime has stopped killing people. (It has not; it just now does so in a way that Trump can claim he cannot see.)

If Trump were a poker player, he would bluff half the time. But games may be the wrong metaphor to understand him, because unless he is up against Xi Jinping and possibly Vladimir Putin, he struggles with the idea that other people have agency. In 2015, a senior politician who knew Trump well described to me a small dinner he attended at Mar-a-Lago. Trump ordered for each guest; from his point of view, the menu and their wishes were irrelevant.

These last two qualities explain many of his failures thus far, with more to come. Chess players who think only a single move ahead invariably lose; states and peoples, even quite small ones, have agency. Not only that, they can read him—the only question is whether they have the guts and competence to stare him down, or the wiliness to outmaneuver him.

He has, for example, put Turkey and Qatar on the Board of Peace that will supposedly run Gaza—without anyone, other than the Israeli military, actually willing to take on Hamas gunmen. The Israelis are furious that two hostile countries have been placed in that position. They are likely to acquiesce formally and to undermine their efforts privately. Trump thinks he can run Venezuela by remote control, but the head of ExxonMobil recently pointed out to him that until the country has something like rule of law and reasonable security, rebuilding its oil industry is not going to be possible. He continues to threaten Canada, and Prime Minister Mark Carney flies to Beijing. Volodymyr Zelensky was supposed to bow to Trump’s wishes. Instead, the Ukrainians, with help from Europe, adroitly manipulated a supposed agreement with Russia on ending the war into a proposal that Putin will not accept.

Having a president conducting foreign policy who thinks in this way—who fantasizes about a fleet of battleships named after him and a dome as golden as the Oval Office spreading over North America, who believes he can rename the Gulf of Mexico and that it will stick after he has left office—is undoubtedly scary. But there is some comfort in it as well.

In politics, gravity still works. A man entering his ninth decade has diminishing energy and stamina, and so Trump drowses off in meetings. He has excluded all but sycophants from his inner circle, and so he hears only his version of the truth. He faces the likely loss of the House of Representatives (at least) within a year. Little cracks are visibly spreading in the unwieldy coalition that only he could create, while even populists grow uneasy at the outlandish thuggery of Kristi Noem’s masked green-shirts. Indeed, he may find himself dealing at home with bloody insurgencies of the kind he hoped to avoid abroad if he persists in allowing Stephen Miller to press for the indiscriminate roundups of immigrants, or merely people who speak Spanish or have brown skin. His successors are already jostling one another.

This era will leave lasting foreign-policy damage. One Trump term could look like a fluke; two will certainly convince many abroad that the United States has become unreliable and even dangerous. But this emergence of a new, more transactional, and less peaceful world is unfortunately something that Trump has only accelerated, not created. His hopefully wiser and more sober successors will call the Gulf of Mexico by its name and pry Trump’s name off the United States Institute of Peace. More important, they will need to figure out how to restore a modicum of decency, good judgment, and international leadership once he is gone; rebuilding America’s reputation, unfortunately, will be the work of a generation. Such pivots have happened before—in the 1940s and the 1980s, for example. Let’s hope they will happen again.

        <hr/>
        Stock markets fell on both sides of the Atlantic on Tuesday, with Wall Street suffering its worst day since October, as investor concerns persisted over the fallout from Donald Trump’s push for US control of Greenland.

The sell-off hit US stocks on the first day of trading in New York since Trump threatened new tariffs on eight European countries, after the market was closed for a public holiday on Monday. The S&P 500 closed down 2.1% while the Dow Jones finished down 1.8%.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 2.4%, with Amazon down 2.9% and Tesla and Nvidia both off more than 3%, wiping billions of dollars off their market values.

The UK’s FTSE 100 index dropped 0.7% on Tuesday, after a smaller fall on Monday.

In Europe, France’s CAC was down 0.6%, Germany’s DAX fell 1% and Italy’s FTSE MIB was off 1.1%.

The dollar was down 0.9% against a basket of currencies.

Trump’s threat to increase tariffs on US imports of goods from Germany, France, Denmark, the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway and Finland have renewed economic uncertainty.

However, Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, played down the likelihood of a fresh trade war. Speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he gave a bullish defence of US tariff policies but suggested the outcome of what he called the “kerfuffle” over Greenland was be likely to be diplomacy.

“We are here to make a very clear point: globalisation has failed the west and the United States of America. It’s a failed policy. It is what the west has stood for, which is export, offshore, find the cheapest labour in the world, and the world is a better place for it. The fact is, it has left America behind. It has left American workers behind,” he said.

Lutnick argued that Trump uses tariffs as “a way for him to say: ‘Hey, you know, you need to talk to us.’ Do I think the trade deals that we’ve set with Europe, with the UK, are they durable? I absolutely do … What I see happening is diplomacy and talking and at the table, rather than action, which is something I think the president cares about.”

Sitting alongside Lutnick, the UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the UK was also interested in its economic security – but said the US should remember who its allies are.

“For all of your strengths, we do also need to preserve some of the things that the US has benefited from, in the Nato alliance, and the western alliance, not because it is the benevolent, because I believe it is in your country’s national interest.”

Reeves also urged people to keep cool heads as fears mount over Trump’s push for Greenland. “We absolutely want to de-escalate,” she told Bloomberg. “The future of Greenland is for the people of Greenland.”

Trump is scheduled to give a speech at Davos on Wednesday.

Earlier on Tuesday, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, also speaking at Davos, urged European countries not to retaliate against the US’s trade tariffs announced over the Greenland crisis.

Referring to Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs, announced in April, Bessent said: “I would say this is the same kind of hysteria that we heard on 2 April. There was a panic.

“What I am urging everyone here to do is sit back, take a deep breath, and let things play out. The worst thing countries can do is escalate against the United States.”

But Kathleen Brooks, a research director at the broker XTB, said Bessent had failed to calm investor nerves.

“Overall, this is a man-made crisis, and the continued sell-off on Tuesday suggests that US threats to Greenland and their effects on financial markets could have further to go if the situation does not de-escalate soon,” she said.

Gold and silver hit record highs as investors sought shelter from the market falls. Gold rose past $4,700 (£3,500) an ounce for the first time on Tuesday, and silver hit a fresh high of $95.52 an ounce.

Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday that eight European countries including the UK, France and Germany, will face tariffs “until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland”. The tariffs are due to start at 10% on 1 February, rising to 25% on 1 June.

Trump also added further uncertainty to global trade overnight by threatening to impose 200% tariffs on French wines and champagne after France’s Emmanuel Macron was reported to be unwilling to join his Gaza “board of peace”.

        <hr/>
        NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose again Thursday and regained more of their losses for the week following the latest walk back by President Donald Trump from tariffs he had earlier threatened.

The S&P 500 gained 0.5% and added to its big gain from Wednesday, when Trump said he had reached “the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland” and called off 10% tariffs for European countries that he said opposed his having the Arctic island. The index has recovered most of the losses it took after Trump shook financial markets with his initial tariff threat.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 306 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.9%.

It’s the latest example of Trump making a big, initial threat, only to pull back after seeing how much pain it created in financial markets. The pattern has led to the “TACO” acronym, suggesting that “Trump Always Chickens Out” if markets react strongly enough. Tuesday’s drop for the U.S. stock market was the worst since October and large enough that Trump, who often takes credit when Wall Street is doing well, acknowledged “the dip.”

But the pattern has also led to deals for Trump that outsiders may have initially considered unlikely if not for his market-shaking opening moves.

Details are still sparse about the framework of a deal on Greenland that Trump said he reached with the head of NATO. And it is not a signed deal yet.

Financial markets were still showing some signs of nervousness on Thursday. Gold’s price swiveled between small losses and gains before turning 1.6% higher. Its price often rises when investors are looking for something safer to own. The value of the U.S. dollar also weakened against the euro and several other foreign currencies.

But Treasury yields held relatively steady in a signal that foreign investors weren’t rushing out of the U.S. bond market.

Yields got some support from reports on the U.S. economy’s strength that came in better than expected. One said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected in a potential signal that the pace of layoffs remains low. A second suggested the U.S. economy grew at a faster rate during the summer than the government initially estimated.

A third said that inflation in November was close to economists’ expectations, while spending by U.S. consumers was a touch better than expected.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed as high as 4.28% following the reports, but it later eased to 4.25% from 4.26% late Wednesday.

On Wall Street, Northern Trust climbed 6% after reporting a stronger profit for the end of 2025 than analysts expected. CEO Michael O’Grady also said that the financial services company is entering 2026 with “strong momentum across all our businesses.”

Procter & Gamble added 2.6% after likewise delivering a better profit than analysts expected. Revenue for the company behind the Downy, Pantene and Tide brands, though, fell just shy of expectations amid what CEO Shailesh Jejurikar called a “challenging consumer and geopolitical environment.”

Shares of BitGo, a company that helps crypto businesses and traditional financial firms hold and manage digital assets, rose 2.7% in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange. The company priced its stock at $18 per share in its initial public offering, above its earlier estimated range of $15 to $17.

JPMorgan Chase rose 0.5% after a lawsuit filed by Trump against the bank caused minor ripples for its stock. Trump accused JPMorgan Chase of closing his accounts for political reasons after he left office in 2021.

They helped offset an 8.1% drop for spice seller McCormick & Co., whose profit fell short of expectations. CEO Brendan Foley said it continues to face rising costs because of “a shifting global trade environment.”

All told, the S&P 500 rose 37.73 points to 6,913.35. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 306.78 to 49,384.01, and the Nasdaq composite gained 211.20 to 23,436.02.

In stock markets abroad, indexes climbed across Europe and Asia amid relief on Trump’s walk back of tariffs.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7%, and Germany’s DAX returned 1.2% for two of the world’s bigger moves.

Global markets also got support from a continued easing of long-term yields in Japan’s bond market. They had spiked early in the week on worries that Japan’s popular prime minister could make moves that would add heavily to the government’s already big debt.

But the 40-year Japanese government bond yield has come back since hitting a record and dropped below 4% on Thursday after hitting 4.22% on Tuesday.

        <hr/>
        On Tuesday, stock and bond markets fell sharply—then rebounded on Wednesday and Thursday, following US President Donald Trump’s statements at Davos on Greenland. The first signs of stress this week, however, did not originate in Switzerland or the United States, but in the Japanese bond market. There, a snap election called by Prime Minister Takaichi Sanae sparked expectations of a spending spree, reviving debt sustainability concerns. That early tremor set the tone. By the time trading moved west, fears of a breakdown in the transatlantic relationship mounted, particularly after Trump threatened additional tariffs on countries unwilling to support a US acquisition of Greenland.

The S&P 500 dropped 2 percent, the dollar weakened, and Treasury yields rose to their highest level since September. While it’s rare for stocks and bonds to fall sharply on the same day, a similar pattern last emerged in April and was seen as one of the reasons why the Trump administration ultimately deferred its “Liberation Day” tariffs.

It was a stark contrast to last week, when we were scratching our heads as to why Wall Street barely reacted to escalating tensions involving Venezuela and Iran, or the Department of Justice’s investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. There are plenty of reasons why this might be. For one, the capture of strongman Nicolás Maduro and protests in Iran, however dramatic politically, did not pose an immediate threat to global trade flows or major supply chains. Meanwhile, had Trump followed through on his tariff threats, it would likely have marked the end of the United States-European Union trade deal, which was only announced in July 2025 and has since become a partial model for other countries negotiating with the Trump administration.

Why markets have shrugged off most shocks

Over the past decade, markets have weathered a steady stream of geoeconomic shocks—Brexit, trade wars, sanctions, pandemics, and bank failures, to name only a few. And yet, nothing has truly shaken investor confidence. The chart below shows eight major shocks since 2016 and highlights in red the few that coincided with a market contraction of more than 20 percent, triggering a bear market in the United States.

The common thread among those truly market-shaking moments is that they posed a direct disruption to the global economy: supply chains seizing up, trade flows collapsing, or energy prices spiking. But once a credible signal of stabilization emerged—whether through vaccine rollouts or a temporary ninety-day tariff pause—Wall Street quickly went back to business. That is, in part, because markets have internalized a powerful lesson: look past the immediate headlines. Investors have learned that most shocks inflict far less lasting damage than initially feared. That belief has become a guiding heuristic.

This week, however, investors responded forcefully to the renewed risk of a trade war between the United States and the European Union. The transatlantic economic relationship is far denser than the ties between Washington and Caracas or Tehran, totaling roughly $1.5 trillion in goods and services trade in 2024. A sustained escalation would have struck at the core of global commerce. Had tensions continued to rise, there was a real risk that market reactions would have intensified. Instead, as Trump pulled back from his tariff threats on Wednesday, markets recovered swiftly.

The dangers of taking volatility for granted

The risk of the markets adopting a “nothing ever happens” mentality is that it lowers sensitivity to increased political volatility. There are plenty of reasonable explanations for why the Trump administration’s investigation of the Federal Reserve chair failed to move markets, while the prospect of economic conflict with the world’s largest trading bloc has. One reason may be that the issue of central bank independence in the United States has not yet crossed the threshold from concern to crisis, which investors seem to require for a reaction. But if the job of markets is to look ahead and price future risks, then Wall Street may be too complacent about the accumulating cost of shocks.

At a rally in Detroit earlier this month, Donald Trump told the crowd that his upcoming speech at the World Economic Forum would tackle one of his core issues: affordability. But the address he delivered in Davos yesterday was not quite what he’d telegraphed.

In what my colleague David A. Graham described as a “stump speech,” the president strayed from that focus, roaming from Arctic defense to the Minnesota fraud scandal to the policies of “Sleepy” Joe Biden. When he returned to the topic of affordability, he claimed that grocery prices are “going down” (they’re not) and that drug prices have declined by “2,000 percent” (they haven’t). Although Trump campaigned on the economy, weak polling has recently spurred new plans to make life in America more affordable.

At one point, Trump plugged a plan to curb predatory lending practices by capping credit-card interest rates at 10 percent—but the deadline (proposed on Truth Social) for the policy to go into effect had passed the day before. Trump also used his speech to promote his plan to lower housing costs, which he recently unveiled in an executive order. The policy is aimed at preventing corporations from buying up single-family homes, and has bipartisan support. These proposals were a blip in his 80-minute speech before he quickly pivoted.

Trump has lately been laser-focused on foreign policy. Nearly three weeks ago, U.S. troops captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and brought him to New York for trial. Since then, Trump has flirted with military action in Iran and attempted to bully Denmark into giving up Greenland, threatening a sweeping new tariff strategy that—had Trump not reneged yesterday—could have raised costs for Americans.

When Trump and his officials have talked about the economy, their comments have been confusing. The White House’s insistence that consumer goods are, in fact, affordable has so far not connected with many Americans, for whom high prices are still top of mind. In an attempt to underscore how cheap supermarkets have supposedly become, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said last week that “it can cost around $3 a meal for a piece of chicken, a piece of broccoli, you know, a corn tortilla, and one other thing.” After being criticized online for appearing out of touch, she clarified that $15.64 was the more accurate figure, based on “almost 1,000 simulations,” for “three full square meals and a snack.” (I have some follow-up questions: What’s that “other thing”? And what constitutes a “square” meal?)

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also faced blowback from observers and Democratic politicians this week after suggesting in an interview that “mom and pop” homebuyers are snapping up “five, 10, 12 homes” for retirement. And at a rally in Ohio earlier today, Vice President Vance compared the American economy to a doomed enterprise: “You don’t turn the Titanic around overnight,” he said. Trump has blamed “bad public-relations people” for failing to sell his affordability message—but the problem could also have to do with these sorts of gaffes.

The president’s inconsistent messaging may play a role too. Before the holidays, he held a rally in Pennsylvania as part of his “affordability tour”—an effort to shift Americans’ perspectives on the economy. His address included a digression about why the Democrats’ emphasis on affordability was a “hoax,” how Representative Ilhan Omar “does nothing but bitch,” and why Americans don’t need so many pencils. His speech at the Detroit Economic Club included a few diversions but was overall more targeted. “The Trump economic boom has officially begun,” he said.

Trump is right that the economy is showing signs of health. Unemployment is low, and the stock market is on a tear. But these metrics don’t reveal the whole picture. The economy is adding fewer jobs even as inflation remains under control. The Atlantic contributing writer John Dickerson recently pointed out that “aggregate gains mask uneven distribution, and many workers really are seeing their purchasing power erode.” If Trump’s attempts to interfere with the Federal Reserve’s independence prove successful, they could unleash even more economic uncertainty. “Trump is hardly the first president to cherry-pick numbers and accentuate the positive,” Dickerson wrote. “But his argument is weak because he has to overcome people’s lived experience.”

Despite his constant jabs at his predecessor, Trump is in some sense following in Biden’s footsteps. “Bidenomics” fell flat as a slogan in part because Biden’s rosy view of the economy didn’t connect with voters facing ever-higher inflation. When Trump and his team aren’t shutting down criticism of the economy, they’re simply distracted. Neither communicates to Americans that their struggles are understood.

The Sciencewashing of Everyday Life

By Ellen Cushing

There’s a double helix in my local Sephora. It’s roughly the size and shape of a soda can, and it is accompanied by a placard referencing patents and peptides, as if in a science fair. It’s trying to sell me a hair mask.

Online, the company responsible for this display describes itself as a “biology-first haircare brand, powered by biotech.” It practices “biomimetic hairscience,” and, thanks to “a decade of complex research into the bioscience of hair,” has patented a peptide that repairs hair “at a molecular level across multiple types of bonds including polypeptide chains and disulfide bonds.” I have no idea what any of this means. The mask costs $75.

In 2026, it is possible to cover your body in science.

María-Elena Pombo has created “petroleum weavings,” turning threads made from oil into elaborate yarnlike wall hangings. Oil, she told us, has shaped her life. Her father, an oil engineer, met her mother after he moved to Cabimas, an oil town. Because of Venezuela’s oil wealth, Pombo, now 37 years old, studied for free at an excellent public university in Caracas.

For decades, all Venezuelans enjoyed the perks of living in a land where oil was a birthright. They could fill their cars for almost nothing. Education and other public services were heavily subsidized as well. Academics might argue over the wisdom of the state’s largesse. But people expected, at the very least, affordable gas as a material benefit from the nation’s abundance of oil.

President Trump’s military intervention in Venezuela this month was, in part, a bid to seize the source of this wealth. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world. Trump made no secret of his desire to exploit them in what many have criticized as an act of naked imperialism and the theft of Venezuela’s economic patrimony: “We’re going to be using oil, and we’re going to be taking oil,” Trump said in an interview after the January 3 attack that captured the strongman President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.

Yet many Venezuelans in the country and abroad celebrated the strike. María Corina Machado, the popular leader of the opposition, has welcomed Trump’s actions. Last February, Machado was a guest on Donald Trump Jr.’s podcast. When he asked why Americans should care about Venezuela, her first response was: “Oil and gas.” Machado’s strategy could appear to have been a devil’s bargain—tempting Trump with the prospect of petrodollars in exchange for ousting Maduro, her nemesis. But her feelings reflected something broader, too: Venezuelans who once viewed oil as a source of wealth and pride, a limitless resource that had shaped their identity and set their country apart from its poorer neighbors, have come to view it more as a curse.

Venezuelans in the past two decades have watched as the regime squandered the wealth that oil had created, let the country’s oil infrastructure rot, removed gasoline subsidies, and welcomed a bigger hand from Cuba, bartering oil for professionals and intelligence operatives from Havana. Pombo says her generation is the last that benefited from oil. Today, the university where she studied is in such a sorry state that the roof of one of its buildings collapsed. In the former boomtown of Cabimas, in northwestern Venezuela, people grew so desperate that they jury-rigged refineries in their own backyards because gasoline had become so scarce and expensive.

By that measure, ceding the oil industry to the United States at least holds the promise of importing industrial know-how with some financial benefit for the country. A poll by The Economist found that a majority of Venezuelans “somewhat” or “strongly” supported the capture of Maduro and were optimistic about their economic prospects. Fewer than 35 percent thought that the Venezuelan government should continue running Venezuela’s oil industry. Or as Sary Levy-Carciente, Machado’s economic adviser, put it to us, the Americans will be “better clients.”

At a ranch in Cabimas one day in 1922, local farmers were awoken by a bang followed by a black rain. Workers for Shell, an Anglo-Dutch company, had been poking holes in the ground, looking for oil—and struck it rich. A plume spouted for many days. Some viewed the discovery as a divine gift, while a local priest chastised the explorers for unearthing Satan, saying the blowout was God’s punishment. Word traveled northward, and the Rockefellers of Standard Oil and the Mellons of Gulf Oil saw a business opportunity. The episode ushered in more than a half century of relative prosperity.

Even then, some saw signs of trouble. In the 1930s, Arturo Úslar Pietri, an influential intellectual and historian, argued in an essay that the country needed to “sow the oil” by investing oil profits to cultivate other industries. Generation after generation of schoolchildren have heard these words repeated as advice that the country should have followed but didn’t. Instead of sowing the oil, Venezuela became dependent on it.

American companies arrived to drill the wells and build the fields. They brought with them country clubs and baseball. The companies made deals with whichever military despot was in power in Caracas, angering young intellectuals such as Rómulo Betancourt, who harbored dreams of a democratic Venezuela. In his writings, he condemned “the aggressive, juvenile impetus of North American capitalism” and advocated for Venezuelans to be the owners of their oil.

Betancourt became president through a coup in 1945, putting him in position to fulfill his goal of a democratic constitution. But he exercised caution over oil. He didn’t kick out the Americans but instead persuaded them to pay more. He then used those proceeds to build schools, hospitals, and roads. Starting in 1948, American companies extracted the oil and gave roughly half of the profits to the Venezuelan state, an arrangement known as el fifty-fifty.

Betancourt’s stance that Venezuela resented America but needed America is reflected in Miguel Otero Silva’s 1961 novel, Oficina No. 1. The story follows pious, rural Venezuelans who leave everything behind to move to a nameless town where newly arrived Americans are extracting oil with little foresight or planning. The Trinidadian driver who takes the Venezuelans to the fields sings a song in English, as if warning about the type of people the Americans are: “After Johnny eats my food, / After Johnny drinks my rhum, / After Johnny wears my clothes, / Johnny comes back and takes my wife.” But the Venezuelans pay him no mind. They moved to a town with no name because that was their best hope.

Yet many Venezuelans idealize this period. The years of el fifty-fifty were some of the most prosperous in Venezuelan history—a time when migrants were eager to come to Venezuela, rather than leave it, as they have in droves more recently. Hundreds of thousands from Europe and elsewhere arrived for the glorious tropical climate, golden Caribbean beaches, and plentiful job opportunities. The possibilities felt limitless. The country built some of the world’s most futuristic highways and was early in eradicating malaria. When Christian Dior decided to open his first shop in Latin America, he opened it in Caracas. The Concorde, that majestic superfast airplane, flew in at least once a week. Oil was the draw that brought the world to Venezuela. Even Venezuela’s shanties were made with solid construction materials such as brick and concrete, made cheap by a strong bolivar, Venezuela’s currency. It was not uncommon to see new cars parked outside. And although the Venezuelan poor could not afford the shopping trips that the country’s rich made to Miami, they could go to Margarita—a Venezuelan island famous for its beaches and low tax rates.

By 1976, however, Venezuela’s political class had tired of el fifty-fifty. The government seized the assets of American companies and nationalized the oil industry, creating a state-owned giant Petróleos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA.

For years, the company thrived. José Guerra, a Venezuelan economist, told us that graduates aspired to land PDVSA jobs. (He didn’t make the cut as a young man, and had to settle for a job at the central bank.) The government funded scholarships so that the best and brightest could study abroad and become PDVSA engineers and managers. For Luis Soler, who worked at PDVSA for 30 years, the company represented a certain idea of meritocracy. It had an American-style work environment complete with 9-to-5 workdays and a corporate ladder for promotion. “We had discipline, values,” he said.

By the 1990s, PDVSA had become one of the largest and most influential state-owned oil companies in the world, second only to Aramco, its Saudi counterpart. Venezuelan leaders proved to themselves that they could competently manage the country’s oil.

Yet as Pietri had predicted more than a half century before, the country had failed to spread the wealth sufficiently to bolster other industries. “We just traded it! We traded it, and for what? Cars from the United States, whiskey from Scotland, fabrics from Italy, perfumes from France,” Rafael Quiroz, an oil economist at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas, told us. “And as time passed, we didn’t build anything. We didn’t use the oil to make an economy.”

Those outside the circle of PDVSA profits grew resentful. Seeds had been sown, but not for broad economic growth, as Pietri had once hoped, but for revolution.

The socialist Hugo Chávez came to power in 1999 and managed PDVSA for priorities other than maximum profits. He replaced thousands of highly trained company employees with party loyalists. And for the first decade of the 21st century, the state used oil as a tool of diplomacy, with Chávez lavishing petrodollars on tiny island nations whose votes he courted in the Organization of American States, a regional diplomatic forum. Venezuela replaced Russia as Cuba’s main oil supplier, a favor that Cuban President Fidel Castro returned by becoming Chávez’s mentor on authoritarianism. The consequences of the mismanagement were profound. A country that fully depended on oil became ill-equipped to produce it. After the oil boom, Venezuela somehow ended up poorer, beset by corruption and hyperinflation.

When Chávez died, in 2013, Maduro inherited a failing oil industry and did little to improve it. By 2020, Venezuela’s refineries had crumbled to the point that the country had to start importing gasoline from Iran. Even during the worst years of a humanitarian crisis, Maduro continued supplying his friends in the Cuban government with oil. (In January, the U.S. assault to capture Maduro killed 32 Cuban officers on the president’s security detail.) Venezuela now produces only about 1 percent of the oil in the world, a mere 1 million barrels a day.

The perception that Maduro gave away oil to keep himself in power has made some Venezuelans more comfortable with the idea of giving oil to America, the country that got rid of the strongman. “Venezuela is going from having a government controlled by Cuba to having a government controlled by the United States,” the historian Pedro Benítez told us, adding that the U.S. can help with the huge investments needed to revive the oil industry.

The rise of Machado is its own testament to changing attitudes about oil. Of all the opposition leaders, Machado has spoken most consistently in favor of privatization and foreign investment. For a long time, these preferences made her relatively unpopular. But in recent years, her views have spread widely. Many Venezuelans would have liked to see Machado replace Maduro as part of a transition back to democratic government. But so far, the Trump administration has shown little interest in that, preferring instead to work with Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro’s vice president, and the rest of the regime. Like Betancourt, she portrays the United States as an unwelcome imperial power: “Enough of Washington’s orders to Venezuelan politicians,” she said on Sunday. But when it comes to oil, she’s ready to deal. In a speech before legislators this month, she said that she would proceed with an “agenda of cooperation” nonetheless. “Let’s not be afraid of contradictions,” she said.

American companies are poised to develop Venezuela’s oil industry anew. Trump said this month that Venezuela would provide 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., and that the sale of this oil would “benefit the people” of both nations. Rodríguez said that Venezuela had received $300 million from the sale, the first payments from those barrels. She celebrated the country’s much-needed share of the revenue.

Trump sees a fresh era of American investment from the oil giants of today. He recently hosted the chief executives from the major U.S. oil firms at the White House to pitch them on the prospect. But the challenges are legion, including the need for political stability in both Venezuela and the U.S. There are no guarantees that a new American administration would take the same tack as Trump. And although working with the regime has brought its country near-term calm—Venezuela is secured right now by pro-government militias—the Trump administration has spoken about an eventual political transition. This leaves Caracas in a governing limbo and U.S. companies wary. Only a stable government can provide sufficient security for the companies to commit to long-term investments.

Over time, the key power brokers in Venezuela may splinter over their new fifty-fifty-style deal with the U.S. “The current arrangement is unlikely to be convenient at the same time for all of them. One of them or some of them will try to change it,” Jana Nelson, a top Pentagon official on Western Hemisphere affairs during the Biden administration, told us.

Even so, many in Venezuela seem guardedly optimistic. Guerra, the former central-bank official, used to be critical of the opposition for courting a U.S. intervention, but he’s now bullish about the economy. He envisions the U.S. government placing conditions on how the regime can spend future oil revenues to make sure the nation’s natural wealth is used to revive Venezuela.

We pointed out that this scenario rests on the assumption that Trump cares about the fate of Venezuela and its people. “Well, we cannot assume anything else,” Guerra told us. The Venezuelan people, he added, are “just onlookers, not actors. We are just looking at what’s happening, hoping for the best. We don’t get to determine anything.”

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Internal divisions and a fractured chain of command have created significant dysfunction within the Department of Homeland Security as leadership figures clash over the administration's mass-deportation plans. Following a controversial fatal shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis, a power struggle between DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott has led President Trump to sideline Noem in favor of 'border czar' Tom Homan, who will now oversee operations in Minnesota directly.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appeared before a bank of television cameras in Washington, D.C., on Saturday night to blame the man who had been shot to death by federal agents in Minneapolis that morning for his own death, claiming without evidence that he had intended “to kill law enforcement” and had been “brandishing” a weapon. Behind her stood the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Rodney Scott, sending a silent message of unity.

But behind the scenes, the senior ranks of the Department of Homeland Security were divided. Until minutes before they walked in front of the cameras, Noem and Scott had not spoken to each other that day, even as Noem took charge of her department’s response to the shooting and coordinated with the White House and other officials in Scott’s agency, two people familiar with their interactions told us.

Donald Trump has said over the years that he welcomes and even encourages rivalries in his administration, and delights in watching aides compete to please him. But for the past year, the president has allowed a rift to widen within the team tasked with delivering on the mass-deportation plan that is his most important domestic-policy initiative. That has led to months of acrimony and left many veteran officials at DHS—including those who support the president’s deportation goals—astonished at the dysfunction.

The president’s crackdown has adopted an improvisational approach, not an institutional one, with blurred leadership roles and no clear chain of command. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has been holding daily conference calls pressuring DHS and other federal agencies to prioritize immigration arrests and deportations above all other objectives. Noem and her de facto chief of staff, Corey Lewandowski, who has been working at DHS as a “special government employee,” have aggressively tried to meet Miller’s demands and use the department’s advertising budgets and social-media accounts to promote anti-immigrant messaging. They have worked around Tom Homan, the White House “border czar,” who has had little role in operations, instead dispatching a second-tier Border Patrol official named Gregory Bovino to sweep through cities led by Democrats. Bovino told his superiors that he reported directly to Noem, not to Scott—who wanted his agents to go back to protecting U.S. borders, and has struggled to maintain control of his own agency.

This story about the infighting around Trump is based on interviews with 12 people familiar with the tensions inside DHS, including senior administration officials, most of whom requested anonymity to speak frankly about internal events. “The President’s entire immigration enforcement team are on the same page,” the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote to us in response.

Scott and Homan declined to comment. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for DHS, told us that Noem’s Saturday comments on the shooting were based on CBP reports “from a very chaotic scene.” McLaughlin added, “We are not going to spend time giving any oxygen to these anonymous accounts.”

When Noem and Scott stepped before the cameras on Saturday, Noem appeared to have the upper hand. But the balance of power has since shifted. Frustrated by the bipartisan backlash to Alex Pretti’s death, Trump announced on Monday that Homan would take over the operation in Minnesota. Bovino has been stripped of his “commander” role and sent back to his old job on the border in El Centro, California. Seemingly well aware of the divides around him, Trump announced that he was removing Noem from the chain of command in Minnesota. “Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,” Trump said.

When Homan spoke to reporters today, with Scott standing behind him, he tried striking a conciliatory tone and that he’d arrived to make changes in federal operations. “I didn’t come to Minnesota for photo ops or headlines,” he said. Homan urged Minnesota leaders to give ICE more access to detainees in local jails, and said he’d withdraw federal forces if cooperation improves.

Homan and Scott arrived in the state Monday with orders to de-escalate tensions in Minneapolis, which Trump has flooded with 3,000 federal agents—the largest Homeland Security deployment in history. That same day, Noem and Lewandowski went to the White House for a two-hour meeting with the president and some of his top aides, but not with Miller. The following day, Trump said that he had come to share the concerns of Scott and Homan, saying that it was normal for him to “shake up teams.”

“You know, Bovino is very good, but he’s a pretty out-there kind of a guy,” Trump told Fox News. “And in some cases that’s good; maybe it wasn’t good here.”

But the battle inside the agency continued. Scott sent an email to senior officials at CBP on Monday reminding them that he was in charge of the agency and that they report to him, according to two people familiar with the document. Yesterday, the DHS general counsel James Percival notified CBP employees to disregard the email because it had not gone through legal review, the people told us.

The split between the two factions is not ideological. Homan and Scott are no less hard-line on border and immigration enforcement than Noem and Lewandowski are. Homan—who was an architect of the family-separation policy during Trump’s first term—wants to ramp up deportations with more ICE officers, detention capacity, and deportation flights, but without the social-media trolling and the show-me-your-papers approach to fishing for deportees in American cities.

Both men worked their way up through the ranks of their agencies. They represent an institutional wing of MAGA that wants to pursue the president’s deportation goals using existing chain-of-command structures and the conventional division of labor, in which the Border Patrol guards the border and ICE handles immigration arrests in U.S. cities, usually aiming to minimize disruption. They also have the backing of many career officials at DHS who told us that they see Noem’s approach as ad hoc, performative, and possibly motivated by her own political ambitions, with Lewandowski pulling the strings. At DHS headquarters in southeast Washington, staffers address Lewandowski as “chief” even though he doesn’t have an actual title there, three current officials told us.

Allies of Noem, meanwhile, have decided that Homan and Scott are bureaucratic dinosaurs who are unable to achieve the president’s objectives. They have tried to satisfy the demands of Miller, who runs immigration policy inside Trump’s orbit and functions as the actual “czar” of the president’s deportation campaign. Miller has set aggressive benchmarks for using the $170 billion in ICE and CBP funding included in Trump’s budget bill last year, telling ICE officials to make 3,000 immigration arrests a day to hit the White House target of 1 million deportations a year. Noem put CBP officials in charge of ICE offices and diverted highly trained investigative agents from trafficking cases and drug cartels to make immigration arrests on city streets.

The killings of Pretti and Renee Good this month have been the two most politically damaging events in a wider, militarized show of force that has turned Trump’s best-polling issue into a political liability. Noem has spent more than $200 million on advertising to promote the deportation campaign, but it has instead been defined largely by images of excess: toddlers being taken into custody, U.S. citizens being yanked from their cars, Bovino’s masked commandos storming a Chicago apartment building after rappelling from a Black Hawk helicopter.

“Memes don’t win the media narrative. Professionalism does,” a veteran official critical of Noem and her team told us. Another former DHS official told us that Trump’s mass-deportation goals have been held back in the process. “Look at the whole thing playing out in Minnesota,” the former official said. “A lot of the controversy and negative optics could have been avoided—and are avoided in other locations—if not for Corey and the secretary.”

Allies of Homan and Scott believe that a reckoning may be coming. “Lewandowski messed up by going to war with Rodney Scott and deploying Bovino to the interior,” one senior DHS official told us. “There is no one at DHS with higher credentials than Scott, and sidelining him for petty reasons distracts from POTUS missions.”

Critics of Scott who spoke with us argue that he lacks the focus and drive to achieve the president’s priorities, spends too much time in meetings that don’t end in decisions, and is failing to do enough to drive the president’s top priority of finishing the border wall. They say that he had little involvement in the CBP deployment to Minnesota and other cities, and did not visit the state to meet with commanders on the ground until this week. “He is not a team player,” one Homeland Security official told us of Scott. “I really think Rodney is kind of on an island.”

During the meeting with Trump on Monday, Noem spoke at length about her concerns with the slow pace of border-wall construction, according to a person briefed on the conversation. Since the start of Trump’s second term, only about 24 miles of wall have been built, including replacement sections, the person said. Noem has made clear that she holds Scott responsible.

“The president was very focused on the status of the wall,” the official said. “The president is pissed.”

The breakdown that led to this week’s shift inside DHS dates back months. Noem lacks the ability to fire Scott, who was confirmed by the Senate, so she has had to get creative. Late last year, her deputies forced Scott to fire several of his senior staff, moves that were recently reported by the Washington Examiner. Scott’s chief of staff was then promoted, and Noem’s office selected a replacement. After Joseph N. Mazzara, an attorney working in Noem’s office, was installed as CBP deputy commissioner, Scott attempted to reclaim control of his agency.

In a memo sent on January 6, described to us by four people familiar with its contents, Scott asked senior leadership at CBP to report to his office any contact they had with “special government employees”—a request that many interpreted as an effort to curtail the influence of Lewandowski. Within hours, the DHS general counsel James Percival had objected to the memo, as had the White House counsel’s office. A White House official told us that the involvement of the White House counsel followed a normal practice of engaging with general counsels at government departments on “issues of common concern.”

Despite the pushback, Scott’s office issued a second memo later that day to senior CBP officials: They should log any communications with officials outside the agency, including senior DHS and White House officials. Both memos were ultimately rescinded after legal pushback from DHS and the White House counsel, these people told us. Scott’s fumbled attempts to curtail outside influence on his agency raised further concerns at DHS headquarters about his leadership. “You don’t get to this level where you jump on your horse and play cowboy like that,” one person familiar with the events told us.

Days later, Scott found his credibility publicly under attack. Politico reported that top brass in Noem’s office had objected to plans for a $2.1 million office refurbishment at CBP headquarters in Washington. (Renovation questions are known to get the president’s attention. Just days earlier, the Justice Department had launched an investigation into the chairman of the Federal Reserve and a $2.5 billion renovation he was overseeing.) The Office of Management and Budget, in a move that has not been previously reported, began asking CBP about the plans, exploring whether they violated the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits spending that contradicts congressional appropriations, according to three people familiar with the outreach.

On the same day that the Politico article was published, Miller gathered agency leaders at the White House to discuss the administration’s success in spending funds appropriated with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Scott told those gathered that starting on February 1, wall construction would speed up dramatically. Others in the department doubt he will be able to achieve his new goals.

A veteran official involved with the border-wall project told us that contracting rules imposed by Lewandowski last summer—which require Noem’s signature on any contract or modification exceeding $100,000—have slowed the pace of construction. The funding bill provides nearly $50 billion for the border wall (10 times the amount that triggered a congressional shutdown in late 2018), and the official estimated that more than two-thirds of the contracts are worth $100,000 or more.

Noem’s team says that this is false, contending that she quickly approves contracts and that CBP has not yet awarded all of the prime contracts for construction. “None of this is on Noem,” the DHS official told us.

In recent weeks, DHS officials have discussed hiring a management contractor to oversee the planning and construction of the border wall, replacing senior officials at CBP. The idea has faced some resistance because it would echo an effort undertaken by former President George W. Bush in 2006, when his administration hired Boeing, a defense contractor and commercial-airplane manufacturer, to oversee $2.5 billion in spending on border security. By 2010, CBP’s inspector general was reporting that the agency had failed to properly manage the contract, which was dogged by missed deadlines and cost overruns.

“Adults have arrived.” That’s how one DHS official deployed in Minneapolis described the appearance of Homan and Scott.

Homan began by meeting with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. “While we don’t agree on everything, these meetings were a productive starting point and I look forward to more conversations with key stakeholders in the days ahead,” Homan announced on social media afterward. Trump officials have been targeting the two men and other Democratic leaders in the state with a criminal investigation and possible obstruction charges. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, accused them of “terrorism” just two weeks ago.

Administration officials insist that the Minneapolis crackdown will continue, but they have started pulling Border Patrol agents out of the city. Homan is trying to compel Democratic leaders to ease local “sanctuary policies” and give ICE more access to local jails and immigrants with criminal records. Walz and other Minnesota leaders want the government to allow the state to conduct an investigation into Pretti’s killing.

Bovino’s return to his old job on the border leaves the administration without a field commander for the rolling conquest of blue cities that has defined its strategy since May. The White House has not clarified whether that approach will continue or whether Homan will now be in charge of the president’s wider removal campaign. But McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, announced that Noem is “very happy” to have Homan take over in Minnesota. “Her portfolio is really huge,” McLaughlin said.

When the 2018 family-separation policy became a political debacle, Trump officials scrambled to distance themselves. The same impulse is again on display. After previously championing Bovino’s efforts in Minnesota, Noem’s team has this week privately pointed to the arrest quotas pushed by Miller at the White House as a cause of the problems. Miller called Pretti an “assassin” within hours of the shooting. But on Tuesday, he suggested that the failure of the CBP team in Minneapolis to follow White House guidance may have played a role in Pretti’s death.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> The Department of Justice and the FBI have launched investigations into the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by Customs and Border Protection officers in Minnesota. Amidst massive anti-ICE protests and legal battles over federal immigration enforcement, the FBI has taken the lead on the probe originally handled by the Department of Homeland Security.

        <hr/>
        The Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting of Alex Pretti in Minnesota, US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Friday.

“All that that means is that (the Department of Homeland Security), as they’ve, as the Secretary has said, is conducting an investigation, as they should,” Blanche said. “And as they do every time there’s a tragic event like this, and the FBI, in their role which is a separate role from DHS, is also take looking into it and conducting investigation.”

CNN previously reported that the FBI is taking the lead on the investigation into Pretti, which was initially handled by DHS’s investigative agency.

The announcement means that the Justice Department is looking into whether the DHS officers who shot Pretti violated the law, and marks an expansion of the federal government’s investigation into the matter.

“The family’s focus is on a fair and impartial investigation that examines the facts around his murder,” an attorney for Pretti’s family, Steve Schleicher, said in a statement to CNN on Friday.

Customs and Border Protection are also conducting an internal probe on the officers who shot and killed Pretti.

Later on during Friday’s press conference, Blanche appeared to backtrack from his initial confirmation.

“I don’t want to overstate what’s happening,” Blanche said. “I don’t want the takeaway to be that there’s some massive civil rights investigation that’s happening.”

Blanche added that it was “a standard investigation by the FBI” and said that “when there’s circumstances like what we saw last Saturday, and that investigation, to the extent it needs to involve lawyers at the Civil Rights Division, it will involve those.”

The FBI is now leading the investigation into the shooting of Alex Pretti by Customs and Border Protection officers in Minnesota, taking over the investigation from the Department of Homeland Security’s investigative agency, HSI, a senior DHS official confirmed to CNN.

In the wake of the shooting, HSI took the lead on the investigation, with FBI providing support, including by initially processing Pretti’s firearm at a local laboratory. FBI Director Kash Patel has previously referred questions about the investigation to DHS.

On Fox News Thursday night, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem also said the FBI was leading the investigation.

This comes after White House aide Stephen Miller’s acknowledgement that “may not have been following” proper protocol before the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti.

It’s unclear what, exactly, the change means for the investigation and the FBI has, in the past, been the agency tasked with investigating such shootings along with local investigators.

“We will continue to follow the investigation that the FBI is leading,” Noem said Thursday, “and giving them all the information they need to bring that to conclusion – and make sure that the American people know the truth of that situation.”

As President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has whisked through major US cities, trial-level judges attempting to restrain the frenzied actions of federal agents have been repeatedly slapped down by higher courts – often with the help of judges the president put on the bench in his first term.

A series of rulings from the Supreme Court and federal appeals courts dominated by Trump nominees have overturned early victories secured by opponents of the immigration blitzes in California, Chicago and Minnesota.

The administration’s latest win came Monday, when a three-judge federal appeals court panel indefinitely paused a Minneapolis judge’s decision to put tight guardrails on how agents can respond to individuals peacefully protesting Operation Metro Surge, which has sparked intense opposition in the Twin Cities and led to the fatal shooting of two US citizens by federal officers.

Trump and his allies have long complained that lower court judges have acted out of bounds in cases challenging his agenda, particularly in the immigration context, over which they argue he has broad, unreviewable authority.

President Donald Trump said Thursday evening that there were no plans to pull immigration enforcement agents out of Minneapolis, after border czar Tom Homan announced earlier in the day he had ordered federal immigration authorities to work on a drawdown plan.

Asked if he’d be pulling back immigration agents, Trump said, “We’ll do whatever we can to keep our country safe.” Pressed again if he was not pulling back, Trump said, “No, no not at all.”

Trump’s comments — made at the premiere of first lady Melania Trump’s documentary at the Kennedy Center — followed Homan’s remarks that morning that he was working on a “draw down plan” to begin reducing the number of immigration agents in the state and insisted that upholding “public safety should be paramount.”

Speaking on the red carpet Thursday evening, Trump heaped praise on Homan, calling the border czar “terrific.”

“I think he’s terrific but we have to get rid of the criminals,” Trump said. “We have to take criminals out of our country so from that standpoint, nothing’s going to change.”

Press freedom groups are condemning the arrests of journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort in connection with their coverage of an anti-ICE protest inside a Minnesota church on January 18.

“These arrests under bogus legal theories for obviously constitutionally protected reporting are clear warning shots aimed at other journalists,” said Seth Stern, the chief of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation. “The unmistakable message is that journalists must tread cautiously because the government is looking for any way to target them.”

Stern told CNN: “The answer to this outrageous attack is not fear or self-censorship. It’s an even stronger commitment to journalism, the truth, and the First Amendment. If the Trump administration thinks it can bully journalists into submission, it is wrong.”

Katherine Jacobsen, the US, Canada and Caribbean program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, said Lemon’s arrest “should alarm all Americans.”

“As an international organization, we know that the treatment of journalists is an indicator of the condition of a country’s democracy. The United States is doing poorly,” Jacobsen said.

Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the nonprofit advocacy group Public Citizen, called the action against Lemon an “authoritarian breach” and an “egregious violation of the First Amendment.”

“Reporters in America are free to view, document, and share information with the public,” Gilbert said. “This arrest is a constitutional violation, an outrage, an authoritarian breach, and utterly appalling.”

Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated the date of the church protest.

Independent journalist Georgia Fort was taken into custody by federal agents Friday morning, an official who was briefed on the arrest told CNN’s Sara Sidner Friday morning.

Fort’s arrest comes the morning after former CNN anchor and independent journalist Don Lemon was taken into custody.

Both Fort and Lemon filmed dozens of anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protesters as they rushed into church in St. Paul, Minnesota, earlier this month, interrupting a service, leading to tense confrontations.

US Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed in a post this morning on X that Lemon and Fort, as well as two others, were arrested in connection with the church protest. Federal agents arrested the four at Bondi’s direction, the post reads.

Independent journalist who covered Minneapolis church protest says agents were at her door

“This is all stemming from the fact that I filmed a protest as a member of the media,” Fort said during a Facebook Live this morning before she surrendered to agents.

Details on what charges Fort and Lemon face weren’t immediately available.

“It’s hard to understand how we have a constitution, constitutional rights, when you can just be arrested for being a member of the press,” Fort said before ending this morning’s live video.

Journalist Don Lemon was taken into custody on Thursday night in connection to a protest at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, according to his attorney.

Lemon, a former CNN anchor, was with dozens of anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protesters as they rushed into Cities Church in St. Paul earlier this month, interrupting a church service and leading to tense confrontations.

Court records related to his arrest were not immediately available. Lemon is expected to appear in federal court in Los Angeles on Friday. Lemon was in Los Angeles to cover the Grammy Awards and was arrested after 11 p.m. local time in a hotel lobby in Beverley Hills as he was leaving for an event.

CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice for for information.

“Don Lemon was taken into custody by federal agents last night in Los Angeles, where he was covering the Grammy awards,” his attorney Abbe Lowell said in a statement early Friday. “Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done. The First Amendment exists to protect journalists whose role it is to shine light on the truth and hold those in power accountable.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last night that she was using “the best information we had at the time” when she made her initial statements about the killing of Alex Pretti, the second person killed by federal agents in Minneapolis this month.

Noem, who was among the top officials claiming in the immediate aftermath of the shooting that ICU nurse Alex Pretti was a “domestic terrorist” who posed a threat to law enforcement, on Thursday described the situation as “chaotic” and noted she was “being relayed information from on the ground from (Customs and Border Protection) agents and officers that were there.”

Noem’s comments come as she faces increased scrutiny of her job performance and her initial statements on the circumstances around Pretti’s killing.

CNN reported earlier Thursday that President Donald Trump and his top officials have publicly and privately maintained that the president still has full confidence in Noem, even as he has moved to sideline one of his top officials on the ground, Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino, putting border czar Tom Homan in charge of immigration operations in Minneapolis.

Senate leaders have a bipartisan funding deal in hand, but it remains to be seen whether they will avert a costly government shutdown as the clock ticks down toward Friday’s midnight deadline.

While negotiations appeared to stall late Thursday evening, the pace at which they had moved in recent days underscored the White House’s desire to avoid another prolonged federal funding fight. It also stood as a tacit acknowledgement of the political risks of ignoring the public outcry over ICE’s harsh tactics.

Lawmakers left Capitol Hill late Thursday after all rank-and-file senators could not come to agreement to swiftly move the spending package — the contours of which negotiators from both parties and the White House struck earlier in the day.Senators are set to return today with an eye toward sending the bills back to the House for final approval, but negotiations can change rapidly.

The deal, announced by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer hours before, includes a two-week stopgap funding extension for the Department of Homeland Security that Democrats had requested.

It also separates the DHS bill from a package of bipartisan spending bills to fund critical agencies through September, including the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor, Education, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development.

Even if the Senate is successful Friday, final passage could still be delayed until Monday — past the official shutdown deadline — as the House would have to return to Washington from its week-long recess. Speaker Mike Johnson, so far, has been non-committal on when exactly that might be, but swift approval by his chamber could blunt impacts of any lapse in funding to the federal workforce.

President Donald Trump said Alex Pretti, the man fatally shot by Customs and Border protection agents in Minneapolis Saturday, appeared “crazed and out of control” in video of a separate confrontation with federal agents 11 days before his death.

In the video that surfaced this week, Pretti is seen shouting at federal agents and kicking their vehicle’s taillight as the agents are driving away. The agents stop, exit their vehicle and tackle Pretti to the ground. The interaction in Minneapolis lasts a few seconds before Pretti gets up and the agents walk away. It is unclear what took place immediately before or after the footage.

Pretti suffered a broken rib during the encounter, sources told CNN.

Video of agents shooting Pretti and the Trump administration’s efforts to paint him as an “assassin” or “domestic terrorist” drew quick condemnation, including from some Republicans.

“A week before Alex was gunned down in the street – despite posing no threat to anyone – he was violently assaulted by a group of ICE agents,” Steve Schleicher, attorney for the Pretti family, told CNN when the video was released.

Dozens of asylum seekers and refugees who passed a rigorous, years-long vetting process before being admitted to the United States, have been arrested in Minnesota in recent weeks, immigration lawyers and advocates say.

The immigrants are shackled and placed on flights to detention facilities in Texas, where they are forced to recount painful asylum claims with limited or no contact with family members or attorneys, lawyers and advocates say.

Some, after days of interviews with officers, have been released in Texas without money, identification or phones. Others remain detained without information about why they’re being held.

Late Wednesday, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from arresting or detaining resettled refugees in Minnesota while a class-action lawsuit challenging the practice plays out. The judge also ordered the immediate release of all detained refugees in Minnesota, as well as the release of those taken out of the state within five days and gave the government 48 hours to provide a list of detained refugees.

CNN reached out to US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for comment.

Nationwide protests against President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown are expected today – with organizers calling for a boycott of school, work and shopping in areas across the country.

The demonstrations follow an “economic blackout” in Minneapolis last week, where hundreds of businesses were urged to shut for the day and thousands, gathering in stadiums or taking to the streets in sub-zero temperatures, called for ICE to get out of the city.

“The people of the Twin Cities have shown the way for the whole country – to stop ICE’s reign of terror, we need to SHUT IT DOWN,” organizers of today’s protests, endorsed by hundreds of organizations across the country, wrote on the shutdown’s website.

Elsewhere around the country, dozens of demonstrations and marches have been organized.

Protesters are expected to gather outside Minneapolis’ Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building starting at 8 a.m. local time, and a “national shutdown” march beginning at the city’s Government Plaza will begin at 2 p.m. Friday, according to organizers.

In New York City, protesters are expected to gather at 11 a.m. ET for an “ICE Out” demonstration at Foley Square, while in Atlanta, a “national shutdown” rally will take place at 5 p.m. ET on Buford Highway, a thoroughfare known for its vibrant mix of international cuisine and culture in the city.

Correction: A previous version of this post included the incorrect time zone for the protest planned at the Whipple building.

Kathleen Walters was only 23 days away from qualifying for early retirement at the IRS when she decided to quit, rather than acquiesce to a Trump-administration request that she break the law and compromise millions of people’s privacy. She’s one of hundreds of thousands of civil servants who have left or been fired from their federal-government jobs in the past year. In this episode, host Anne Applebaum speaks with Don Moynihan, an expert in the history of public policy from the University of Michigan. He explains how the destruction of America’s civil service is part of the administration’s greater effort to create a government that derives its power through unprecedented means and fundamentally disrupts democracy as we know it.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

[Music]

Anne Applebaum: From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I’m Anne Applebaum. In this new season, I’m asking how the Trump White House is rewriting the rules of U.S. politics, and talking to Americans whose lives have been changed as a result. Today’s episode examines the destruction of the civil service: the removal of professionals, and their replacement with loyalists. I’ve seen this kind of transformation before, in other failing democracies. Everyone suffers from the degradation of public services. Government institutions run by lackeys are also more easily manipulated by autocratic leaders, and no longer serve the public interest. Kathleen Walters found herself in the center of this story in 2025.

[Music]

Don Moynihan: I don’t think this is an anomaly, and I think what it tells us is about the way in which Trump is managing the civil service in his second term in a fashion that’s quite different from how he did in the first term.

Applebaum: Professor Don Moynihan is an expert in the history of public policy, and teaches at the University of Michigan.

Moynihan: And a lot of these disagreements really boil down to whether the president can order people to break the law. It’s a red flag when you see so many people saying, My god. This is so illegal that we cannot, in good conscience, stick around any longer.

Applebaum: Don, there are now many, many civil servants who have left or been fired, so tell us more about how this term may be different from President Trump’s first term.

Moynihan: I spent a few years at the end of Trump’s first term trying to think about how bad could it get in his second term. I did not anticipate just how bad it would become, partly because I didn’t anticipate that so many laws, civil-service laws and other laws, would be broken with seeming impunity. One of his big lessons from his first term was that there are a lot of lawyers in government who are telling me, No, I can’t do things. I need lawyers who will tell me, Yes you can. And so he’s systematically pushing the envelope on policy and, in many cases, breaking the law. And then also replacing those lawyers with more amenable actors. And so we see again and again, principled public officials saying, We think this crosses the boundaries, effectively being put on administrative leave, being told to resign, or, in some cases, being fired.

Applebaum: I want to ask you about the implications of all that, but first I think it would be helpful to give a little background here, because the United States hasn’t always had a professional, nonpartisan civil service. Until the Pendleton Act of the 1880s, we had something called the “spoils system,” which meant that only loyal party members could get jobs in government. And that system created corruption. It encouraged bribery. It was inefficient. How did that change?

Moynihan: The first major civil-service reform bill is introduced during the Civil War by Charles Sumner. And it’s a response to the perception that a lot of money is being wasted, the war effort is less efficient than it should be, partly because of the corruption that’s embedded in the use of public funds. We see stories of, basically, large contracts going to people aligned with the party. And so it became clearer to the public that you couldn’t really trust that the politicians were acting in the public interest when there was so much money sloshing around the public sector.

Applebaum: And so instead of that, we created a system that requires people to be hired and fired based on merit. And the Civil Service Reform Act, which comes later in the 20th century, also says you can’t hire or fire people because of their political affiliations. Correct?

Moynihan: That’s exactly right. The Civil Service Reform Act is the first act to actually write down what those merit principles are, and it specifies, very clearly, that employees cannot be treated differently because of their political affiliations.

Applebaum: And is the current administration adhering to this act?

Moynihan: Neither in spirit or in the letter of the law is the current administration adhering to this act, in my view. I think we’re at the most dramatic attack on the civil-service system since its creation in the 1880s. It feels that there is an element of the spoils system that is returning, but also, there is this much more direct attack on democracy that is part of the mechanization and the weaponization of the civil-service system right now.

Applebaum: And is this an effective strategy for improving government efficiency?

Moynihan: We know that research tells us that more politicization leads to generally worse outcomes. And this is for a variety of reasons. One is that you get less competent people who work for government under more politicized regimes. The more talented people tend to leave. You also have officials who don’t want to share bad news with their political principals. And so the presidents or the agency leaders are simply making worse decisions because they don’t have good access to information.

I’ll give you two examples of pieces of research here. One is that after the Pendleton Act, and the post office was no longer driven by patronage, you saw the accuracy and speed of mail delivery improve. So in a very specific way, you could see how performance got better. Another example is: The Bush administration used to rate agency programs on a one-to-five scale from “not performing” to “excellent.” And one analysis found that programs that were run by career civil servants tended to perform better than programs that were run by political appointees, all else being equal. Once you add politicization, things tend to get worse; once you give autonomy to capable professionals, things tend to get better when it comes to performance.

Applebaum: I mean, is there a precedent of other countries that had meritocratic civil service sliding backwards? The only example that comes into my head, since my background is in writing Soviet history, is the Bolsheviks, in the Soviet Union. The Soviet state created a civil service in which you could only advance if you were a party member, and not only that, you had to publicly state your allegiance to the party and its constantly changing principles, whenever you were asked to do it. Is there another country, another example, that you think of?

Moynihan: In Hungary, they put party cronies in charge of major parts of the system through a privatization scheme. In Turkey, we saw mass purges of people who were perceived as not being aligned with the administration. And so there is a common pattern there that I think serves as a warning sign.

Applebaum: And where do you see those warning signs now, in America?

Moynihan: So I think we’re seeing a multipronged attack on civil-service capabilities. Partly it’s through hiring. They want to put more loyalists into civil-servant positions. Partly it’s through firing. People who won’t go along with breaking the law are being shown the door. And partly it’s also through just instilling a culture of fear within our government.

Applebaum: Let’s break those down. What is unprecedented about the way the Trump administration is hiring civil servants?

Moynihan: The Trump administration announced a new hiring process, which it claimed would bring in better candidates for public-sector jobs. There were a couple of really unusual aspects to that. One is that people would submit essays where they would be asked to name their favorite Trump executive order and how they would help serve President Trump. And so that is new—the idea that job candidates will be asked, How are you gonna serve this particular president? Even though the job is, you’re supposed to serve every president, not just this individual president. The second part of the hiring process that’s changing now is that political appointees are directly involved in choosing these civil servants, and so it eliminates any barrier between the political appointees—those who are directly loyal to the president—and the people who are hired, which makes it much more likely that the people who are hired are also going to share those same political loyalties to President Trump.

Applebaum: Of course, political appointees have always had some involvement with the civil service, but there still seems to be something different now. There’s a culture of fear around these appointments that didn’t exist before, and we know that that culture of fear is being created deliberately. And we know that because the architect of a lot of these changes, Russell Vought, at the Office of Management and Budget, has said, “We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. We want to put them in trauma.” How are we seeing that play out?

Moynihan: I certainly think that was his goal. He has been upfront about viewing the government as an enemy, wanting a much smaller bureaucracy. And I think he has succeeded. One thing that’s important to understand is that this culture of fear that we’re seeing is not just driven by Trump officials. It’s also driven by Trump-aligned actors in broader society. And so, for example, Elon Musk might tweet about an individual government employee. They then get doxxed; they have to leave their home. You see private actors who are sort of conservative commentators identify individual civil servants. These could be FBI agents. And you read the next week: Those people have been fired.

And you also see a very organized effort, and some funded by organizations like the Heritage Foundation, to FOIA individual civil servants, to basically go through their emails, see if they can find any damaging language that would allow them to be fired, and to create, effectively, enemies lists, where individual civil servants are put on a website somewhere. There are lists of alleged crimes, which are often things like, Served on a DEI panel once, are listed. And then, again, you predictably see sometimes formal retaliation for that—a person might be put on leave or fired—but also informal attacks, where people get nasty phone calls, emails; sometimes people will turn up at their home and threaten them. And so the fear is not irrational. It is not just in the workplace; it’s in the broader society that these civil servants are now working in.

Applebaum: The third warning sign you listed is the mass firings. Since the Trump administration has taken office, hundreds of thousands of civil servants have been fired or have quit. Are these mass firings legal? I had always assumed, prior to this administration, that it wasn’t that easy to fire civil servants. In fact, this was one of the complaints that was sometimes made about them, is that they can’t be fired. How is it possible that this administration can just tell thousands of people to leave their jobs?

Moynihan: There are so many things I thought were illegal that now appear to be legal. It’s hard to keep a full list. If you asked me a year ago, Can the president eliminate an agency? or Can the president impound funds? I would’ve said, No, those are illegal things because that takes up congressional prerogatives too great an extent. They’re clearly unconstitutional. And now we have seen the president do both of those things. When it comes to firing individual employees, it is onerous to fire an individual employee. You can fire them for calls. That is to say: If they’re poor performers, you can fire them. They can appeal that decision. It can take a while to do that, but if you document the basis for the firing, it is possible to get rid of them. Ironically, it’s somewhat easier to fire lots of employees, because there is a legal “reduction in force” process—RIFs—where agencies can say: Because we need to save money, or because of some reorganization, we are going to eliminate a lot of positions.

Whether the Trump administration is using those reduction-in-force authorities legally, I think, is a very open question. RIFs are very technical documents and there’s a lot of procedures. It looks to me that the Trump administration has not followed in implementing those RIFs. Also, a huge number of people left through the deferred-resignation program, the so-called “fork in the road” voluntary-resignation program that Elon Musk introduced. It feels fairly clear to me that that was not following statutes, but a lot of people simply did leave, and it doesn’t seem like the Supreme Court is gonna do anything about it. The ways in which there was mass firings of probationary employees—a judge has ruled those to be illegal, but he’s also said: Well, it’s too late to fix it now. And so there is this sort of disturbing trend where things that really do appear to be illegal in terms of how federal employees are treated are allowed to move forward. And then maybe, down the line, the court will say, Well, that wasn’t right. But at that point, the remedy has pretty much walked out the door. Too much time has passed. So, for example, USAID doesn’t exist as an agency anymore. And so even if the courts were to say, That was illegal, there’s no workable solution for the employees who were laid off or for the programs that they were trying to implement.

Applebaum: Coming up after the break: The attack on the civil service may be part of a bigger project: Trump’s entourage wants to change our system so that they can stay in power.

[Break]

Applebaum: Don, talk about the practical impact of these firings. Of course they are felt by the people themselves, who’ve lost their jobs, but how will this affect the public at large?

Moynihan: I think there are two ways to answer that question. And so the first way is to think about the federal workforce as a group of employees who work for you. Do you want a group of employees that are knowledgeable, committed to their job, really dedicated to the goals that they’re trying to implement? And I think, historically, in America, we’ve mostly said yes. We get to hire some very smart people in government, partly because they care a lot about the mission, partly because they like the stability of government work. And so we probably get people who are coming not just for the paycheck—because they could earn more in the private sector—but because they’re really committed to the statutory goals of protecting the environment or emergency management. If you think of yourself as a mini-CEO overseeing this workforce, what we’re seeing is a bunch of structural changes that is gonna make it less easy for you to attract and retain good employees. They don’t appreciate the lack of stability. They don’t appreciate the toxic work environment, or being demonized. And so a lot of those people will exit, or they will never join the public sector in the first place. The stock of human capital in the workforce just gets worse.

Then we get to specific public services. And here, it’s harder to say, Planes are going to drop out of the sky tomorrow because there’s a 5 percent cut of FAA employees. And this is something about public services that is sometimes maybe a little different from private services, which is that the erosion of quality can be slower and harder to observe. I do think there are places we are starting to see this. Social Security has been struggling to serve its customers. I think the IRS—the fact that they’re hiring back people now is an admission that they simply don’t have enough people to manage the inflow of tax forms that will come at tax season. I think emergency management, to me, is a huge red flag, where FEMA did not have an especially bad summer in terms of natural disasters, but with flooding in Texas, it clearly was not as able to respond, partly because of the cuts and services, partly because of the extra layers of red tape that the DHS leadership imposed upon it. And so I think there will be more stories like that, where failures occur in a visible way. And then if you look at those failures honestly, you can say, Well, partly, this is because the Trump administration chose to reduce the capacity of these agencies.

Applebaum: So if things do begin to erode and government services begin to decline and more accidents happen with pollution or food safety, do you think people will make the connection between those accidents, and that erosion, and the attacks on the civil service?

Moynihan: What I do think is true is that there is a moment here of opportunity for civic education between the citizens of America and the government that serves them, where we can explain to them: Here it is; here’s what your government does. Here’s how your taxpayer dollars are spent. And when you sort of pull out these capacities, here’s how things start to collapse. We mostly don’t have those moments of opportunities, because they’re mostly moments of really bad outcomes. I think about Hurricane Katrina. That was an opportunity where we understood that putting unqualified people in charge of FEMA contributed to some very bad outcomes for the residents of New Orleans. So I think the work to be done there is to connect these failures that we see with choices made by the administration to undermine state capacity.

Applebaum: Earlier, you directly linked the civil-service firings with a decline in democracy, and you’ve also written elsewhere that President Trump is trying to build a more authoritarian political system. Let’s talk more specifically about what that means. For example, direct control of some state institutions could give a ruling party or leader advantages. So if the president can use the IRS to steal data or information, and use it in campaigns, or to initiate investigations against his enemies for political reasons, then the next time we go to vote, the playing field isn’t level. And that’s why neutral institutions that are meant to serve all of us shouldn’t be politicized.

Moynihan: Yeah. You need nonpartisan institutions to, I think, also create trust in government. And if we look at independent agencies, or, let’s say, take the Merit Systems Protection Board. This was created with the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act. These were the actors put in place, where if some employee is saying, I’ve been fired because of my political affiliation, or I’ve been fired because I wouldn’t do something illegal, they have the final sort of judgment on whether discrimination on political basis took place. But President Trump has basically taken control of that entity, removed any Democrats and put only Republicans on it. And so it’s no longer a credible check on government abuses at this point.

Applebaum: All of us have begun to focus on the midterms, and, clearly, the administration is nervous about them. How does the absence of thousands of federal civil servants, or the politicization of the civil service—how could it affect the elections? Do mass firings create an atmosphere of fear that impacts voting? What’s the connection between these two things?

Moynihan: One part of the authoritarian checklist that Trump has struggled most with is elections, and that’s partly because the constitutional system delegates the actual running of elections to state governments. And historically, the federal government has had minimal involvement over these processes. And, you know, right now that seems like a very good thing. But that doesn’t mean that a weaponized Department of Justice couldn’t sue or investigate or harass states or individual election officials for what they regard as improper behavior, which could be behavior that’s actually trying to maintain a free and fair election. It doesn’t mean that the president might not deploy the National Guard to election sites, or put ICE around election sites, on the claim that mass fraud is taking place. It is, I think, the area where Trump has made the least progress. But he’s clearly interested in this as a topic, and he’s issued executive orders claiming authority over elections that, constitutionally, he doesn’t seem to have—as he has done in other areas.

Applebaum: This seems, to me, to be the central point: the possibility of elections being shaped or manipulated by the executive. It’s not necessarily going to happen, but it’s also important that we take the possibility seriously. How do you think we should be thinking this? Should we be behaving differently; should we be acting differently?

Moynihan: We’re currently operating under an administration where you probably can’t retain a significant job if you don’t go along with the idea that somehow the 2020 elections were crooked. It does mean that the leadership of these agencies, like the Department of Justice, are going to be very much driven by people with this conspiratorial worldview, who are perhaps less dedicated to constitutional principles.

So I think in the blue states, you will have attorney generals who will be anticipating these efforts and will be, in some cases, responding to Department of Justice investigations. In red states, you’re gonna have this partisan alignment between the president and the actors in charge of individual states. And so I think, in both cases, public support for elections, public support for maintaining the integrity of elections, will become very important. Visible demonstrations by members of the public, if they can start to realize that there are real threats here, will become, I think, useful in reminding society as a whole that these elections do not run themselves.

        Katie Miller, the conservative podcaster, former DOGE aide, and wife to Stephen Miller, thinks the Constitution and the philosophical tradition upon which it is based are “woke” nonsense. Or possibly she doesn’t understand what they are. It’s hard to say which explanation is worse.

For several days, analysts have debated which of these discouraging explanations pertains. The relevant text is a pair of angry posts on X (most of her posts are angry) this week. The first came at 8:20 Monday morning. She highlighted, with evident alarm, a post from the day before by Caitlin Kalinowski, a hardware engineer best known for her work on virtual reality. Miller’s alarmed message read, “OPEN AI EXEC,” followed by three down arrows, a social-media way of saying, Look at the crazy thing this person just wrote!

Kalinowski’s nutty message consisted, in its entirety, of the following:

Quoting directly from the Constitution sans commentary used to be considered a rather cold take. Miller, however, treated it as an act of subversive radicalism.

Sixteen minutes later, Miller’s alarm seemed to have increased. She followed up the previous post by citing an even more offensive social-media message, from Chris Olah, another Silicon Valley executive. Olah set off Miller by including the following line, which she quoted incredulously: “My deep loyalty is to the principles of classical liberal democracy.” Miller commented, “If this is what they say publicly, this is how their AI model is programmed. Woke and deeply leftist ideology is what they want you to rely upon.”

Classical liberalism is not the same thing as woke, leftist ideology—it is essentially the antithesis. Liberalism, in the modern American context, refers to one strand of classical liberalism that favors activist government and social equality (the governing theory of the Democratic Party from the New Deal era onward). Classical liberalism is an Enlightenment philosophy, developed by thinkers such as John Locke and John Stuart Mill, built upon individual rights and limited government.

Classical liberalism is the philosophical inspiration for the American Revolution, the Constitution, and the broad civic norms that have shaped American life since the founding. Figures as diverse as Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan all saw themselves as heirs to classical liberalism.

Woke leftism is a pejorative description for a vein of radical skepticism of classical liberalism. These leftists accuse America’s system of government of being designed to preserve unequal power structures under the guise of philosophical neutrality.

There is also a rising strain of illiberalism on the right, sometimes called post-liberalism. The post-liberal right believes that the far left has captured American institutions, posing a mortal threat to the republic, which has forced the right to employ harsh exercises of state power to save the country from imminent ruin.

Stephen Miller is absolutely an adherent of the post-liberal right. The question is whether his wife was intending to endorse post-liberalism, or whether she mistook “classical liberal” to mean “liberals, but old”—like Walter Mondale or something.

Her posts offer support for both interpretations. The she-made-a-mistake hypothesis emphasizes her amateurish conflation. If Katie Miller wanted to accuse Olah of belonging to the woke left, she’d have claimed he was hiding behind classical liberalism, rather than citing his identification with the Enlightenment as a confession of left-wing radicalism. This reading would suggest Miller lacks any grasp of the theory that her husband, as a devoted national conservative, is dedicated to tearing down. Say what you want about the tenets of national conservatism, dude, at least it’s an ethos.

The intentionality hypothesis assumes she is consciously endorsing the theory embraced by her husband. “Yes, we’re very aware that you and your husband hate America’s system of liberal democracy that’s built on free elections, the rule of law, equal rights, and the freedom of speech, assembly, press, and religion,” Jon Favreau, of Pod Save America,replied to her post. Miller’s outraged posts about the Constitution support this interpretation. Since Miller has obviously heard of the Constitution, when she expresses alarm at amendments guaranteeing free speech, equal protection, and the like, she is knowingly taking direct aim at the pillars of liberal democracy.

There’s a third possibility, blending the first two. Miller grasps that social-media messages affirming the value of classical liberalism, and the value of the Constitution it inspired, are a rebuke of Trump.

Many Trumpists, including Trump himself, have a gut-level attachment to post-liberalism without any grounding in its doctrines. The philosophy isn’t terribly sophisticated anyway, and mostly amounts to the syllogism that the left is evil and powerful, so it must be defeated by any means necessary.

Miller demands fealty, or at least silence, as federal law-enforcement officers kill Americans who pose no apparent threat to them. Whether or not she understands post-liberalism at a theoretical level, by browbeating powerful business leaders who have a stake in government policy with the implicit threat of government retribution, she grasps how it works in practice.

        Updated at 4:55 p.m. ET on January 30, 2026

Some of the country’s most powerful men are panicking about testosterone levels. Tucker Carlson’s 2022 documentary The End of Men blamed declining testosterone for the supposedly rampant emasculation of American men. Influencers issue warnings that “low T is ruining young men.” Recently, the Department of Health and Human Services has gone all in on the hormone, publishing new dietary guidelines meant to help men maintain healthy testosterone levels and considering widening access to testosterone-replacement therapy. Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, told me in an email that “a generational decline in testosterone levels among American men is one of many examples of America’s worsening health.”

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has gone further, calling low T counts in teens an “existential issue.” The secretary, who at 72 has the physique of a Marvel character, has touted testosterone as part of his personal anti-aging protocol. He also recently proclaimed that President Trump has the “constitution of a deity” and raging levels of T.

American men are responding by attempting to increase their testosterone levels—whether they need to or not. Low-testosterone clinics, many of them based online, have proliferated, promising men a way to “get your spark back” or “reclaim your life.” So have supplements and accessories designed to support testosterone health—you can buy an ice pack designed specifically to keep testicles cool in a sauna. Recently, a friend who questioned his dedication to testicular health after seeing ads for testosterone boosters asked me if he should buy nontoxic briefs from a company called (yes, seriously) Nads.

Research has shown that average testosterone levels are indeed declining in American men. The primary study on the slump, published in 2007, followed Boston-based men over two decades and found that their levels had declined significantly more than would be expected from aging alone. Since then, numerous studies have documented the same trend among various age groups. The dip can probably be attributed to a number of factors, including rising obesity rates, widespread chronic disease, and sedentary lifestyles, Scott Selinger, a clinical associate professor at University of Texas at Austin’s Dell Medical School who studies testosterone, told me. Hot testicular temperatures—because of tight-fitting clothes, excessive sitting, or, more dramatically, a quickly warming climate—may also affect testosterone production, Selinger said.

Low testosterone really can be debilitating. Deficiency is linked to low libido, erectile issues, fatigue, heart disease, osteoporosis, anemia, and depression. But the prevalence of testosterone deficiency is hard to define. It ranges from 2 to 50 percent across studies and differs greatly by age. Speaking about men’s-health experts, Abraham Morgentaler, a urologist specializing in testosterone therapy at Harvard Medical School, told me, “I don’t think too many people are really concerned” about population-level declines. Major professional groups whose members study and treat testosterone deficiency—the Androgen Society, the Endocrine Society, the American Urological Association—haven’t launched any specific initiatives to combat low testosterone, Morgentaler said.

They are nonchalant in part because the average decline in testosterone is not especially large. The “normal” range for testosterone isn’t well defined; limits set by different medical societies span from about 300 to 1,000 nanograms per deciliter. The Boston paper found that the average participant’s testosterone levels dropped roughly 50 nanograms per deciliter every eight years or so, “which for some people can make a difference, but for a lot of people, it doesn’t,” Selinger said. Experts are more concerned about what might be driving the decline: “I wouldn’t say there is an epidemic of low testosterone,” Franck Mauvais-Jarvis, an endocrinology professor at Tulane University School of Medicine, told me. “The problem is the epidemic of chronic disease.”

Meanwhile, the number of American men receiving testosterone-replacement therapy has grown by almost 30 percent from 2018 to 2022. In TRT, lab-synthesized testosterone is administered to patients in a variety of formats, including injections, pills, topical gels, and slow-dissolving pellets inserted under the skin of their buttocks or hips. Testosterone, which is a controlled substance, is approved only for the treatment of testosterone deficiency; a diagnosis requires blood work that shows levels below the normal range over multiple days and, crucially, corresponding symptoms. But it’s also easy to get for other reasons. Doctors can prescribe it off-label to men with normal T levels who complain of low energy, decreased libido, or erectile dysfunction. Some gym fanatics buy it, sometimes through illicit channels, to build muscle, which is the only undeniable effect of raising T in someone with normal levels, Morgentaler said. All of the experts I spoke with were dubious that low-T clinics follow standard medical practice for prescribing testosterone, including discussing potential risks with patients and employing hormone specialists. (I reached out to two large testosterone clinics, but they did not respond.)

Whether the goal of these clinics is to treat low T or jack levels up to the max isn’t clear. Many encourage men to aim for excessive T, Michael Irwig, an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School, told me. A 2022 study of seven direct-to-consumer low-testosterone clinics found that three of them proposed a treatment goal of at least 1,000 nanograms per deciliter—one advertised a goal of 1,500. It should come as no surprise, then, that up to a third of men on TRT don’t have a deficiency, and that the majority of new testosterone users start treatment without completing the blood work needed for a diagnosis.

The maximalist approach to testosterone is risky. Although new research dismisses previous concerns about TRT causing cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer, too much of the hormone can elevate levels of hemoglobin, which raises the risk of blood clots, and estradiol, which can cause breast enlargement. It also causes testicular shrinkage and infertility. Although increasing testosterone can improve sexual performance, it has the opposite effect on reproduction, which is why the American Urological Association advises men to be cautious about TRT if they want to have kids. If a man begins testosterone therapy in his 20s and stays on it for upwards of five years, the chances that he’ll ever recover his original sperm levels are low, John Mulhall, a urologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, told me.

Plus, pumping the body full of testosterone may not alleviate the problems that patients set out to solve. Every patient responds to testosterone differently, Mauvais-Jarvis said; some men may feel perfectly fine at levels considered deficient, while others require far higher levels. The symptoms of deficiency could also be caused by any number of common ailments, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and depression. It’s not uncommon for a patient who still feels unwell after starting treatment to ask for more testosterone, Mulhall said. But if his problems have a different root cause, “pushing that man to a T level of 1,000 won’t improve his symptoms.”

The current spotlight on testosterone could lead to better care for men in at least one way: If the FDA removes restrictions on the hormone, more patients will be able to get treatment from their doctors—many of whom are reluctant to prescribe controlled substances—instead of turning to dubious third-party clinics, Mauvais-Jarvis said. This would be especially beneficial for the men who do have a genuine T deficiency but are currently not receiving treatment.

The panic over testosterone seems unlikely to end anytime soon, in part because it is about not just men’s health, but also manhood. The Trump administration is obsessive about manliness. Trump himself—who shared his T level (a perfectly respectable 441 nanograms per deciliter) during his first presidential campaign—has been lauded by his fans as a paragon of masculinity. The message is clear: When it comes to testosterone, more is definitely more.

The fight against ICE in Minneapolis defies easy categorization. Is it activism? Protest? Political opposition? Resistance? None of these terms quite captures what we’re seeing: people putting their own bodies on the line to care for immigrants and impede the operations of a paramilitary force in their city. My colleagues have come up with their own, apt ways to describe it: Maybe this is “neighborism,” or a movement for “basic decency.” I like the way an elderly couple named Dan and Jane, in one dispatch, explained their motive for joining the effort: “humanist.”

The word that comes to my mind is dissidence. If we want to understand why the whistleblowing, camera-wielding people of Minneapolis have caused the Trump administration—and Donald Trump himself—to flinch, I believe we need some added history, and a bigger map. What we’ve been watching is part of a long, established tradition—one that might help Americans unlock a different kind of future.

Dissidence is not revolution; it is not even political opposition. It’s something much more elemental. It emerges in environments where power—usually government power—tramples on the basic conditions of life as people know and value them. We recognize what this means in Minneapolis: People do not like to see their neighbors terrified and rounded up. They do not like to see masked men with guns acting with impunity. They do not like their children being too afraid to go to school. Unlike, say, the “pussy hat” protests that immediately followed Trump’s first inauguration and launched what came to be known as the resistance, the reaction of regular people in Minneapolis is not, fundamentally, about an ideological or policy disagreement with the administration. The movement that has arisen on the city’s frigid streets is about defending what any reasonable American would call “normal”—the expectation of a life without the threat of violence and coercion.

This is when the dissident has always stepped in. Since Trump’s first term, historians have been furnishing us with analogies from the past to help explain our unprecedented political reality—many more people now feel comfortable uttering words such as authoritarianism, even fascism. But when it comes to the mindset and actions necessary to stand up to these forces, the past also provides precedents—and role models—that we shouldn’t ignore. For as long as tyranny has existed, there have been people who resist the pressures of conformity or even the natural instinct toward self-preservation in order to say “no.”

The dissidence of Minneapolis reminds me of the Argentinian mothers who found themselves in an impossible situation during the military junta of the late 1970s. Their children, deemed “subversives” for their work with the poor or their leftist politics, were abducted in the middle of the night, disappeared without explanation. The most obvious choice for each of these mothers was to keep quiet, to avoid drawing attention to her family. But some refused to do so. They started searching and asking questions, and eventually they joined together to stand week after week, year after year, outside the presidential palace with signs that read Where are they?

Today’s dissidence also reminds me of the Underground Railroad. Think of what this network of liberation demanded: all of those innkeepers, church deacons, farmers, and housewives risking violence and potential arrest in a country that was, as Frederick Douglass put it, “given up to be a hunting-ground for slaveholders.” In an environment of terror—the Fugitive Slave Acts made harboring a runaway a federal crime—these individuals conducted their own moral calculus: Slavery was an abnormality, one worth obstructing in any way, at any cost.

This is not a history of people practicing politics or fighting for regime change. It is, in fact, humanist. These people are not looking to replace one governing order or ideology with another. They are fighting an incursion, reacting to a violation of humanity, and deciding to do something about it.

Another dissident comes to mind, a familiar if anonymous one. Most people assume that the man in that famous photo from 1989 who stood in front of a line of tanks near Tiananmen Square was trying to block them from crushing the democracy protests. And that may have been his intent. (No one ever learned his identity or his fate.) But I see something else in that lone figure carrying two shopping bags: a man who is perhaps heading home to prepare dinner, who has a recipe in mind, who has been planning what music to listen to on his cassette player that night and remembering the details of a conversation with his wife, when four tanks suddenly appear in his path. They are blocking his path, not the other way around. The dissident insists on continuing his journey home. He refuses to move out of the way.

The dissident who probably thought most about what it means to be a dissident was Václav Havel, the Czech playwright who, in 1989, became the first democratically elected president of his country. Havel understood dissidence, at its inception, as not being political at all; he considered it, rather, “pre-political.” It could emerge from wanting to play strange music, wear one’s hair long, speak one’s mind, defend one’s economic interests, or protect vulnerable neighbors. When you are not allowed to assert these core aspects of who you are—to be a fully autonomous human—you face a choice: Either abandon those parts of yourself, or refuse to and become a dissident.

One of Havel’s greatest achievements was Charter 77, a petition—and then a movement—that became a sustained opposition to the Communist regime. But he was always quick to point out that what launched the whole effort was the arrest of a band of anemic-looking, long-haired rock musicians called the Plastic People of the Universe. Their only crime, it seems, was wanting to play weird, psychedelic music redolent of Frank Zappa. There was nothing subversive about their songs—many of which were about loving beer—and so it was not hard to appreciate what was being suppressed when the musicians were put on trial and sentenced to prison, nor were the stakes for every free person difficult to understand.

This elemental appeal of dissidence is easier to see when we compare it with the resistance that has marked most of the Trump years. The tactics of activists have largely included mass protests, most recently those of No Kings Day, as well as smaller, simpler ones, say, chanting and ringing bells in front of Tesla showrooms. Such acts are useful for bolstering your own political side, for creating a sense of solidarity. But they don’t usually help widen the circle of opposition. They are more like pep rallies—not without value, but also easy to ignore. The same can be said of the resistance’s main message, which tends to focus on Trump’s threats to democracy and the rule of law. This, too, is not pre-political, because it tends to alienate those who don’t already agree with this dire (if accurate) analysis.

Compare the grievances of these protests with the issues and stakes that dissidents have revealed in Minneapolis. The assault by federal agents was an attack on something pre-political, on parts of our communal existence that people, in normal times, take for granted. You should be able to assume that parents, immigrant or not, won’t be ripped away from children. You should assume that people don’t have to hide in their house because their skin is brown or black. You should assume that filming an interaction with the police won’t end in your death. These are all pre-political assumptions, and we hold them not as Democrats or Republicans, but as individuals who just want to live freely.

Havel, surprisingly, didn’t much like the word dissident and used it, he said, “with distaste, rather ironically, and almost always in quotation marks.” He worried that the label gave the impression that there was some rarefied class of people whose job it was to be “professional malcontents”; dissidents, he insisted, were just “ordinary people with ordinary cares.” What made them special was their defense of those pre-political instincts that we all share. Does the fact that they are defending something so basic diminish what dissidents do? I don’t think so. How many people really are willing to sacrifice so much for the sake of just being human?

When it comes to Trump, we’ve just seen dissidence gain a tactical victory where resistance has failed. The question for those appalled by the actions of this administration has always been how to get more people to share a morally grounded outlook on what is happening to the country. This is hard, to put it mildly. Almost every news event gets filtered through a tribal lens (and the tribalized media that supports it). Even the death of Renee Good, caught on video from multiple angles, was largely interpreted in partisan ways.

But since the killing of Alex Pretti, something has shifted. A wider swath of people are beginning to perceive the state’s violence against its citizens as an abnormality. Just listen to the Republican who dropped out of the race for Minnesota governor in part because of what he was seeing in Minneapolis: “I cannot support the national Republicans’ stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so.” The change could be felt even in Trump himself, who demoted the man running the Border Patrol operation in the city and spoke of the need to “de-escalate a little bit”—not a phrase that’s commonly in his vocabulary. We are a long way from justice for these two deaths, but to judge by polls and even Fox News coverage, many more people now agree that a violation has taken place.

This happened because of the American dissidents in Minneapolis. They have organized outside of the spotlight, and not toward a nationwide mobilization but with a sharp, local focus on their neighbors. They communicate on Signal channels, stand guard outside elementary schools, bring food to scared immigrants sheltering in their homes. They have placed an emphasis on watchfulness, on care, on safety and calculated risk—all qualities that characterized dissidents in the Soviet Union and characterize them today in Tehran and Beijing. Their actions resulted in images that bore moral witness to what federal agents are doing in their city. But they also established a sharp contrast that people with open eyes and goodwill could not fail to recognize.

The American dissidence, should it continue and grow, will need to look different from the resistance of months and years past. It will need to focus on what is common to all of us, what Havel called “the aims of life.” We share many more of these aims than we sometimes realize. We may disagree about tax rates and foreign policy, gun rights and rent freezes, but “normal” is a universal concept in America when it comes to what we expect for our children, our communities, and our sense of security and well-being. To be a dissident in this moment means moving beyond scoring points and underscoring differences, and on to recognizing what we are all losing—and blowing a whistle in order to prevent that loss.

Dissidence might seem to be a lonely act. It has always started that way. But what is called for now is the spirit of that man in Tiananmen Square, that immovable character, a human who insists on getting home to do the things that give his life purpose and will not let a few tanks get in his way.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> The Trump administration is escalating military tensions with Iran, deploying naval assets and demanding a new nuclear deal following a series of military actions in nations like Venezuela and Yemen. While the president uses high-pressure tactics similar to those used in the fictionalized capture of Nicolás Maduro, experts warn that Iran's advanced military capabilities and lack of a clear successor to Ayatollah Khamenei make a potential conflict far more complex and risky than previous operations.

        <hr/>
        The Trump administration is contemplating another attack on a foreign adversary, using a familiar script. Once again, the president has assembled what he described as an “armada” of ships within striking distance of his potential target and has told a nation’s leaders to make a deal—or else. The administration has provided hints at its rationale for military action and indications of what it wants from a deal, which the leaders of the nation in Donald Trump’s sights have summarily rejected. And the president has again said that time is quickly running out.

Such presidential bluster might be dismissed as another example of Trump’s Art of the Deal diplomacy—making exaggerated threats in the hope of forcing a negotiated settlement. But given that less than a month ago, Trump delivered on similar threats by carrying out a stunning, high-risk assault that dragged Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from his palace to a New York prison, another military assault, this time on Iran, is very possible.

At least 11 U.S. naval ships were positioned around Venezuela when the United States struck. Now at least 10 are near Iran, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, which left the Asia-Pacific region two weeks ago and just arrived in the Middle East. Over the past 10 days, the U.S. has also moved aircraft, drones, and air-defense systems to the region, just as it did in the run-up to the attack on Venezuela. And like Maduro, Iran’s leaders are signaling that they won’t agree to terms that the president says will avert a strike, namely swearing off any future work on nuclear weapons. Trump officials have suggested they are considering several targets in Iran but have yet to define what victory would look like or what they plan to do if strikes were to cause the regime in Tehran to fall.

The Navy is “ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary,” Trump said on Truth Social on Wednesday. “Hopefully Iran will quickly ‘Come to the Table’ and negotiate a fair and equitable deal—NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS—one that is good for all parties. Time is running out, it is truly of the essence!” He added: “The next attack will be far worse!”

The threat of military strikes on troublesome regimes has become a hallmark of Trump’s second term. The United States conducted a weekslong campaign targeting Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen last year, followed by targeted strikes on Iran’s nuclear program in June and this month’s raid targeting Maduro. If the U.S. attacks Iran, it would become the fifth country targeted since Christmas, joining Nigeria, Syria, Somalia, and Venezuela.

But another round of strikes on Iran—if Trump ultimately decides to act—would be different and might not deliver the kind of quick military success that the president favors. Tehran has the most advanced military capabilities among the countries that the U.S. has targeted, both in terms of its national military and via its proxies, which pose a threat to American allies in the region. Even if the U.S. wanted to replace the top leader in Iran, as it did in Venezuela, there is no clear successor. Iran is run by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who serves as the supreme religious and military leader.

The fall of the ayatollah could empower the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, a powerful branch of Iran’s security apparatus that operates independently of the nation’s armed forces. Although Trump’s recent threats have centered around nuclear talks, previous statements—as well as military planning—have suggested punishing the regime for its brutal repression of nationwide protests.

U.S. officials told us that targeting those responsible for the repression is under consideration. This could include the National Information Network—the country’s internet-and-tech agency, which imposed a dayslong internet blackout as security forces carried out massacres against protesters. (Elon Musk has offered his Starlink satellite service to Iranian protesters, but access has been limited.) Planners also have looked at targeting whatever remains of the country’s air-defense system, and its ballistic-missile program. Advisers have leaned heavily toward the use of cyberattacks to limit any risk posed to U.S. personnel or military assets. “Chaos and entropy are the only possible path,” one official told us.

What began as an outcry by the Iranian public over the country’s deepening economic crisis, including record-high inflation and the collapse of its currency, the rial, has culminated in the most widespread and deadly uprising since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The regime’s bloodthirsty tactics have testified to its growing desperation, and human-rights activist groups say that anywhere from 6,000 to 16,000 people have been killed.

Trump has repeatedly signaled his willingness to intervene in support of the protesters, telling them via social media nearly three weeks ago that “HELP IS ON ITS WAY.” But there was little he could do at the time: The U.S. military was stretched thin, with its most crucial defensive assets stationed in the Caribbean and Pacific. Since then, the protests have quieted because of the government’s repression, calling into question whether strikes now would reignite the protests and potentially force out the regime—or just intensify violence in Iran and deepen instability across the Middle East.

Trump has demanded a resolution to the two countries’ long-standing disagreements about Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The president said this week that Iran is interested in talks. But Iranian officials have publicly rejected making concessions, instead threatening a swift response to any U.S. attack.

“Our brave Armed Forces are prepared—with their fingers on the trigger—to immediately and powerfully respond to ANY aggression against our beloved land, air, and sea,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote on social media Wednesday evening.

Diplomatic solutions remain possible. Araghchi arrived today in Turkey, which has acted in the past as an intermediary, to meet with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan.

The Iranian foreign minister’s bellicose words should not be considered mere rhetoric, Vali Nasr, a professor of international affairs and Middle East studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told us.

Rather, Iran could be sending the message that it may conduct strikes far bigger than those it launched on an American base in Iraq following the 2020 U.S. assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’s elite Quds Force. It may even go bigger than its retaliatory strikes on Israel after the June attack on its nuclear program.

“In the past, Iran has reacted to U.S. strikes symbolically. There is a chance that Iran will respond this time in a way that they haven’t before,” Nasr said. “They may decide to target U.S. troops or targets in the Gulf or global oil supply—something major. And if that happens, the U.S. could potentially be drawn into a much longer conflict with Iran.” That may be especially true if, weakened by the recent protests, Tehran sees strikes as an existential threat that demands a “Damn the torpedoes” response.

American partners in the Gulf that host U.S. military bases forbid the launching of strikes from inside their borders, so fighter jets or bombers would likely take off from faraway bases or naval ships. Several Gulf allies have warned that U.S. strikes could lead to regional instability and shocks to the global oil economy: The Houthis in Yemen said they would attack ships transiting the Red Sea. IRGC-backed groups in Iraq warned about war. And an online video purported to show members of Hezbollah vowing to fight should Iran come under attack.

“Neighboring countries are our friends, but if their soil, sky, or waters are used against Iran, they will be considered hostile,” Mohammad Akbarzadeh, political deputy of the IRGC naval forces, said, according to the Fars News Agency.

The question of what comes next hangs over any military operation. The Trump administration surprised Venezuela’s democratic opposition by working with Maduro’s lieutenants after the dictator’s capture, with the intention of facilitating a later political transition. Working with the remnants of the Iranian regime would be much more complex, given the Tehran government’s longevity, ideological hostility toward Washington, and hierarchies.

But Iran’s opposition movement is fragmented and, as one Trump-administration official told us, “can’t be in the same room, let alone agree who among them should lead.” The only thing it can agree on is that the clerics need to cede power to the people. Beyond this, its divisions along ideological lines—its movement including monarchists, secularists, ethnic autonomy movements, and militant organizations—are significant. The various factions come to the table with deep historical grievances and conflicting visions for a post-regime Iran.

Political pressure is also coming from Capitol Hill, where Republican legislators told Secretary of State Marco Rubio Wednesday that they are frustrated by the White House conducting major military operations without congressional consent—or even advance notification. During a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, described the January 3 assault on Venezuela as an act of war enabled by an “expansive notion of presidential power.” Although the administration argued that Maduro’s capture was a law-enforcement operation, making a similar case for striking a nuclear-powered adversary such as Iran would be hard.

Rubio told the committee that Iran “is probably weaker than it has ever been,” in large part because it is spending too much on weapons and proxies instead of fixing long-term economic problems. Iran’s currency this week dropped to ⁠a record ‍low of 1,500,000 rials to ‍the ⁠dollar. Yesterday, the European Union labeled the IRGC a terrorist organization in response to its crackdown on protesters.

But Rubio also appeared to signal an off-ramp from the prospect of military action, describing the U.S. buildup of ships, aircraft, and air defenses as a “preemptive defensive option” that was prudent to “prevent the attack against thousands of American servicemen and other facilities in the region and our allies.”

More telling, Rubio acknowledged that the U.S. has no clear succession plan for Iran should strikes tip an already weakened regime out of power. An arrangement like the one the U.S. has with Caracas, he suggested, would be much trickier to pull off.

Rubio told Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican: “That’s an open question.”

        <hr/>
        On October 1, fireworks soared from El Helicoide, a sprawling prison complex that spirals around a hill in the center of Caracas. To many of those who knew what went on inside the structure, the spectacle was sickening.

At El Helicoide, guards reportedly hang political prisoners by their limbs and force them to plunge their face into bags of feces. Venezuela has quite a few places like it: Locking up critics was a key feature of President Nicolás Maduro’s governing style. His regime jailed thousands of them—opposition leaders, journalists, activists, foreign nationals, as well as everyday Venezuelans—typically on charges such as “betrayal of the homeland” and “rebellion,” and usually without granting them a trial.

El Helicoide stands out from the other prisons in part because of its history: In the 1950s, architects conceived it as a futuristic mall, but the building went unused until Maduro repurposed it as a series of torture chambers. Some Venezuelans have come to see El Helicoide as the defining monument of Maduro’s rule. With his pyrotechnic display, which came as the Trump administration was intensifying its rhetoric against Maduro and striking boats off of Venezuela’s coast, Maduro seemed to be sending a brazen message: His regime was holding together, and its repression would not relent.

Now Maduro sits in an American prison, and Venezuela is governed by his erstwhile second-in-command, Delcy Rodríguez, under a heavy American hand. What she will do with the repressive apparatus that El Helicoide represents is the question that preoccupies many Venezuelans who hope to leave the Maduro era behind.

According to human-rights organizations, Venezuela held at least 1,000 political prisoners at the time of Maduro’s capture. His reign had become so associated with these detentions that many family members of prisoners told me that as soon as they found out Maduro had fallen, they rushed to the prisons to inquire what would happen to their loved ones. Opposition activists made the detainees’ plight a core issue.

“I think all sectors of Venezuelan civil society have taken up the liberations as our central banner,” Adriana Pichardo, a former lawmaker now in exile, told me shortly after Maduro’s capture. “It’s the most important thing we need in order for Venezuela to have a real transformation.” Local journalists began covering the issue assiduously, scrutinizing public statements for clues as to what would happen to those who were detained.

For much of the Venezuelan opposition, the fate of the political prisoners promises to show both what the Trump administration intends for Venezuela and whether the country has left Maduro behind. Earlier this month, American officials began calling for them to be freed, and Rodríguez seemed to respond, if slowly. According to the human-rights group Foro Penal, the regime released 104 people on Sunday. (President Trump thanked Rodríguez for the “powerful humanitarian gesture.”) The total number of people who have been released this month is now 302. This leaves about 70 percent of known political prisoners locked up, suggesting that either American officials don’t have as much control over the regime as they claim—or that they do and haven’t cared enough to use it.

The Maduro regime used arbitrary detention as one of its primary tools of intimidation. Foro Penal has documented more than 18,000 cases in the past decade of people arrested without legal justification or due process. These include children, people with disabilities, and the elderly, as well as political targets such as opposition leaders and activists. In 2024, police intercepted a private voice message in which a doctor named Marggie Orozco, in referring to the country’s economic crisis, said that the government was “starving us to death.” For her complaint, Orozco received a 30-year prison sentence.

During its first days in power, Rodríguez’s government imprisoned dozens of Venezuelans, including two farmers who had celebrated Maduro’s fall and 14 journalists who had covered the new president’s swearing-in ceremony. Then, three days after Maduro’s capture on January 3, Trump made a passing comment that seemed to cause the regime to change tack.

“They have a torture chamber in the middle of Caracas that they’re closing up,” Trump said during a speech to congressional Republicans, without elaborating. Within hours, Spanish-language news outlets were reporting that Trump had announced the closure of El Helicoide, citing no further evidence than Trump’s verbal aside.

El Helicoide did not close. But Jorge Rodríguez, the president of Venezuela’s parliament and Delcy’s brother, announced on January 8 that the government would release a “significant number” of prisoners. Trump seemed pleased: “Because of this cooperation,” he wrote on Truth Social, “I have cancelled the previously expected second Wave of Attacks, which looks like it will not be needed.”

Over the next two weeks, the government released prisoners at a pace that activists described to me as “drop by drop”—about 10 a day, on average. Rumors spread that many of the remaining detainees were dead. (One of them, Edilson Torres, died at age 52 just days after the releases began.) Some in Venezuela speculated that the government had tortured the prisoners so gruesomely that it was afraid to let the public see or hear from them. Back in 2023, Amnesty International reported that officials had beaten a prisoner until she had to use a wheelchair and forced her to have an abortion.

Zair Mundaray, who worked as a public prosecutor for about 20 years before fleeing the Maduro regime, offered two theories about why the release of Venezuela’s political prisoners has been so sporadic. The first relates to Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, who controlled much of Venezuela’s judiciary before U.S. troops captured her along with her husband. According to Mundaray, his former colleagues who still work for the Venezuelan government say that Flores left behind a power vacuum that no one has been able to fill. As a result, he told me, judicial decision making has slowed. The second theory is that Rodríguez is not herself in any hurry to release these prisoners, which the Trump administration doesn’t seem to mind.

Last week, Rodríguez claimed that the government had released 626 prisoners, but she provided no evidence. She also did not specify whether these were common prisoners or political ones—a distinction that the government doesn’t acknowledge and that has become hard for NGOs to draw. In 2024, the government officially banned groups that track political prisoners, such as Foro Penal. Many of them continue to operate, but their jobs have grown more difficult. Many political prisoners go unclassified because families fear that registering them with an illicit organization would lower their chance of getting out. Since the releases began, though, many people have registered their loved ones. Foro Penal has verified some 200 previously unreported instances of political imprisonment since January 8.

Even when a political prisoner is released, their liberty remains conditional. Edward Ocariz, an activist and former prisoner, told me that many former detainees have to go to court for monthly check-ins. In many cases, authorities use these occasions to rearrest them, Ocariz said. The government also forbids former prisoners from leaving the country or giving interviews to the press, a condition of release that he decided to break at his own risk. He asked me to use the word unjailed to refer to released inmates, not freed.

Last Friday, Venezuela observed a national holiday commemorating the fall of a military dictatorship that ruled the country until 1958. Rodríguez called for a demonstration in Caracas to protest the capture of Maduro—the man who, she suggested, best embodies the spirit of that day.

Not far from the demonstration, in a town near Caracas, people were lining up outside El Rodeo 1 prison hoping to see their loved ones. Each Friday, a queue starts forming at dawn, Lorealbert Gutierrez, a 19-year-old with five relatives in prison, told me. Many visitors bring gifts; Gutierrez usually comes bearing soap. Some visitors aren’t able to get in, and those who do typically wait for hours. Guards blindfold them and escort them to a room where they have 25 minutes to speak with their loved one from behind a screen, under constant supervision.

Massiel Cordones, the mother of a prisoner, wasn’t scheduled to visit her son until Sunday, but she had been camping outside El Rodeo for weeks. As soon as she heard that the government would release some prisoners, Cordones drove seven hours to Caracas. She couldn’t afford a hotel in the capital, so she slept under the roof of a pavilion next to the prison, where vendors sell food to family members of prisoners on visiting days. The first night, she slept on the floor. Then volunteers gave her a mattress.

Cordones’s son is José Ángel Barreno, a 28-year-old army lieutenant. She told me that Barreno never disobeyed his superiors or criticized the government, but he is the nephew of a soldier who defected, so his colleagues distrusted him. In 2020, the regime arrested Barreno while the military searched for his uncle. Authorities first sent him to El Helicoide, where guards administered electric shocks as a form of torture. Yet he told his mother that El Rodeo, where he’s been since 2022, was worse. “He said this was the true hell,” Cordones told me. Cordones sold her house to pay for lawyers and reported her son’s case to Foro Penal.

“You know, when your son is a political prisoner, you are a political prisoner,” she said. “It’s the end of happiness. How can you eat knowing he’s not eating? How can you sleep knowing that he’s cold?”

I first spoke with Cordones on Saturday. She told me she was almost sure that officials wouldn’t let her visit. Earlier last week, she had made a public statement calling out the torture inflicted on prisoners. Cordones feared that authorities would punish her or her son for her outspokenness. But her son had told her many times to carry on talking to the press about conditions inside the prison. She had heard that guards were telling the prisoners that their families had stopped camping outside and were no longer holding candlelit vigils every night. Cordones wanted her son to know that this was not true.

I spoke with her again the following afternoon and found her overjoyed. She had woken up to the news that more than 100 political prisoners had been released in just a single day. And she had gotten to see her son and relay the news. Cordones told me she now felt certain that he’d be released one day. And at the very least, she had gotten to tell him that families were still camping outside and holding vigils—that the political prisoners had not been forgotten.

        For Lowell

There are things which, said and true,

are of this generation’s past;

of fighting freedom’s battles

and of taking off the mask—

stories of the actions taken,

to blot out the blights of sin,

how heroes and the valorous

fought their enemies within,

of turning boldly with the light

to evil’s war against the truth.

And now that struggle is renewed:

given birth and a new youth.

We must fight this same malady

with courage and resolve,

for our nation is the sum

of the action of us all.

Would we be traitors to our

bugle, which beckons with its call?

—

Children used as bait to bargain

with their parents in deceit;

bodies lying lifeless, static,

shot dead, cold, in the street.

This has been the nation’s song.

Read of Adams’s decree:

There’s “Dignity” and “Majesty”

in tea thrown in the sea.

“Something notable And striking,”

he wrote in his diary.

One could not help but to see

an “Epocha in History.”

They quartered troops among them,

amid times of bitter peace,

when that massacre in Boston,

for a nation, stained a lease.

They won freedom for their people

but in fine print said: be damned.

To that man who said, of ham, they’d

“rob old Tony, Doll, and Sam”

the hypocrisy was notable,

and took some years to fight—

those critics of the sheep-stealer,

who in man-stealers delight—

Until those people stole away,

and set fire to freedom’s light.

—

Those things ripple and echo,

blaring loudly on repeat

that which would better a re-

public: from sea to shining sea.

Our nation needed purpose

and it lacked, almighty, God.

He who told of tribulations

warned us of the chastening rod.

As the great believer cautioned,

treachery says up when down;

it “scatters whole families”

without second thought or sound.

        <hr/>
        A writer is a kind of magician. Their job is to create living, three-dimensional people out of the ordinary stuff of ink and paper. This is no easy task, because readers can’t literally hear, touch, or observe a character. Everything that defines a human being in real life—the physical space they occupy, or how they smell, feel, and sound—is stripped away, replaced by description. But authors have one major, mystical advantage: They can show you what’s happening inside of someone’s brain.

First, here are four stories from The Atlantic’s Books section:

The novelist George Saunders makes great use of this asset in his new novel, Vigil. Its narrator, Jill, is a literal mind reader who pops into the heads of people on the edge of death. In Vigil, she watches over the expiring K. J. Boone, an oil magnate who spent his life degrading the Earth and denying the effects of climate change. Readers get to see Boone’s past and present, his brittle family relationships, and all of his self-serving internal narratives. In theory, we have access to everything that makes up this man—every unique facet of his psyche, every cruel word and deed, and, yes, every mitigating circumstance. Yet Saunders “seems unwilling to convey Boone’s more sympathetic attributes without some swift reminder that he’s a bastard,” Julius Taranto writes, with some disappointment, in his essay about the novel for The Atlantic. In the end, he argues, Boone is still rendered in 2-D.

Nonfiction writers also face the challenge of making a person rise out of a paragraph. This is especially interesting in the case of memoirists, who are trying to introduce readers to themselves—sometimes in service of, say, laying the groundwork for a political campaign. In his new book, Where We Keep the Light, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro “is doing what presumptive candidates for the highest office usually do when they write such a book,” my colleague Gal Beckerman writes. “He is laminating his narrative.” Shapiro is presenting a very particular version of himself: average Joe, leader, and, especially, religious man. The Jewish governor intentionally uses the universal word faith, Beckerman writes, as “a bridge between who he is and the people he is trying to reach.”

But is this Shapiro in full? Can his memoir authentically introduce him to America? Probably not: His book is more of a promotional vehicle than a look at the man’s honest soul. But Beckerman and Taranto’s critiques are interesting because of what they imply about more successful books. If Saunders and Shapiro both come short of creating a three-dimensional person, this reminds us that in the best works, the subtle alchemy of summoning succeeds. A writer really can bring a person to life.

George Saunders Brings Morality Back to Fiction

By Julius Taranto

The author’s work makes an excellent case that literature can explore virtue—even if his latest novel reveals its pitfalls.

What to Read

Rangikura, by Tayi Tibble

On a snowy day, you could curl up by the fire with something wholesome and cozy; you could perch by the window with something chilly and somber. Or you could crack open the New Zealand poet Tayi Tibble’s Rangikura, which is none of these things. Playful, forceful, and sexy, it radiates so much heat that choosing it for a holiday read is like fleeing south for the winter. (And in Tibble’s home country, December is summer.) That’s not to say it’s unserious: Tibble reflects on the relentless shame she used to feel about her gender and her Indigenous Māori heritage; she charts how she emerged from timidity like flowers peeking out from a melting blanket of ice. Rangikura is the result of her transformation, and it is a persuasive case for freedom, pleasure, and fun that honors the generations of women in her family who also celebrated, shouted, and danced. “I’m hotter than the sun,” she declares. “And my ancestors ride wit me / like dawgs. When I whistle / they run and run and run.” — Faith Hill

The Accidental Winners of the War on Higher Ed

By Ian Bogost

I texted, emailed, telephoned, and Zoomed with friends in higher-education leadership. Current and former heads of both research universities and liberal-arts colleges confirmed my intuition: Well-resourced and prestigious small colleges are less exposed in almost every way to the crises that higher ed faces.

To dig deeper, I decided to embark on a fact-finding mission in the guise of a traditional college tour. In November, I went to visit four elite liberal-arts colleges—Amherst, Davidson, Smith, and Vassar—where I joined prospective students and their parents for their campus tours, sat in on classes, and spoke with undergraduates, professors, and administrators. Might schools such as these emerge as the accidental winners of the war on universities?

On this week’s Galaxy Brain, Charlie Warzel opens with what it means to live in 2026, when our phones can drop us into graphic, real-time violence without warning—and when documenting that violence can be both traumatizing and politically consequential. Using recent footage out of Minneapolis as a lens, he explores the uneasy collision of algorithmic feeds, misinformation, and the moral weight of witnessing. Charlie also traces how viral documentation can puncture official narratives, pushing stories beyond political circles and even into “apolitical” corners of the internet. Then, Charlie is joined by Amanda Litman, a political digital strategist and the co-founder of Run for Something. They discuss how to be a good citizen in the information war without losing your mind. Specifically: In an age of algorithmic fragmentation and billionaire-owned platforms, does sharing that devastating image or news article actually accomplish anything? Or is it just performative activism? Together they explore how nonpolitical creators and everyday people can be especially persuasive messengers, and how to pair online engagement with offline activism. It’s an episode about how to stay engaged without surrendering your nervous system and how to use the internet as a tool for connection, clarity, and action, not just despair.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

[Music]

Charlie Warzel: I’m Charlie Warzel, and this is Galaxy Brain. For the last few weeks, I’ve been obsessing over a question, the answer to which may be impossible to know: What do we do with this window we have to the world?

We’re living in this moment of genuine chaos in a decade that’s already been full of global conflicts, a botched insurrection, a pandemic, political dysfunction. All of that colliding on an internet full of conspiracy theorizing, synthetic AI slop, endless memes. Our phones bring us delights and numbing distractions, but also fresh horrors every day.

Maybe you, like me, woke up last week and found yourself faced with a series of auto-playing videos of agents mobbing Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Maybe you watched as an agent shot him while he lay on his knees on the street. Or maybe a few weeks ago, your phone showed you the amateur video taken from multiple angles of Renee Good’s last moments before she was shot by an ICE agent at close range. Or maybe you logged on this fall and had to witness Charlie Kirk’s gruesome assassination in your feed.

Social media has enabled us to vicariously witness terrifying scenes. This is especially true in recent weeks in the Twin Cities. Sometimes we seek them out, but other times they find us in moments when we’re especially unprepared to see them. A colleague of mine recounted checking his phone and accidentally stumbling upon an auto-play video of Pretti Saturday morning while at the aquarium with his daughter.

A reality of being alive in 2026 is that you may accidentally open your phone and witness a man being shot to death and then have to figure out how to continue on with your day. The cognitive dissonance here is extremely difficult to sit with. To say nothing of the psychological trauma of witnessing such violence, even if you’re able to stay away from the worst of it. Watching armed, masked agents pulling elderly people out of their homes in the cold or detaining young children—that takes a toll, especially when you close your device and you find yourself back in your own life. The world feels on fire, and your life is just moving on.

It can feel alienating, and it can make a person feel so angry, sad, and ultimately powerless. And yet, the power of this kind of documentation—the kind that’s being performed by observers in Minnesota every day, who are risking their lives to film clashes between agents and protestors—that cannot be understated.

Pretti’s last seconds were captured from multiple angles in sickening footage that was widely distributed on social media and news organizations. It is able, though, to be seen and dissected online precisely because of the observers who were there to document it, who did not drop their phones when the gunshots rang out, and who kept recording when federal agents piled atop Pretti. All of it has had an immediate effect, in countering the administration’s smears that Pretti was a “would-be assassin” who “tried to murder federal law enforcement.” The news and the footage of Pretti’s death managed to break through the usual informational chaos.

On Reddit and Instagram and Facebook pages, the videos of Pretti’s last moments appear to have galvanized people who don’t normally engage or post about politics at all. You have sports-meme pages and golf influencers. The climbing subreddit, knitting accounts, not-safe-for-work pages. I mean, even a Facebook page as apolitical as the “Gravestones of New England” was calling out ICE’s excessive force in the aftermath.

Something has changed.

All of this underscores that if the truth is ever going to win out over propaganda, it can only do so in the face of overwhelming evidence—the collection of which has become ever more treacherous in the second year of Trump’s second presidency.

You can understand the power of documentation and of witnessing, but you can also struggle with how to consume it all yourself. I’m reminded of this great and sobering essay by The New York Times writer Amanda Hess. It’s about witnessing sensitive content videos on Instagram from the conflict in Gaza: this wrenching series of videos and photos of dead children, all on an app dominated by ads and influencers and algorithmically chosen photos of friends doing fun stuff.

Of that, she wrote, “Sometimes, when I tap on a post from a journalist in Gaza, Instagram suggests next steps. ‘Are you sure you want to see this video?’ it asks. It tries to point me instead to ‘resources’ for coping with ‘sensitive topics.’ It suggests a crisis hotline for disaster survivors and responders, but I am not a survivor or a responder. I’m a witness, or a voyeur. The distress I am feeling is shame.”

What Hess is getting at here in part is how what we might witness on our devices isn’t just traumatizing or radicalizing, but it’s also linked explicitly to the specific platforms that serve this content up to us. And these platforms are incredibly fraught curators. Many of them are owned by billionaires with their own political agendas. For example, late last week, TikTok finalized the sale of its U.S. operations to an American investor group. And that includes, among others, Oracle, the private-equity firm Silver Lake, and the investment firm MGX.

Now, this became relevant over the weekend when Pretti was killed, because influencers attempted to upload videos to the platform, criticizing ICE. And some found that they couldn’t do that. Others got the videos up, but noticed they’d received zero views. And that was very suspect. So many of them naturally took to social media to express their outrage. They said that they’d been censored by the new leadership. “With Larry Ellison’s takeover, TikTok is already silencing voices on the left and anti-ICE, anti-Trump content.” That was what the popular podcast I’ve Had It posted on X on Monday morning.

This is just a perfect encapsulation of this moment, right? TikTok noted that it had suffered a data-center outage and that user uploads and views had been affected. The transfer of ownership from ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, to the U.S. ownership group, paired with a data-center outage, might mess with the platform. That’s an entirely plausible scenario. There’s also the fact that nonpolitical content on the platform, like posts from the NFL’s primary account, also showed zero views on Monday, which suggests a broader issue here. But others just refuse to believe that. The only thing in this that is clear right now is that there are so many people who are extremely and understandably wary of TikTok’s ownership and seem to assume at all times that somebody’s thumbs are on the scales.

All of this makes the job of being an informed citizen just tortured. Do you stare at the misery machine? If so, how much? What do you take from it? Is the misery machine real life? Is it not real life? “Don’t be a doomer!” they say. “But also don’t underreact!” The truth out there is probably as bad, maybe even worse, than you think. But if you remove yourself from it all, it’s easy to slip back into something that is like complacency. It is crucial to pay attention right now. It’s also crucial not to lose resolve or get sucked in or traumatize yourself. There’s a real world out there. Touch grass, people say. The real world is likely full of people around you who tether you to your community. People you love, and who love you. But the trauma in our screens—that is also the real world.

So what are we supposed to do with this window to the world? It is such an unanswerable and essential question right now. Sometimes it seems like this window has only made people grow apart, more callous, more self-interested, more addled. And yet that very same window often shows us that people are good and decent and that they care about each other and organize and have these huge reservoirs of empathy.

We’ve seen that in Minnesota this month. So with all that, how should you or I—how should we all—think about posting and consuming and being a good citizen in the information war? To answer that, I spoke with Amanda Litman. She’s the co-founder and president of Run for Something, which is an organization that recruits and supports young and diverse progressive candidates running for down-ballot office. She’s the author of multiple books, including When We’re in Charge: The Next Generation’s Guide to Leadership. And most recently, she’s been writing on her Substack about the ways that people and politicians can calibrate themselves to the internet to feel some agency and make a difference in the world.

She joins me now to talk about it all.

[Music]

Warzel: Amanda, welcome to Galaxy Brain.

Litman: Thank you for having me.

Warzel: So you’ve been in politics awhile as an organizer, a digital strategist. And I get the sense from following you online that you’re a pretty online person, and that you’ve been closely following what’s been happening in Minnesota online. And so I want to start by getting a sense from you of what you’ve witnessed these past three weeks—what the experience has been like watching this—but then also what you’ve been seeing in terms of the broad effect of other people watching this collectively.

Litman: It’s been so interesting, because my algorithm very clearly knows who I am. It knows I like politics, it knows I work in politics, it knows I’m a mom. It’s nice to feel seen in some ways—

Warzel: —by Big Tech—

Litman: —recognition is recognition. But the people I follow are, generally speaking, people who work in politics, for the most part. Or people I’ve met through the political circle. Those folks have been tuned in since the beginning. What I have noticed over the last three weeks, both from the folks I follow from other parts of my life, but also from the cultural creators, especially from the parenting creators, from the book people, from the romance writers, from the other parts of my life that are not politics—and I think this has been true across the internet—is people feeling like the shooting of Alex Pretti is the last straw. That this is the thing where you cannot stay silent. And it has felt so reminiscent of 2020 in that way, in that there is a tipping point where the conversation cannot continue as normal. In a way that I have found shocking, to be honest.

Warzel: Yeah; it’s really wild to see it. I’ve seen it too, and I think a lot of people have remarked on this. In my other life, I like to play golf. And so I follow a lot of people who are golf influencers or whatever, or my algorithm gives me people like that. And that is usually a pretty, like, We’re staying out of politics crew of people, you know? And there was one image I saw posted online of a golf influencer. He’s just at a driving rage, just hitting a shot. And he’s like, This normally wouldn’t be a political account, but golf is political because you can’t play it if you get shot by an agent of the state in the street. And it was like this moment for me of, This has bled through in a really, really shocking way.

Litman: It feels like the conversation has shifted from it being a thing that political people are talking about to a thing that everyone is talking about—in a way that doesn’t feel like it’s happened, honestly, since Jimmy Kimmel was fired. Which feels like the last big cultural moment that sort of broke through, at least in the online space.

Warzel: And so you wrote this piece—this is one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you today—about the politics of posting, and this idea of what we do on these platforms, whether it matters. But I think that this is a great context for it—this idea that there has been this shift. And you wrote it, I think, before Alex Pretti was shot, a day or two before. And you started the piece by describing seeing this now-famous photo of this 5-year-old boy who was detained by ICE. In the image, he’s wearing this little backpack and this hat. And it’s an extremely, I think, difficult thing for anyone to see—but especially a lot of parents. It really broke through online. And you talked about posting that image yourself on your own platforms in order to put some pressure on ICE or raise awareness here. And then you wrote, “But: Did my posting (or any of our posting, on any platform) do anything to further that effort?” Walk me through your process there. Did it?

Litman: Yes and no. I’m not sure if I actually wrote this, but I have come full circle here. Used to be, back in my digital-strategist days—so when I worked for the [Barack] Obama campaign in 2012, that was my first job out of college. I was doing online fundraising. I then did digital strategy for the [Florida] governor’s race and then did online fundraising for Hillary [Clinton]. I was kind of, maybe counterintuitively, Posting doesn’t matter. It is important in that it is participatory, but it doesn’t change things. It’s like, It’s not enough. You can’t just post and be like, “Great job; done!”

Over the last now 10 years of the work I’ve done in seeing how things have shifted, I have moved my barometer for success a little bit. I think in this moment, as you have written so much about, there is no singular media source. Everyone is getting a slightly different algorithm, a slightly different, fractured media diet. They’re seeing something a little bit different. So if I post the picture of Liam Ramos or the headlines from the Minneapolis paper, it might be the only thing that someone sees about that story if they follow me. Even though it feels like my entire newsfeed is 100 percent that, it might be the only thing. And there’s actually some really interesting research about this, that I think Wired wrote about in December: how political content posted by nonpolitical creators has more influence than political creators doing it. Like, it does more to move people to the left, in part because of the parasocial relationship that people have with folks who are talking about golf or parenting or books or whatever it might be.

And like, I’m not a creator; you’re not a creator. We’re not influencers in that same way. Although maybe we are, which is sort of a separate conversation.

Warzel: We’re all creators now.

Litman: But that idea that you—as a trusted source for your friends, your family—they know you. They know where you’re coming from. Seeing you speak up about it—“you” in the broad sense—that can be really, really powerful. And it takes the place of having a conversation in person, that most people are a little bit too afraid to have these days.

Warzel: It’s such a great point about the influencer thing. When you look at—I think this is something, and we can get into this a little later down the line—but when you think about how different ideologies have harnessed the media. Like, there was this whole long conversation after the 2024 election of Who is the Joe Rogan of the left?, right? And the smartest people on this subject who study this type of stuff, who really understand these dynamics, all said, You can’t create that. Because Joe Rogan is a guy who is a standup comedian who started a podcast about standup comedy where he interviewed comedians, then got into mixed martial arts and did that, and built this huge audience that loved and trusted him for whatever reason. And then he started to get interested in conspiracy theories, and then politics. And all of the work that you do for a decade of building that trust in that audience, when you do turn on the politics jet—like as you said—this is such a powerful source for people who have that relationship with them. And I think that it’s really interesting to think about with our social feeds. This happening in a very, one-to-one, very kind of community-level aspect. I think that’s really, really smart.

Litman: Well, and I think there’s a hesitation that some people have, especially after the last five years, of like, I don’t just want to post and have, like, performative activism. I don’t just want to do virtue signaling. I think virtue signaling is good. I think it is good to want to show people you’re a good person. And I write this, like, it feels a little self-righteous. It can be a little bit annoying. But one, the right has tried to make vice signaling very cool. They have tried to make being an asshole and a bigot and a piece of shit on the internet the hot, cool thing, and shame you if you’re a good person. I think that’s dumb. We should be proud of being, of doing good things. And it should be okay to post things that signal your values. And I will tell you, as somebody who runs a nonprofit, if you’re making the donation so that you get the receipt to share: I don’t care. That money spends all the same. It doesn’t matter why you’re doing it, as long as you are doing it and actually taking action in a meaningful way that moves the needle forward.

Warzel: You write that it could also be a way to find your people. I think a lot of people don’t believe that. But can you give the case for finding community through some of these platforms and networks?

Litman: I mean, it’s hard for me personally to articulate this, because everyone knows I work in politics. This is my life. But I hear this from the people who engage with this material all the time, which is like—it’s so validating to see someone say something or post something you agree with in a way that might surprise you. Like, I didn’t know that writer felt that way. I didn’t know that creator felt that way. And especially for people in real life, like, I didn’t know that fellow parent at school that I only follow because we see each other at the playground every so often feels similarly. Now we can have a conversation. Now maybe next time I want to volunteer in a campaign, I could reach out to them.

It often can feel either like screaming into the void or preaching to the choir. But at least when it comes to preaching to the choir, you might reach someone who just didn’t feel like they could sing loud enough, and you might encourage them to speak up. And it feels so cringey to say out loud. It really does. And I get that. But in this moment—especially with the propaganda war that the government is trying to instill—it really, really matters that there’s a different kind of dispersion of information.

Warzel: I think there’s something to the cringey thing. I’ve heard other people say this, so this is not a deeply original thought, but: I think, broadly speaking, the whole idea of cringe is really, I think, toxic. The idea of labeling everything as this. In the same way that virtue signaling is good when the world is full of this vice signaling, when there is a terminal irony that is basically poisoning all these different platforms—and the White House posts like they’re a 4chan moderator or something like that—I feel like cringe is good. Bring us some cringe, right? Because it basically just means you care a lot. And I think that that is something that I would like to see more people not be afraid to show. That they’re caring in that way.

Litman: Rachel Karten had a thing, I think it was last week, about like the Mister Rogersification of marketing this year, of how more and more brands and marketing are moving into Mister Rogers vibes in their social media and leaning into this idea of kindness and hope. And I have been thinking about this a lot, even in 2025. Like, my hottest take is: I think that the Democratic nominee in 2028 is going to be whoever can appropriately balance fight like hell with kindness and joy. I don’t know if you ever see that meme that’s like “The people yearn for Glee.” They just want Glee to be on. We want that Glee joy, like the television show. There is something real to that. It is nice to see nice things. Fear and rage, it just burns you out. Whereas when you remember that people care, and they believe that better things are possible, it makes you feel like you can get out of bed in the morning.

Warzel: Not to put you on the spot, but are there good examples of brands or whatever that have done this? Successfully pivoting to the cringe slightly, or the Mister Rogersification?

Litman: Okay, so I’m gonna quote from Rachel Karten’s newsletter, because I thought it was … like it really spoke to me. She talks about a Nurses Week video from Fig. She talks about Elmo: just checking in, how’s everybody doing? There’s a post from Willy Chavarria, who’s a fashion designer, leaning into the sort of joy that people are experiencing. I think you see this a lot with content creators in particular, talking about the beautiful things in their life. Like, the aesthetics of happiness feel really engaging.

Warzel: And that speaks a little, though, to the tension here, right? I know a lot of people who—I know somebody, a friend, just happens to be, they planned their one vacation for the year, you know, a year ago. And it just happens to be during this time in American life that is just awful and very chaotic, and feels just like, you know, something has shifted and changed. And there’s this, I think everyone makes all these different calculations of Do I post a photo of the beach? Like, Am I a bad person if I’m doing this? And I think it’s interesting to think of it from this lens of, you don’t want to say “The world just goes on,” right? But there is this way of thinking—that sharing and joy. And, I don’t know, there’s a way that you can create community that feels a little generative, as opposed to the constant soul-sucking nature of We are on the brink.

Litman: And not to bring everything in social media and politics back to Zohran Mamdani, but I do think this is something Mamdani did so, so well—which was that his stuff was joyful. Like, it was heavily layered with Millennial optimism and a little bit of cringe in a way that really, especially, spoke in opposition to the way that [Andrew] Cuomo or anyone else was campaigning. If you believe that better things are possible and you are inherently an optimist—because I think to participate in activism, you have to be a little bit of an optimist, even if you hate that about yourself—it is contagious. Because it’s what gives you the forward momentum to keep doing the work. So I had a friend who was doing that too; was like, I just was surfing in Costa Rica, and the world is falling apart. Can I post? I was like, Yeah, of course you can. Because the next day you’ll be back, you know, donating and marching and doing what you can. Post away.

Warzel: Or shoveling snow and doomscrolling; yeah. I wanted to ask broadly, we’ve touched on this in a lot of ways. But something that I have thought so much about—and, to be very candid, like agonized about for the last decade—is: What do we do with this window to the world that we have? I think whether it’s seeing atrocities abroad, as we have for so long, or the dysfunction here at home, there’s a feeling right now that part of just being alive today is being confronted with auto-playing videos of people being shot to death. And that’s something that I think is beyond just being hyper online. If you are in these spaces at all, you may be confronted with fresh, genuine horrors—that if you open yourself to them fully, it’s easy to shut down or to feel just so alienated, because you are going throughout your day, in the way that you are. I’m curious how you think about how we bear witness. How we think about showing and sharing these things with people because they matter to us, and how not to get demoralized in doing so.

Litman: One of my general rules of thumb for online-content consumption, especially as it relates to the news, is to only take the poison I have the antidote for.

Warzel: I love that.

Litman: I can’t always do this. But generally speaking, that means that there are huge parts of the things happening in the world that I just like, I scroll past. There’s nothing I can do about that. That doesn’t mean it’s not important. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter. It’s just the things that I have chosen to dedicate my life and my career and my work to, and my personal outside-of-work interests to, are not that. Now the things that I have—like what is happening in Minneapolis, like what’s happening in the United States, like what’s happening with Trump, like what’s happening in New York City, where I live—yeah, I’m diving deep. But you know what? That’s because I can do something about it. Whether that’s voting in an election, giving money, subscribing to media, thinking about all the different sort of things I could do that affect it. Pick the poison I’ve got the antidote for. And I think the key is remembering that the antidotes, to extend the metaphor a little bit, are more varied than you might think.

I was talking to someone who was telling me they felt so hopeless about what was happening in Minneapolis. They’re like, There’s nothing I can do. This person was like, I’ve worked in politics, worked as a facilitator. It’s so hard, but there’s nothing I can do. I was like, You live in D.C. There’s a D.C. mayoral election in the upcoming year. It actually is going to be really, really, really important who the D.C. mayor is, because this shit is going to come back to your city soon enough. Like, dedicate all of your energy to that. And that—while it might not feel like a direct solution to what’s happening in Minneapolis—that is a solution, and it’s a concrete thing you could do. It’s a thing you can show up in person for. It’s a thing you’ll be able to live the results of. Be expansive in what your idea of antidote is, and it allows you, I think, a little bit more possibility.

Warzel: We’re talking a lot about the personal-political media consumption, how to be online as a person. We’ve also touched, but I want to go deeper on, the idea of politicians and being online. You’ve written a lot about leadership, especially in younger generations: about ways that people can leverage these platforms to connect, to get messages out, but also to inspire people to affect actual political change. And something that I feel, and I think a lot of people feel, is that there are really just—especially when you look at, say, our politicians, they fall into two camps. They’re either hyper-online, really cocooned, troubling edgelords. Or you have people who are kind of thinking and regarding the internet on dial-up terms, right? You’ve said that we need to find elected officials who are the right amount of online. What is the right amount of online for an elected official?

Litman: So I think it’s folks who are enough of a consumer that they can be a producer without the brain rot. Like, J. D. Vance has brain rot. Trump has brain rot. Like, they’re so online that they’re unable to see that it is an ecosystem—an echo chamber that they cannot get out of. They’re sucked into it. And I think there’s actually a lot of, you know, Republican electeds, candidly, who—whether it’s Twitter or Fox News—same idea. Like, there’s not some secret source of information. They’re doing the same shit. We saw that in the photo from the Venezuela attack, or coup, I guess. Where they’re scrolling Twitter as they’re, you know, kidnapping dictators.

Warzel: Right. This is the, sort of, not Situation Room, but the Mar-a-Lago command center during the Venezuela raid, where they are conducting an operation. And Pete Hegseth has a screen behind him that is showing a Twitter feed, or an X feed.

Litman: That is too online. And then, as you say, the politicians who clearly have no idea how the internet works; don’t understand. They don’t know the language of a forward-facing video, so they can’t do it in a way that feels genuine or authentic. Which means they can’t communicate in this moment. That is 80 percent of a politician’s job—is communication. And if they can’t do it in the way that works for 2026, they can’t be a good politician right now. You’ve got some politicians, I think, like AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], Maxwell Frost—I actually think Chris Murphy and Brian Schatz, it’s not all younger—like the ones who are online enough that they know how to use the tools. Even if they don’t actually know how to, like, edit the video themselves. While still understanding that the internet is not real life, but it is a huge part of your life for a ton of people, and it is how people understand real life. Like, it’s a mediation for how we will understand real life.

Warzel: When you see something good from a politician, like a piece of content that they’ve produced or a response, what are some of the flavors of that? Like, what is a taxonomy of a good response or a good post from an elected official? How does that work for you?

Litman: Does it feel like it credibly could have come from them? Do I buy that this is a thing? That even if, like I said, like their Zoomer digital staffer told them, Hey, this is a thing you should have, you should make, we’re gonna edit it—does it feel like it credibly could have come from them? Does it feel like they’re responding to a post that they probably could have seen? Does it look like they’re copy-pasting talking points they’ve been emailed? Which you see politicians often do, and then forget to delete the copy-paste notes on top of, which is such a flag. How much did their staff have to explain to them the format, the function, how it works? One of my favorite questions to ask politicians of any age, but especially the older ones, is “Tell me about what side of the internet you’re on.” What side of TikTok are you on? What Reddit subreddits are you in? Are you on Pinterest? Are you on Ravelry, if you’re a knitter? I don’t know; tell me about the internet that you’re on. And the ones who don’t even understand the question are the ones who are not well suited for this moment.

Warzel: It’s interesting. I once asked—I had an opportunity via The New York Times editorial board to interview Bernie Sanders, and my job was to ask him a tech question. And I was just like, Show me some of the apps on your phone. And he just yelled at me and said he doesn’t have any. And yet, somehow that works, right? Like somehow, there are some people, because he is authentic to that, like Hey man, like, miss me with all of this.

Litman: But you can tell the ones who are actually really good at it don’t do meme-y stuff. Like, they’re not making memes. They’re being, like, genuine personal communicators, who maybe are using different formats and functions. But I think part of it is they so clearly know themselves and know what they believe that the question becomes, What tactics am I using to communicate it? As opposed to, Which memes am I jumping on to become trendy?

Warzel: This is what I noticed, and other people pointed this out, about Mamdani. Again, politics aside. What was so—and also even beyond the “joy” part of it aside—what I thought was so interesting from a media perspective about some of his videos, especially the first ones that he did when he was out in Queens on the street, was he was taking a very popular online form of content. Which is the “man on the street asking random people, with a microphone in their face, some kind of question.” Right? And then that getting chopped up and put online. Like, that’s how we found Hawk Tuah Girl, who became like the other side of it. But he was just asking these questions, about like, Why did you vote for Donald Trump in 2024, right? And having that man-on-the-street thing. It’s that fluency with a type of content that people are familiar with, but it’s also a type of content that you can do in your own way that is not going to, or that is going to then spread naturally, right? Because the internet is primed to take that type of content and just get it out to a lot of different people. I thought that was a really great example of pairing form, regardless of even the politics, with something that is actually gonna spread.

Litman: Well, and that’s because he’s the right amount of online. Like, that’s a dude that has an FYP that is carefully calculated to his interests. And he’s talked about this. And I think that is telling of a guy who, at the very least, knows the language. Like, he can speak enough of it that he can get by. And I think that is true for so many of the politicians who are really effective in this moment—is they’re good enough. They’ve done enough days on Duolingo to get by.

Warzel: They’re not being guilted by the Duolingo owl logo. That’s very important, I think, in general. So if you could give advice—and I’m sure you are—but if you could give advice to the Democrats right now. And that’s even just like in choosing candidates, like how important is that part of it, like the online strategy in assessing overall whether a candidate’s gonna be good. Obviously you don’t want a candidate who is just hyper online and great at it and, you know, not good at the realpoliticking or whatever. But how do you—how should they judge that? That category “being online”?

Litman: I don’t want to say it’s everything. But I think it is a bigger part than most people would like to admit, because I think, one, it’s how people get information. But two—as we learned with Joe Biden—if you cannot effectively sell the good stuff you’re doing, it doesn’t matter how good the stuff is. Like, you’ve got to be able to continually communicate in all the ways people get information, in all of the platforms. And part of that is being sufficiently online.

But it’s also being a normal person who can show up in nonpolitical spaces and still be a normal person. I think a lot about how many members of Congress could credibly go on basically any nonpolitical podcast—chat show, influencer—and not sound like a robot. Maybe a dozen? If you’re being generous. Which doesn’t mean they’re bad people or bad politicians or bad legislators. It just means that the skillset for what you need to be an effective leader in 2026 is not the same skillset that you needed in 1990 or 2000 or even 2010, when a lot of these folks got elected. And I think it’s the same thing that you’re seeing CEOs struggle with, too: where if you are too online as a CEO, you will suffer. But if you’re not online enough, you’re not gonna know how to perpetuate the brand; you’re not going to know how to sell the work. You’re not going to know even how to influence internal communication, which is driven off of external communication, in many ways. It really matters.

Warzel: Something that I really appreciate about your writing on this entire subject is always that it draws back to IRL, right? It’s always focused on the idea of actual civic engagement, actual community. The stuff that we do online driving change in the real world. You’ve written about things —you’ve written a long list on one of your Substacks of things that people can do. Some of it is political; some of it is civic engagement and relationship building. Can you tell me some of the things that you have found most helpful in just building community, and giving people just a broader sense of agency?

Litman: Go to a city-council or school-board or library-board meeting. Go to a state legislative hearing. Go to a neighborhood cleanup. Stock your neighborhood fridge, if it has a free fridge. Participate in mutual aid. Support a local artist. Buy something from a local artist. Share the thing that you bought online, so that more people can buy things from that local artist. Subscribe to local media. Bring a dish to someone who just had a baby or lost a loved one, or just because. Start a neighborhood group chat. Sustain the neighborhood group chat and make sure it’s not that annoying. My favorite one—and I’ve written about this a lot, it’s sort of like the other thing that I’ve been clinging to this year—

Warzel: I think I was gonna ask you about this one. Is this your experiment?

Litman: Yeah.

Warzel: Tell the people.

Litman: In 2025, and I’ve written about this a bunch and talked about it lately, my husband and I—in order to combat our new-parent isolation—decided to host people for dinner every Saturday in 2025. Every Saturday we were in town, which since we started the year with a 2-year-old and a two-month-old, was every Saturday, because we didn’t travel with them. And we ended up succeeding. We had 52 dinners. More than 100-some-odd people came to our home over the year, 40-some-odd kids. And it was hard in many cases, but so magical. And as I think about, like, Okay, what happens when ICE comes to New York—which they will, they are, I see it in the neighborhood chats already. Like, When they send tanks rolling down Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn—not a crazy thing to say might happen at some point in the next couple years—who are the people that I’m gonna text? Who are the people I’m gonna turn to? It’s the folks who’ve come over to my home for dinner, and their friends, and their networks. I described it as the most political thing I did in 2025. And I am a political operative who voted in two different elections in 2025—thank you, New York City—and give money and read and engage. Having people over for dinner was the most political thing I did. And as I read about what’s happening in Minneapolis, I feel even more affirmed in that. Like, building strong relationships with the people around you is what will get us through this.

Warzel: What did you learn about being social in 2025, 2026? This era where people do feel really isolated a lot? There is a quote-unquote “loneliness epidemic,” however you want to describe it. What did you learn about being social from having 52 dinners at your house?

Litman: One, that it really surprised people to be invited over. People were shocked that we were inviting them into our home. Two, that the tone that we set really mattered. How casual could we make it? I’d often text people morning of to be like, Hey, just FYI, one of my children is not wearing pants and I’m still in my pajamas. See you later. Like, being really aggressive about making it clear—this is not fancy; this is as real as it can get. Because it’s all we can do at this stage in our lives. But come into our home anyway.

I would say some of the questions that I’ve gotten since I’ve written about this and posted about it—because always be posting—really have stunned me. People would ask, like, So what did you talk about? Books, movies, vacations, our kids, the dog, all kinds of things. But I do think that social muscle—and I don’t mean to embarrass anyone by saying that, it’s a real question—that social muscle has so clearly atrophied, and you so deeply overthink it to the point that you have forgotten that actually you can just let go. Not to Mel Robbins you, but you can just let it go.

Warzel: You know, I love—I’m probably butchering it, but I believe it’s like a [Kurt] Vonnegut quote. I think it’s like, The humans were put on this earth to to fart around is the quote, right? And it’s like, I think about that. I thought of it when I read your post, and I think about it sometimes when I am out with my community, engaging in whatever. And a lot of that time is like … it’s not structured, right? It’s not like, “Here’s the list of what we’re gonna talk about today, and the eight political actions we’re gonna take, and the 12 things.” It’s like, I almost sometimes can’t remember what we talked about, right? But it’s this, leave with this feeling of, like, That was so great and unproductive, because it was unproductive. It’s like a wonderful thing. And it feels like it’s something that we just like, we need to have. Just that unstructured hang.

Litman: It’s really hard to be on your phone when it’s just four or six people in your house hanging out and having dinner, drinking wine, whatever it might be. Which I think is also big part of this; it’s two or three hours in which I am not on the internet. And I wish that was more of my life. I wish I was better about not being on my phone. But like, especially when people are over, it is so valuable to unplug. So valuable.

Warzel: Well, I think we will let people unplug by wrapping this. Amanda, thank you.

Litman: Excellent segue.

Warzel: I’m trying. This is still new to me here. We’re working on it. Amanda, this is lovely. Thank you so much for helping people try to understand how to use these tools to feel like a person in the world, instead of being tossed by the algorithmic winds. Thank you so much.

Litman: Well, it’s my pleasure. I would just say—I know it feels bad. We’re winning. We’re going to win. I think that’s the thing I’ve taken away from the last couple days of the internet. It’s like—they’re not popular. What they’re doing is not popular. They’re getting cat-bongo Reddit subthreads to vocally disagree with them. They are not popular. This is terrible, but we will win. And I find that to be really comforting.

Warzel: Amanda, thank you so much. Really appreciate it.

Litman: Thanks.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, suggests his group has receded from street protests because the Department of Homeland Security is now performing similar roles. The article argues that the second Trump administration has effectively institutionalized the tactics of extremist militias within federal agencies like ICE and Border Patrol, using mass-deportation teams to intimidate immigrants and left-wing activists with militaristic force.

        <hr/>
        “We’ve kind of gotten what we want, right? There’s no reason to fucking protest,” Enrique Tarrio, a longtime leader of the Proud Boys, told me earlier this week over the phone while he was taking a minute to charge his Tesla. We were speaking about why his group had receded from the streets. His answer: He no longer felt compelled to show up with other Proud Boys to fight left-wing protesters, because the federal government was doing the job itself.

A year ago, it seemed that the Proud Boys and other right-wing extremists were poised for a renaissance. These groups had been in a lull because much of their leadership, including Tarrio, was imprisoned for involvement in the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. But at the beginning of his second term, President Trump issued pardons and commutations to some 1,500 of the rioters. Having once told the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by,” Trump has now effectively opened the way for extremist militias—with their signature assault rifles and tactical gear—to antagonize local populations, especially immigrants, as they had in Portland and elsewhere.

And indeed, groups of armed men have been roaming the streets intimidating immigrants, violently confronting protesters, and claiming an authority beyond the purview of state or local law enforcement. This time, though, the men belong to the Department of Homeland Security’s mass-deportation teams. Their tactics bear striking similarities to those of the Proud Boys and other militias that showed up in U.S. cities during Trump’s first term. Clad in the same tactical vests, cargo pants, sunglasses, and neck buffs pulled over their faces, some 3,000 federal agents deployed to the streets of Minneapolis with catastrophic results.

Homeland Security’s mandate, of course, is to protect the border, find people who are in the country illegally, and facilitate the deportation of undocumented immigrants, in theory targeting the “worst of the worst.” The Proud Boys showed up at events ostensibly to stand up for immigration enforcement, among other things. But often the result was fistfights with left-wing protesters and anti-fascists. The federal agents and militia members have displayed the common goal of relentless intimidation—of immigrants and the left—and have used militaristic tactics in their confrontations. (Both, too, are currently unpopular and out of step with the majority of the American public.)

These similarities aren’t a coincidence. They are a demonstration of how DHS and its agencies have melded the views and tactics of the extremist fringe with the apparatus and authority of the federal government. The White House, instead of giving the Proud Boys and others tacit permission to intimidate the left as it did in the first Trump administration, has effectively created its own in-house militia to replace the Proud Boys and harass their common opponents. Extremists have stepped out of the way to let ICE and Border Patrol do the work. When I asked DHS about this dynamic, Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s spokesperson, called the observation “irresponsible” and “shameful during a serious moment for our country.” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson similarly replied over email that “The Atlantic should be ashamed of themselves.”

“Immigration was a central and polarizing issue in 2016. It continues to be a central focus of the guys,” Tarrio told me. He described his group’s prior role as doing the things law enforcement wasn’t allowed to do in the first Trump administration. “There were times when the feds weren’t allowed to do their job,” Tarrio said. “Here, ICE is doing its job no matter what.”

ICE and the Border Patrol can pursue these aims with the resources that independent right-wing groups could only dream of. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed last summer, gave ICE $75 billion in extra funding. Both Vice President Vance and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller in recent months have said agents have legal immunity. The Department of Justice has done little to investigate agents’ actions, including the killing of two civilians, instead focusing on what officials claim the victims did wrong.

Legal experts doubt the immunity claim, and the administration this week somewhat softened its rhetoric and approach in Minneapolis. (Vance has since claimed that he never said “officers who engaged in wrongdoing would enjoy immunity.”) The agents who shot Alex Pretti are currently on administrative leave, and the administration’s border czar, Tom Homan, said yesterday that he plans to “draw down” ICE and Border Patrol’s presence in the city. Regardless, the administration’s comments suggest that agents will at least receive significant support for any legal challenges they may face over their actions.

The similarities among ICE, the Border Patrol, and the Proud Boys and similar groups have prompted the question of whether any Proud Boys have joined the agencies. Last month, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations published a report citing the account of an American citizen who had been detained by ICE, who claimed to have “noticed several of the agents had tattoos that expressed support for the Proud Boys.”

Tarrio was noncommittal when I asked him directly about Proud Boys in ICE. “I’m sure some of the guys have applied,” he told me, but added that “if they did join ICE, we’d probably be quiet about it, because they’d probably get fired if they were publicly a Proud Boy.”

Now that ICE and Border Patrol have left them with less to do, the Proud Boys have adjusted their tactics. Tarrio told me that he was considering going to Minneapolis in disguise, with a few other Proud Boys, for the purpose of “gathering a little bit of intelligence” on the people protesting ICE. When I last spoke with Tarrio, in September, he was in the midst of another plot that also did not involve having a visible presence: He and a small group of Proud Boys were organizing digital campaigns to get people fired from their jobs for making insensitive statements about Charlie Kirk’s assassination. (Tarrio’s ability to muster a large Proud Boys presence is in jeopardy given his past as a federal-government informant, and many no longer regard him as the group’s leader.)

But the extreme far-right ethos the Proud Boys espouse has seeped into the federal government. Nativist ideologies are driving immigration policy; the government is calling out and antagonizing specific communities of color, such as Haitians in Ohio and Somalis in Minnesota. DHS is disseminating white-supremacist propaganda on its official media channels.

That blurring of the lines is sowing the conditions for an uptick in political violence, which is already at its highest level in decades.

Sean Westwood, a professor and the director of the Polarization Research Lab at Dartmouth College, explained to me that state violence typically occurs in ways that can be processed and absorbed by the public, like a police officer clearly acting in self-defense or a prison executing a convict on death row. But these justifications don’t apply to the killings of Renee Good, who had turned the wheel of her car away from her assailant, and Pretti, who never drew a weapon and was disarmed before he was shot. The extra risk of such wanton actions by the state is the sparking of retaliatory violence, Westwood said, much as the National Guard killing of four Vietnam War protesters at Kent State University in 1970 triggered national unrest.

Tarrio told me he thinks ICE is doing a great job, and said retaliation from the left is the one thing that could potentially bring him and his fellow Proud Boys back out. Which raises the possibility that at some point in the future the government’s agents and Tarrio’s militia members could join forces on the streets of an American city.

        <hr/>
        Updated at 8:25 p.m. on January 30, 2026

Reporters, lawmakers, and ordinary Americans are poring over a deluge of new files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case today, following the latest release from the Department of Justice. This release is substantially larger than any previous ones, with 3 million pages of documents, more than 180,000 photos, and more than 2,000 videos, according to the DOJ. The website they were uploaded to—which has the elegant URL Justice.gov/Epstein—is not intuitive to operate and offers a search box as its primary navigation tool.

But a search box was the only thing many viewers needed, as they were diving into the files in pursuit of information on specific people—President Trump in particular. Thousands of the documents appear to mention Trump, though not all of them in any significant way (for example, The New York Times notes that some of the documents are copies of news articles that contain his name). When Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the file release earlier today, he said that the White House had “nothing to do” with their vetting and “no oversight.” The DOJ press release further emphasizes the independence of the process and says that “notable individuals and politicians were not redacted in the release of any files.” The only redactions, according to the release, were those made to protect victims and their families.

Reporters sifting through the files have found plenty of news. They’ve turned up a series of emails that Epstein wrote about Bill Gates and then sent to himself in 2013. In these, Epstein suggests that he helped Gates have extramarital affairs and expresses disgust that Gates would “discard” their friendship after asking Epstein to do things “that have ranged from the morally inappropriate to the ethically unsound” and “potentially over the line into illegal.” (The Gates Foundation has already issued a comment to the Times that the claims—“from a proven, disgruntled liar—are absolutely absurd and completely false.”) Many other notable people appear in the files, including Bill Clinton, who was also also in previously released photos. A number of the documents referencing Clinton are uncorroborated tips sent to the FBI. A friendly email exchange between Epstein and Elon Musk turned up, as did a reference to Kevin Warsh, Trump’s preferred candidate to replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair. (Both Bill and Hillary Clinton have refused to testify for the House Oversight Committee’s Epstein investigation, and they recently released a joint statement saying that they’ve already shared “the little information” they have about Epstein. Musk and Warsh did not immediately respond to requests for comment.)

The files about such a sensitive and complicated series of crimes could be released to the public only by way of a convoluted procedural process, but the process came to seem suspiciously convoluted to many Americans in large part because of the president’s many reversals and evasions. Before Trump returned to office, he expressed a somewhat relaxed attitude about the Epstein files. Asked on the Lex Fridman Podcast in September 2024 whether he would release them if he were reelected, he said, “Yeah, I’d be inclined to do the Epstein; I’d have no problem with it.” Early last year, to demonstrate his dedication to truth-telling and transparency, Trump invited MAGA influencers to the White House, where they received binders full of Epstein-related documents labeled Phase 1. But some of the influencers were chagrined to find that the files inside were not new.

Then, in May, Trump reportedly learned from Attorney General Pam Bondi that he himself was mentioned in the unreleased files. Two months later, his attitude about them had dramatically changed. When the FBI announced in July that it had reviewed all of its Epstein files and would not release any more after all—that there would be no Phase 2—both Trump’s enemies and the MAGA faithful were aghast. But Trump was defiant and dismissive. “This guy’s been talked about for years,” he said to a reporter. “Are people still talking about this guy, this creep? That is unbelievable.” His resistance to releasing any more information caused a schism among his supporters (and contributed to the resignation of his longtime ally Marjorie Taylor Greene) and set Congress up for an easy win. Lawmakers moved quickly to pass a law that required the release of all further documents by December 19. Now, weeks past the deadline, the file dump has arrived.

After months of rumors about why Trump so stridently demanded that everyone move on from the Epstein files (and speculation that anything else he did was an effort to distract from them), people immediately latched onto a six-page FBI memo included in the dump that, at least on the surface, seemed to lend credence to their darkest guesses. The memo contained a spreadsheet full of uncorroborated tips sent to law enforcement, many alleging Trump’s participation in violent sex crimes involving minors, and some including graphic descriptions of their allegations. The document—which has already been widely shared by politicians and political commentators—includes some brief details about how law enforcement followed up on the tips but not about whether the tips were resolved. It also includes a note that some of the reports were “second-hand information.” (Trump has downplayed his past relationship with Epstein and denied any wrongdoing.)

This spreadsheet was salacious enough on its own, but then it was briefly unavailable on the Justice Department’s website, prompting people who had already downloaded it to start re-uploading it to other sites, recirculating it on social media, and speculating that it had been deliberately pulled down for political reasons. “DOJ has since killed this link,” the reporter Jake Tapper wrote on Bluesky, sharing a screenshot of the memo. “This is what was there.” (The document is currently loading on the DOJ site without a problem.)

Reached for comment, the DOJ spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre told me that the FBI memo had been “down due to overload and is back online.” She did not immediately respond to a follow-up email asking for more detail. Baldassarre also directed me to a section of the original DOJ press release about these documents. It notes that everything that the FBI received from the public was covered under the scope of law and had to be released, even if the information was unvetted. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the press release continues. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Very neutral wording. (The White House’s press team referred me to this same release when I contacted them for comment.)

Trying to parse market reactions to world events can feel a bit like armchair psychology. Lately, investors seem to be holding something back—amid a barrage of potentially seismic decisions from the White House, markets have barely budged.

In moments of global instability, traders usually start selling. President Obama’s threats to Syria during his second term gave traders “jitters.” Trump’s escalating trade war with China during his first term deflated the stock market. And last spring, when Trump unveiled “Liberation Day”—a plan to impose punitive tariffs on dozens of foreign nations—the S&P 500 shed a record $5 trillion over two days. It remains the biggest market shock of the president’s second term so far.

But the reactions to three headlines from this past month tell a different story. When U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on January 3, reviving an old protocol for dominance in the Western Hemisphere, the markets held strong. When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell revealed on January 11 that he was under criminal investigation by the Justice Department, and that the central bank’s independence was potentially under threat, markets responded with startling calm. And when Trump proposed a raft of European tariffs on January 17, as part of an effort to seize Greenland from our Danish allies, the market reaction, although noticeable, was far from catastrophic.

The fact that traders haven’t reacted so dramatically to volatility in 2026 is partly the product of better-than-expected economic growth in 2025. Although consumer prices remain high and job growth is slow, most experts will tell you that the American economy is in pretty good shape: The S&P 500 grew 16.39 percent last year; unemployment, although higher than when Trump took office, is still relatively low; and inflation isn’t expected to balloon over the coming year. (Prophecies of a recession turned out to have been wrong.)

Traders are weighing Trump’s actions against that rosy backdrop, and have lately been acclimating to the president’s caprice. The “TACO” theory (short for “Trump Always Chickens Out”) emerged as a way to describe his tendency to overpromise. But the markets’ resiliency over the past month indicates a more all-encompassing anhedonia.

Ahead of the mission to extract Maduro from Caracas, Trump suggested that U.S. intervention in Venezuela was intended to free up the country’s oil reserves, which are thought to be the largest in the world. It seemed possible that American companies would barrel up those trillions of gallons of oil, increasing global supply and lowering prices—a boon for purchasers and a potential problem for the energy companies already facing an oversupply problem. But because this all unfolded early on a Saturday morning, and oil-futures trading doesn’t open until Sunday evening, investors had a slight buffer.

Josh Lipsky, the chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council, told me that energy traders understood pretty quickly that there wouldn’t be “some influx of oil coming on.” American oil companies were reluctant to pour money into Venezuela given the country’s crumbling infrastructure, its history of political instability, and the cost of refining its low-quality reserves. A protracted battle over the country’s leadership also seemed unlikely, meaning that the effects of Maduro’s capture would largely be felt locally. After a moment of initial uncertainty, the markets quickly recovered—a muted reaction to what could have been a much larger, and much costlier, event.

The revelation that the Justice Department had subpoenaed the Federal Reserve chair posed an entirely different sort of risk. In a video message announcing the news, Powell accused Trump of persecuting him over his refusal to lower interest rates as quickly as the president would like. The Fed is famously independent from daily politics, which is part of its strength, and the dollar’s strength; Trump’s attempt to assert control over it could have severe economic consequences. There was a chance that, after Powell’s announcement, traders would start to price in that danger.

But as with the Maduro operation, this happened on a weekend, and markets had a buffer. That same night, Trump distanced himself from the DOJ’s investigation, and Senator Thom Tillis (a member of the Senate banking committee) came out strongly against it. Krishna Guha, the vice chair of the investment-research firm Evercore ISI, told me that had those developments not occurred, the market could have “responded very violently.” But by Monday afternoon, traders had barely reacted.

Something about Trump’s social-media proposal to put tariffs on European nations spooked markets more than the investigation of Powell or the capture of Maduro. Once again, the news arrived on a weekend. When trading resumed, stocks did noticeably decline, and the dollar weakened—but the 2.1 percent dip in the S&P 500 was nothing close to what happened after the “Liberation Day” announcement. When the president reneged on his Greenland-tariff plan last week, markets steadied.

“I think that we got a little taste of how bad things would have been if the administration had continued along the escalation path,” Guha said. According to John Canavan, the lead market analyst at Oxford Economics, that initial dip was likely compounded by a spike in Japanese-long-term-bond yields. Investors may have also learned their lesson from the slight pullback that followed last year’s “Liberation Day” panic; some of those proposed tariffs were eventually paused, reduced, or delayed. Although many of the big ones remained in place, it became clear that Trump was essentially using the threat of economic devastation as a negotiation tactic.

The economists I spoke with stressed that although these three cases are distinct, on the whole, markets have become more inured to the Trump administration’s actions. For now, the fate of Americans’ 401(k)s is not tied to the president’s Truth Social account. But that could always change; just this week, the president wrote that the United States has deployed a “massive armada” to the Middle East in an attempt to force Iran to end its nuclear weapons program. Financial markets are in the business of pricing threats—and Trump will surely keep them coming.

        <hr/>
        Good evening.

On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June. That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings.

I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.

This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.

This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.

I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.

Thank you.
