        President Donald Trump’s intention to take control of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is at first glance a demonstration of pettiness that would, in the past, have been nearly unbelievable. But in this second Trump era, the move was inevitable. He’s declared his plan to rule over the center and to transform America’s singular cultural institution into an expression of his philistine tastes and urges.

“I have decided to immediately terminate multiple individuals from the Board of Trustees, including the Chairman, who do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture,” Trump wrote on social media. “We will soon announce a new Board, with an amazing Chairman, DONALD J. TRUMP!”

He will not be serving as chairman, which is how one might typically frame his recent announcement about taking on the unpaid role. Instead, his move suggests he may lord over its musicians and dancers to make sure they comply with his definition of patriotism and his ratings-driven instincts. He seems to want a scrutiny of performances to ensure that they are appropriately non-diverse and anti-inclusive. The Kennedy Center will become a meritocracy based on Trump’s personal standards of greatness.

The president doesn’t merely want to break the government bureaucracy. He wants to reprogram what the arts mean to the American people.

He is coming after their heart. Their imagination. Their elusive spirit.

He already has purged the board of folks recently appointed by President Joe Biden. He has enlisted his ally Richard Grenell as interim executive director. Trump has done this, he said, because he believes the center is poorly run and found that the shows are terrible, mostly because they are too “woke.” If the good Lord could just purge the word “woke” from the English language, the Almighty will have done the country a fine service. But for now, woke is the word. Which in this instance, references to a handful of drag shows that people could choose to attend or simply ignore. Trump did neither.

He has never attended a Kennedy Center performance, but he could not resist an opportunity to be indignant. He admitted his lack of familiarity with the Kennedy Center to reporters on Air Force One. “I didn’t want to go,” he said. “There was nothing I wanted to see.”

During his first term, which began alongside the center’s 2017-2018 season, Trump never took in the National Symphony Orchestra. He did not attend a performance of “Hamilton” or “The Book of Mormon.” Over four years, he did not take an opportunity to relax with a comedy performance. He never took his grandchildren to a performance of “The Nutcracker.” He was so incurious that he ignored the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, which is one of the most acclaimed and successful troupes in the world; its classic “Revelations” tells a story of American history.

Trump did not attend the Kennedy Center Honors. He did not sit in the presidential box and applaud the honorees, those men and women who have given their professional lives to the arts and who are exemplars of talent, tenacity and merit. Some of those honorees made it clear that they had no desire to be celebrated by Trump. In 2017, dancer Carmen de Lavallade, singer Lionel Richie and television producer Norman Lear all signaled their reticence to attend the traditional White House reception during Honors weekend, after Trump’s tepid denunciation of the white supremacy march in Charlottesville that year. In return, the White House announced that Trump and the first lady would skip that year’s Honors.

He continued to avoid the Kennedy Center for the rest of his term and thereafter. He was never the bigger man. He never allowed the public to see him lean on the arts for solace, balm or enlightenment. He has never given any indication that the arts have touched his soul or opened his mind. What the country knows about the president’s cultural tastes is that he loathes drag performances and can’t get enough of Lee Greenwood, the Village People and cartoon wrestlers. So be it. The president isn’t raising his hand to be a cultural critic.

Instead, Trump is setting himself up to be the culture police. That’s tantamount to regulating the degree to which people are encouraged to think broadly, to conceive of ways to make the impossible a reality, to marvel at the fragile majesty of nature, to protest, to laugh, to find cathartic release. To dream with abandon. That is the power of the arts, after all.

The government, through its laundry list of policies and proposals, can depress the arts in myriad ways, by making it more difficult for arts organizations to sustain themselves, by pricing artists out of their communities, by making audiences jump through needless hurdles of taxes and fees to engage with expressions of creativity. But that’s all paperwork, budgets and real estate. What Trump is taking aim at is the way in which people think about themselves and others — about everyone’s place within this country.

At their best, the arts help people to think more deeply and more broadly. They help people grasp commonalities across expansive divides. Sometimes they highlight the greatness of man, but more often and more powerfully, they remind people of their fallibility. And for Trump, with his jaw set and his eyes focused solely on greatness, fallibility is unthinkable.

It’s impossible to consider Trump’s desire to control the Kennedy Center without thinking of his recent bullying tactics that had the National Endowment for the Arts cut a grant fund aimed at supporting underserved communities and instead prioritizing those projects aimed at celebrating the country’s 250th birthday. The overarching message? Inclusivity and patriotism are mutually exclusive.

He has purged the Smithsonian Institutions of references to diversity. Harangued the National Gallery of Art out of mentioning inclusivity. He wants to delete modernist and contemporary architecture from the federal city, which is to say that he is not simply concerned with how and where citizens work but the way in which they think about themselves in relationship to the state. He wants his buildings to be grand, so that its occupants feel small and inconsequential.

But his assault on the Kennedy Center is different. It’s not about a change in policy or a rewriting of grant requirements. He’s not complaining about budgets. It’s really not even about disliking the art, because Trump hasn’t actually seen or heard it. He just doesn’t like the idea of it. The thought of it.

        <hr/>
        On the Saturday night that the storm hit Mississippi, we had dripped our faucets for the temperature drop and stockpiled flashlights, groceries, extra blankets. By 11:30 p.m., my husband was pulling on his rain boots and heading outside to tarp our heating unit: “A branch has already fallen onto a power line in our backyard,” he told me. Three hours later, I was shaken awake. “Mom, I think a tree just fell on our house,” my 13-year-old son said. I stumbled around, looking for any sign that tree branches had breached my home. As I searched, I saw the pine tree behind our home drop a giant branch into the neighbor’s yard.

Crack. Boom. For the next six or so hours, every few minutes, we heard tree branches cracking, encased in ice and barreling to the ground like meteorites, exploding on contact with the earth. At each crack, we thought, Will this be the one that hits our house? Or our neighbors’? Will we lose our giant oak tree? Under the weight of five blankets and three sleeping bags, we waited for the storm to pass, for daylight to break, and for the fate of our town to become clear.

We know warm-weather storms in the South. Tornado sirens and weather alerts send us to shelter in our bathtub from spring into summer, when hurricane season begins and then runs into fall. We rarely get a break, yet something keeps us in place. My family and I live in Water Valley, a small town of about 3,400 in the Hill Country, just under 20 miles from Oxford, where I grew up. As a young child, often surrounded by oaks, pines, sycamores, cedars, and more, I found comfort and beauty in the trees. Many of the old trees in Mississippi have been preserved simply because no one had reason to cut them down. So much of the state is undeveloped, and that has allowed nature to be still and simply continue to live. My childhood house backed up to Bailey’s Woods, which connects the University of Mississippi to Rowan Oak, the home of William Faulkner. I’d build forts hidden deep in the woods or follow a shortcut to campus to get a milkshake from the cafeteria. I knew the trails so well that I could walk home at dusk without a flashlight.

Last Sunday morning, I began to assess the damage. I opened the front door, and the undeniable smell of pine trees hit my son and me in the face. My neighbors, whose home is flanked by pines, were now trapped by them. Their driveway was impassable, with broken branches everywhere. I heard the sound of a chainsaw down the street: Someone was already working to clear downed branches covering the road. A few neighborhood kids had wasted no time and were at the top of the hill in front of my house, hopping on bright green disc sleds, hopeful that the ice on the road would be as fun as snow.

In the backyard, two neighbors were looking up at the pine and its scattered branches. Another neighbor’s fence was now mangled metal covered in tree parts. I saw that we had lost a smaller tree, too, and a pine tree branch had pierced its fallen body, now split in half. When I fed the birds on our deck, as I normally do, I counted as many as 40 birds feasting, having just been displaced from the trees. I decided to feed them twice as much.

My mom, who lives a couple of blocks away, and my friends were all okay. We were among the more than 150,000 homes and businesses in the state without power. With nothing else to do, exhausted from the long night, I went back to sleep under my pile of blankets. This became a new pattern: sleeping more than 12 hours each night, just trying to stay warm, eating dinner at 3:30 or 4 before the sun set and the quiet of the town began. I stayed close to the house, while my husband volunteered overnight at the town warming center.

Our power returned after five and a half days, at 11:30 in the morning. That Thursday was the first day that the count of utility customers without power dropped below 100,000, but only barely. In my town, the Water Valley Electric Commission and its volunteer chairman, Brandon Presley, had worked hard to execute mutual-aid agreements with other municipally owned utilities and to engage private contractors and suppliers before the storm. That diligence paid off, and on Main Street, businesses were quickly up and running, providing us with resources and sustenance. The storm that we just lived through is the type that comes around every few decades, but dealing with dangerous ice here is starting to feel like a new routine. Not so long ago, another ice storm had trapped us atop our slippery hill. My neighbors are discussing their lists of winter needs for the future: ice cleats, hand warmers, a good pair of gloves, a snow shovel, a power bank, a camping stove.

Even if they are rare, storms like these teach us what we can tolerate. I lived in Memphis during the summer storm of 2003—a derecho that was affectionately called Hurricane Elvis. For 10 long days, I had no air-conditioning in 90-plus degrees, and I thought that was the worst I could feel, living in air so thick you’d think you could cut it with a knife. Winter Storm Fern changed my mind. Losing power in the cold, living in air so frigid I could see my breath inside my home, is much worse than the heat.

As of Friday, almost a week after the storm, tens of thousands of households still didn’t have power. Some families, in the more rural parts of an already rural state, have no idea how long the wait will be for their power to return. In my neighborhood, a warmer day melted some of the snow and ice away on the roads, but cold has set in again, and this weekend, temperatures dropped below freezing. I thought I might have a level of resilience to endure that kind of challenge, but I quickly learned that I really don’t.

The trees have their own kind of resilience, and they, too, will return—although that will take much longer than the power. Whereas pines grow relatively fast, oaks are slower. Thankfully, our 133-year-old oak tree was spared and will, I hope, continue to be a towering beacon, reminding us of the beauty of trees but also of the danger they can quickly create during storms. Especially when they’re covered in ice.

        <hr/>
        Masked men with guns are swarming through American cities. They are doing so in the name of enforcing immigration law. There is no justification, however, for federal agents to hide their identity from the public that pays for their weapons.

In an interview with CNN, Thom Tillis, the Republican senator from North Carolina, who has become an occasional Trump critic, said that he didn’t have a problem with federal agents wearing masks. “I’ve seen people dox me. I’ve seen people take pictures and identify law-enforcement officers and then put their families at risk,” Tillis said. Requiring agents to take off, or even pull down, their mask, he suggested, would endanger their safety—“I think that’s a step too far.”

Doxxing—which traditionally means the public exposure of an ordinary person’s identity and home address, and threats that harassment or even violence will follow that exposure—is a common technique in online bullying. Although exposing someone’s home address is clearly menacing, the concept of “doxxing” cannot apply to simply knowing the identity of public-facing government employees, especially not those empowered to use force.

Tillis’s logic illustrates how distorted the American approach to law enforcement has become. Police officers are civilians; they are public servants, not above the public. It is part of the job of police—and, for that matter, politicians—to be identifiable, because of the profound authority bestowed upon them. The ability to use force is a weighty responsibility, requiring high standards of conduct, and it can and should be revoked when abused. It is not “doxxing” federal agents for the public to know who they are. We are supposed to know who they are, because that is how we hold them accountable. This is why police officers wear visible badge numbers and name tags. The responsibilities they are given are not compatible with anonymity.

Ordinary police officers do not wear masks except in extremely rare and specific circumstances. This is the case even though, statistically, regular police officers are at far greater risk than immigration agents. According to an analysis by Alex Nowrasteh at the Cato Institute based on data from last year, “law enforcement officers who don’t work at ICE or Border Patrol have a death rate 6.3 times higher than that of immigration enforcement officers.” In fact, the report found, immigration agents are at no greater risk than regular people: “The chance of an ICE or Border Patrol agent being murdered in the line of duty is about one in 94,549 per year, about 5.5 times less likely than a civilian being murdered.”

If there were law-enforcement agencies particularly ill-suited to anonymity, it would be Customs and Border Protection and the Border Patrol. From 2005 to 2024, nearly 5,000 CBP and Border Patrol officers were arrested, according to the journalist Garrett Graff, who testified about his findings to an accountability commission set up by the governor of Illinois. Information on the multitude of corruption-related charges faced by agents can be found on the CBP’s own website. “The crime rate of CBP agents and offices was higher PER CAPITA than the crime rate of undocumented immigrants in the United States,” Graff writes.” Statistically speaking, “worst of the worst” seems to describe CBP and the Border Patrol as law-enforcement agencies better than it does the people they’re rounding up.

ICE does not have the same history of criminal behavior, but it does share a long record of abusing its powers and mistreating people in its custody. Put succinctly, these agencies deal with people the American system has frequently treated as barely human. Now these agents have been unleashed on Americans. Putting masks on people in agencies with internal cultures like these was always a recipe for catastrophe. The Trump administration took the most corrupt, poorly trained, and impulsive law-enforcement agencies in the country, gave them masks, and turned them against American cities.

Politicians, likewise, do not cover their face, though death threats—which should have no place in public discourse—have become far more common. It would nonetheless be absurd to conceal lawmakers’ identity, because then people would not know whom to hold responsible for public policy. Lawmakers do not vote by secret ballot, because they would be able to ignore popular preferences without fearing any consequences. That applies as much to police as it does to politicians. The public has a right to know the identity of the people who wield power in their name, so that they can withdraw that power from those who abuse or misuse it. If people can wield power over life and death without showing their face, we have a gang of criminals—not a police force.

The unhinged behavior that we have seen from federal immigration officials, including the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, who were shot while drawing attention to or recording agents’ behavior, is a direct consequence of power without accountability. On Sunday, ProPublica revealed the names of the two agents involved in the Pretti shooting: Border Patrol officer Jesus Ochoa and Customs and Border Protection officer Raymundo Gutierrez. Suffice it to say that two Hispanic Americans killing a white person trying to prevent them from harassing or deporting other Hispanic people, on the orders of Stephen Miller—a Jewish American whose ancestors fled pogroms in Eastern Europe—is a uniquely grotesque expression of the American melting pot in action.

Although the Department of Justice reversed course on Friday and promised an actual investigation of Pretti’s killing, President Trump has already eliminated traditional restraints on political control over criminal prosecutions and investigations, and Trump officials have already declared Pretti to be a terrorist and his killers to be innocent. Other Trump officials have loudly announced that federal agents have “absolute immunity” in the execution of their duties. Legal immunity plus anonymity equals impunity. It would be logical to think that in that situation, agents could literally get away with murder.

But the consequences of masked immigration agents’ extreme behavior go beyond those two fatal shootings. Thousands of students in the Twin Cities have stopped going to school and are in hiding with their families. The great majority of Somali and Hispanic residents of the Twin Cities area have legal status, but that seems to make no difference: Federal agents are indiscriminately stopping, detaining, and arresting people on the basis of little more than their accent or skin color, in violation of their due-process rights, a lawsuit from the ACLU contends. In Salem, Oregon, an American was hospitalized after reportedly being dragged from her car by immigration agents demanding her papers; she is among the dozens of Americans who, ProPublica reported in October, have been physically abused or detained for extended periods by immigration agents. The real number was probably greater then; it is certainly greater now.

Even regular cops are not immune to being profiled by ICE and the Border Patrol. “We’ve had many instances of people being stopped, family members of police officers being stopped that are American citizens,“ Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told The New York Times. “They’re not stopping family members of folks who are Norwegian or Irish. That’s not happening.” Twin Cities residents being racially profiled by federal agents can thank Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who blew a giant hole in the Fourteenth Amendment in a shadow-docket case in September. A later attempt by Kavanaugh to walk back his disastrous concurrence hasn’t altered federal agents’ conduct.

        <hr/>
        President Donald Trump is sharing details about the upcoming renovations at the newly-named "The Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts."

In a post shared to Truth Social on Friday, Dec. 26, the president, 79, featured photos of several white pieces of marble, which he said were being considered for armrests for seating at the performing arts institution in Washington, D.C.

"Potential Marble armrests for the seating at The Trump Kennedy Center," Trump wrote alongside the photos. "Unlike anything ever done or seen before!"

Shortly after taking office, Trump seized control of the Kennedy Center by purging the appointed members of the board and installing his own appointees. The Trump-friendly board then established Trump as chairman of the arts organization, which was dedicated in 1964 as a "living memorial" to assassinated President John F. Kennedy.

“I want to make sure it runs properly,” Trump said at the time. “We don’t need woke at the Kennedy Center, and we don’t need — some of the shows were terrible. They were a disgrace that they were even put on.”

The president’s name was added to signage on the Kennedy Center’s exterior on Dec. 19. Photos from outside the building showed work crews adding "The Donald Trump and" above the previously existing lettering, which read, "The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts."

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on the previous day that the board of the historic venue had "voted unanimously" to rename the building to the "Trump-Kennedy Center."

The Kennedy Center was established by an act of Congress, and Trump's critics have argued in recent days that only Congress is authorized to formally change its name.

Even so, the Kennedy Center almost immediately updated its logo on the website and social media to read "The Trump Kennedy Center," and the next day, Trump's name was added to the signage on the building's exterior.

In her Dec. 18 statement about the newly named "Trump Kennedy Center," Leavitt claimed that the institution's MAGA-aligned board "voted unanimously" to rename the center. However, Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty, an ex officio member of the Kennedy Center board who has an automatic vote because of her position in Congress, alleged she was silenced while trying to oppose the change.

"Be clear: I was on that call, and as I tried to push my button to voice my concern, to ask questions and certainly not to vote in support of this, I was muted," Beatty said in a video shared via X on Dec. 18. "Participants were not allowed to voice their concerns who were online, yet it was said at the end it was a unanimous vote."

Prominent members of JFK's family — including grandson Jack Schlossberg, grandnephew Joe Kennedy III, and nieces Maria Shriver and Kerry Kennedy — have spoken out against the unusual effort to put Trump's name on another president's memorial.

        <hr/>
        At some point over the past 15 years, kids stopped reading. Or at least their teachers stopped asking them to read the way they once did. We live in the age of the reel, the story, the sample, the clip. The age of the excerpt. And even in old-fashioned literature classes, assignments have been abbreviated so dramatically that high-school English teachers are, according to one recent survey, assigning fewer than three books a year.

I’ve seen the effects of this change up close, having taught English in college classrooms since 2007, and I’ve witnessed the slow erosion of attention firsthand, too: students on computers in the back of lecture halls, then on phones throughout the classroom, then outsourcing their education to artificial intelligence. We know that tech companies supply the means of distraction. But somehow the blame falls on the young reader. Whole novels aren’t possible to teach, we are told, because students won’t (or can’t) read them. So why assign them?

When I walked into my American-literature class at Case Western Reserve University last fall, I looked at 32 college students, mostly science majors, and expected an uphill battle. As my colleague Rose Horowitch has reported, “Many students no longer arrive at college—even at highly selective, elite colleges—prepared to read books.” One-third of the high-school seniors tested in 2024 were found not to have basic reading skills.

Yet by the end of the semester, as we read the last sentence of Toni Morrison’s Song of Solomon, I regretted ever doubting my students. I am now convinced that I was wrong to listen to the ostensible wisdom of the day—and that teachers of literature are wrong to give up assigning the books we loved ourselves. There may be plenty of good reasons to despair over the present. The literature classroom should not be one of them.

The image of a college literature class hasn’t changed much in the past 50 years. A group of students are sitting around a table, or maybe they’re perched in a lecture hall, looking down at a passage by Melville, reading a sentence out loud, puzzling over a metaphor, feeling the jolt of possibility that comes when their world is reimagined in startling language. My most vivid memory of reading an entire novel in college was picking up Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse. On an unseasonably warm spring night in 2002, I propped myself against the steps of the library, opened the book, and stayed there until the early morning.

I’ve taught for nearly two decades, but last fall I was worried in a way I’d never been before. I’ve always assigned long, challenging books. I regularly teach To the Lighthouse to first-year students, sometimes swapping it out for James Joyce’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man or Mulk Raj Anand’s Untouchable. But anecdotes and statistics about the decline of reading unsettled me. Plus, I was worried about my own raddled attention span, and I was unnerved by the apparent inevitability of AI-generated essays.

My course, a survey of American literature from 1660 to the present, felt like a dare: 400 years of literature in a single semester. And yet my fears that students might refuse to read helped clarify my approach. Instead of hopscotching from one excerpt to the next, I’d create small eddies in time. We’d spend several days, sometimes a couple of weeks, on a single author. We’d read nonfiction and novels—Harriet Jacobs’s Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying, Willa Cather’s My Ántonia—and long poems. I couldn’t be comprehensive; the course’s remit was, essentially, Puritans to the present. I was, instead, serious about reading whole books (and sermons: It’s impossible not to include Jonathan Edwards’s “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” if you’re seeking to understand early American literature). I would teach the students what I was starting to miss myself: tarrying with an author beyond his best-known works, developing a relationship with a novelist across wildly different novels.

Two things became clear in the early weeks of class. First, the students were reading. They were reading everything, or most of it. I know this because I had them identify obscure passages, without notes, devices, or books at hand. Second, they were experiencing life in a way that was not easy outside the class and its assignments. They were expected—required—to give huge chunks of time to an activity, reading, that was not monetizing their attention in real time. They had, in effect, taken back their lives, for an hour or two each day. It turned out that American literature, which so often flirts with utopian fantasies of regaining control—hello, Walden!—could do precisely that.

To give the students time to read, I had to change the way they wrote. I axed the take-home essays I’d assigned before—this wasn’t a “writing” class, anyway—and assigned what I suspected were far more difficult in-class, timed “flash essays,” with prompts I gave the same day. No trudging back from the library with 10 pages on Woolf in the special season of Cleveland weather we call “stupid cold.” Long, research-based essay assignments had always worked well for the top students in the class, the ones who were already trained to write. But I’ve rarely seen, over the course of my career, the kind of development I hoped for in the majority of students whom I asked to write that way.

I was also thinking of the writing I myself had been doing lately, smooshed within the hour I had for lunch, or pounded out on the couch after toddler bedtime. I wanted my students to have a taste of the adrenaline and, yes, stress that came from writing when faced with real time constraints. I wanted edge-of-the-seat writing that opened itself up to failure. They would confront their fear without guardrails, without bumpers, without AI-drafted support, without a plan or even a thesis. One student came up to me after the first flash essay, a little frustrated and worried that he wasn’t meeting the mark. He felt like he was writing into the complete unknown, rather than with a plan in mind. I said that was exactly the point.

In a haunting sentence from Austerlitz, by the German novelist W. G. Sebald, the titular character describes losing control of his language. Once a fluent and successful writer, Austerlitz suddenly falls into a crisis of faith about the sentence, which becomes “at best a makeshift expedient, a kind of unhealthy growth issuing from our ignorance, something which we use, in the same way as many sea plants and animals use their tentacles, to grope blindly through the darkness enveloping us.” I liked the metaphor of writing into the darkness. So I devised simple essay topics that asked students to write about their own difficulties as readers. One was: “Write about a moment in an Emily Dickinson poem that you don’t understand.” Another was: “Write about your morning routine, but in the style of Faulkner.” I didn’t want to create 32 new Faulkners. I wanted the students to experience the moment when their own style broke through the imitation, when the attempt to write like Faulkner failed and revealed, as a kind of photonegative, their own emergent voices. John Keats called this state of being “negative capability,” a condition in which the writer leans to live in a perpetual state of uncertainty. If it was really true that the students couldn’t read, then it was up to me to put the books in their way and make them deal with them.

Adults underestimate the power of simply telling a young person to read a book and vouching for it ourselves. A teacher gave me Leo Tolstoy and Victor Hugo when I was far too young. I loved to read already, but at that age (13), my diet had been Star Trek novelizations, Michael Crichton, and—thanks to a dull sick day browsing my parents’ shelves—The Bonfire of the Vanities. In early high school, I read War and Peace and Les Misèrables and was absolutely mystified by the density of detail. I was frequently bored—all those pages on the sewer system of Paris—and then suddenly moved to tears by a character like Eponine, who “smiled a little, and died” in the arms of Marius. I was just too immature for other novels: Emma Bovary’s desire and Charles Swann’s jealousy mystified me, because I would not ask anyone out for at least another five years. Inundating myself with thousand-page novels set in the early 19th century, I had nearly every experience one has while reading, and I had them all at once. I came as close to overdosing on Russian mood swings as I could. But by the time I reached the end of high school, I developed a tolerance for what I did not understand, and then I gradually understood it. Once I did begin to understand, I felt an extraordinary desire to repeat the experience. Reading this much made books feel like a “doorway” for me, as George Saunders has called it.

I saw something like this happen in my American-literature class. First impressions, in literature as in life, are unreliable. When we started Walden, plenty of students were turned off by Thoreau’s long-winded musings on the real-estate market in New England. Two classes later, Thoreau was a friend for life. His timeless needling felt timely: “We know not where we are. Beside, we are sound asleep half our life.” Despite his flight to the woods, Thoreau was more easily distracted than any of us—by birdsong, by a train whistle, by the sound of ice cracking. He could barely sustain a single thought without jumping to an unrelated idea. Walden is a book that freely indulges in distraction—not to dull our senses, but to keep ourselves awake, curious, delighted, enraged. Thoreau’s world sends us constant notifications, and by doing so, asks us to reject the “vain reality” where we have been “shipwrecked.”

The iterative process of confusion, endurance, and incremental understanding is what literature professors teach when they assign whole books. This march toward understanding doesn’t have a great name other than reading. We need to help students grow into the difficulty of reading. The best way to do that is not to “meet them where they are,” a bromide that has become doctrine for higher education. We have to do as Whitman says instead: Stop somewhere ahead and wait for them to catch up.

None of this is to say that higher education faces no challenges in this moment. Universities’ resources are severely constrained; their research missions have been hobbled. In many institutions, academic freedom has been threatened or abrogated. These are bleak conditions, possibly terminal ones for the post–World War II dream of a research university. I agree with those who argue that universities find themselves in a state of crisis. But narratives about the “end of reading” strike me as self-inflicted, the manifestation of a collective depression. (In other words, to borrow from Thoreau, “We know not where we are.”) If we want students to keep reading books, faculty have the most important role to play—regardless of whatever new devices or platforms emerge to capture students’ attention. The reaction to declining reading skills, poor comprehension, and fragmented attention spans should not be to negotiate or compromise, but to double down on the cure.

Defenses of the humanities largely get things right. Books teach you empathy because you imagine other lives. Poems refresh our conventional words—what Wallace Stevens derided as the “rotted names”—by investing language with power and nuance. I’m partial to the way the poet Adrienne Rich put it while teaching in the tuition-free City College of New York system: “What interests me in teaching is less the emergence of the occasional genius than the overall finding of language by those who did not have it and by those who have been used and abused to the extent that they lacked it.” Literature helps you express your own thoughts in vivid language, partly by imitating the writers who do it well. If you’re not inclined toward the ethical view, or Rich’s vision of social transformation, books might provide escape routes instead, invitations to leisure or to what my colleague Adam Kirsch has called “vice.”

But the whole notion of having to defend literature or the humanities in the first place may have us wrong-footed. It’s not only what you learn from reading Moby-Dick—notwithstanding Melville’s extensive knowledge of 19th-century whaling—but what you are doing when you are reading Moby-Dick. You are neither learning a transferable skill nor escaping from the world’s demands that you do. You are not word-maxxing or optimizing information for efficiency. You are engaged in a singular practice, one with its own primary justification.

The students I taught last semester turned enthusiastically to Faulkner and spent their time reading about the journey of the Bundren family to bury their mother’s body. Why did they do this? Because I asked them to, and told them it was worth it. I said that time was precious, and that we needed to take some of it back for ourselves. So we did.

When President Donald Trump visited George Washington’s Mount Vernon in 2018, he reportedly showed little interest in the estate or in the first president. But Trump did have a critique of his predecessor. “If he was smart, he would’ve put his name on it,” he reportedly said. “You’ve got to put your name on stuff, or no one remembers you.”

The advice might seem “truly bizarre,” as Mount Vernon’s CEO described the visit to others, but Trump practices what he preaches. Yesterday, the Trump White House announced that the board of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts—which is chaired by Donald J. Trump, who was appointed to that role by Donald J. Trump, who also filled the board with fellow Trump appointees—would rename the venue the Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. This was, the Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt opined, a tribute to “the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year” at the center, “not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction but also financially, and its reputation.”

This is a challenging claim from a factual standpoint. As The Washington Post found, ticket sales at the Kennedy Center have tanked since Trump’s hostile takeover of the institution in February. Patrons booed Trump and Vice President J. D. Vance at concerts this year. Events there have taken on an uncanny sheen of decay and mediocrity, my colleague Alexandra Petri reported after attending the Kennedy Center Honors last week.

The announcement is also challenging from a statutory perspective. The Kennedy Center’s name was bestowed by a law passed by Congress and can’t be changed by the board on its own. Tim Shriver, John F. Kennedy’s nephew, wrote on X, “Would they rename the Lincoln memorial? The Jefferson?”

Who’s to stop Trump, though? Workers began changing the signage this morning, and Congress seems unlikely to act; anyway, even if the name isn’t formally changed, nothing will prevent the president from calling it what he wants. Consider the Department of Defense, which the administration insists on calling the Department of War, despite the former name being established by law. Or more apropos, take the U.S. Institute of Peace, which was also established and named by Congress but which recently got a (rather premature) rebrand, with the facade now reading Donald J. Trump United States Institute of Peace. The gesture here is blunt. The president placing his own name before the nation’s is redolent of dictators in isolated countries—North Korea’s Kim family and Turkmenistan’s Saparmurat Niyazov, who even renamed January after himself—and long-ago absolute monarchs such as Louis XIV, who is said to have declared, “L’état, c’est moi.”

In line with his view of himself not merely as an elected representative but as father of the nation (or perhaps “daddy” of the nation?), Trump has put his name and image in places large and small. His scowling visage is next to George Washington’s portrait on National Parks passes; for good measure, citizens can now enter parks for free on Trump’s birthday, which happens to be Flag Day, but no longer on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. A new pay-for-play visa for the very rich is called the Trump Gold Card. The Treasury has proposed 250th-anniversary $1 coins with Trump’s face on them, a serious deviation from precedent. (The law bars printing money with images of living people on it but does not apply to minting coins.) Does anyone have any doubt what name he’ll put on his boondoggle ballroom at the White House?

This tendency is not new. Throughout his career, Trump has plastered his name on whatever he can, including many buildings, a hideous pair of sneakers, a bottle-water brand, a short-lived airline, a short-lived magazine, and a short-lived steak line. (At a 2016 primary-victory party, Trump displayed steaks bought at a local butcher but claimed that they were Trump Steaks.) The apotheosis came late in his real-estate career, when Trump had mostly stopped developing properties but continued to license his name to other builders. (Some Trump-branded buildings have removed his name in recent years, as his scandals and growing unpopularity have made it a liability.)

The difference is that those things belonged to Trump. The assets of the United States of America do not—they belong to the people. His change to the facade of the U.S. Institute of Peace is just graffiti. Putting his name on the Kennedy Center and parks passes are acts of vandalism of public property, in the most original sense of the word.

Many things in this country are named for former presidents, of course. The performing-arts center was established not by John F. Kennedy but as a memorial to him after his assassination. Trump, by contrast, is rechristening things for himself and then pretending it’s an honor rather than an ego trip. He asks not what he can do for his country, but what his country can name for him.

The Color of the Year Is an Exercise in Absurdity

By Ellen Cushing

Earlier this month, many attractive people filled a room in Lower Manhattan. They drank elaborate cocktails and gazed upon Instagram-y art installations and left with a gift bag that contained, among other things, earbuds studded with Swarovski crystals. The vibe was high-end, sophisticated, arty. The guest of honor was a color.

Pantone throws a party like this one annually, in conjunction with the announcement of its “Color of the Year.” For 2026, it’s “Cloud Dancer,” which, the company notes in a press release, “serves as a symbol of calming influence in a frenetic society rediscovering the value of measured consideration and quiet reflection.” The color, the release continues, also helps peel “away layers of outmoded thinking,” “making room for innovation,” and, of course, reminds us that “true strength lies not just in doing, but also in being.” (It’s white.)

For many years, I kept a bottle of Trump Ice water on my desk. My first job in journalism after graduation was interning on the real-estate desk at The Wall Street Journal, where I talked with Trump for the first time. (He engaged in some fairly transparent puffery.) A veteran reporter, preparing to ship out to another assignment, jokingly gave me the bottle as a memento. I eventually got rid of it when I realized that it appeared to be leaching water even though the lid was sealed. Perhaps that was foreshadowing of the Trump administration’s approach to clean water.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> House Republican leaders are working to pass a funding bill to end a partial government shutdown amidst a razor-thin majority and opposition from House Democrats. The conflict centers on Department of Homeland Security funding and immigration enforcement accountability, with Speaker Mike Johnson aiming for a party-line vote supported by President Donald Trump to reopen agencies by Tuesday.

        <hr/>
        House Republican leaders are seeking enough votes in the narrowly divided chamber to reopen the federal government, which has been partially shut since early Saturday morning after funding lapsed.

It won’t be simple: Many House Democrats do not plan to support the deal Senate Democrats struck with the White House. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) told House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) last week that his party would not help pass the package without numerous additional restrictions on immigration enforcement, according to two senior House Democratic aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations.

If most Democrats do not support the package, Republicans will need near-unanimity to pass the funding package, which President Donald Trump has endorsed. But Johnson predicted on NBC News’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that they would be able to end the shutdown “at least by Tuesday.”

“We have a logistical challenge of getting everyone in town, and because of the conversation I had with Hakeem Jeffries, I know that we’ve got to pass a rule and probably do this mostly on our own,” Johnson said, referencing a floor vote that is traditionally passed on party lines.

A procedural vote Monday set for a key committee stacked with several ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus members will provide an early test of whether the GOP can muscle the measure through on its own.

In a post on social media Monday, Trump urged lawmakers to support the deal and discouraged members who are seeking to attach additional conservative policy to the legislation.

“There can be NO CHANGES at this time,” he wrote. “We will work together in good faith to address the issues that have been raised, but we cannot have another long, pointless, and destructive Shutdown that will hurt our Country so badly — One that will not benefit Republicans or Democrats. I hope everyone will vote, YES!”

Last month, Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Appropriations committees negotiated a sweeping package that would have funded most of the federal government through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.

Many Democrats had already said they were uncomfortable supporting one part of that plan: $64.4 billion in funding for the Department of Homeland Security, including $10 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Trump administration’s immigration raids in Minneapolis drew national attention after an ICE agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renée Good last month, prompting mass demonstrations in the Twin Cities, and another ICE officer shot an undocumented Venezuelan man, Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, in the leg during an arrest.

The House passed the initial funding package, primarily along party lines. But two days later, immigration agents shot and killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Senate Democrats returned to Washington demanding that Republicans separate DHS funding from the rest of the bill until the parties could agree on new accountability measures for immigration agents, including implementing a code of conduct and requiring that agents wear body cameras and identification.

The White House struck a deal with Senate Democrats to extend DHS funding for two weeks to buy time for negotiations while passing the remaining funding, which include appropriations for the Pentagon, the Health and Human Services Department and more. The DHS bill also covers the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection.

That agreement passed the Senate on Friday evening. But because the changes had not been approved by the House, the unfunded agencies shuttered early Saturday morning.

House Republicans will have one vote to spare if every Democrat votes against the plan. Some House Democrats are considering supporting the package, but others have privately raised concerns that Senate negotiators won’t be able to achieve meaningful accountability measures — and some have said they would prefer if ICE is not funded this year, noting that the agency received $75 billion from last year’s Republican tax and spending law. (ICE would also be able to continue operating if it isn’t funded, drawing on that money.)

“We’re going to have to evaluate what the real opportunity is to get dramatic change at the Department of Homeland Security. It needs to be bold, it needs to be meaningful, and it needs to be transformative,” Jeffries told reporters on Friday. “Absent a path toward accomplishing dramatic change, and making sure that ICE and DHS are conducting themselves like every other law enforcement agency in the country, then Republicans are going to cause another government shutdown.”

Republicans will face their first hurdle Monday afternoon, when a House committee responsible for setting legislative rules — and with a unique power to make it much harder for bills to pass on the floor — will meet to consider the measure.

That panel, the House Rules Committee, is stacked with conservative hard-liners who have raised concerns with the bipartisan agreement. But Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who is among those hard-liners, told Fox News on Saturday that he thinks they will advance the measure because “we don’t want to let our men and women in uniform get held hostage.”

Once the government is funded, he added, Republicans will push hard to ensure the DHS bill isn’t held in limbo after the two-week funding extension.

“ICE is law enforcement. They have a constitutional and legal duty to protect the American people. They’ve been doing that,” Roy said. “So we’re going to stand up for them.”

Rep. Ralph Norman (R-South Carolina), another one of the committee’s conservatives, said he will support the 10-day extension.

“I’ll reluctantly vote for the rule and give them the stupid 10 days, and let’s see how it plays out,” he said. “It’s going to get shut down, let [the Democrats] bear the consequences.”

Another House Republican, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (Florida), is demanding that the House attach a bill to the funding package that would require proof of citizenship during voter registration — which would send the measure back to the Senate again, further extending the shutdown.

“This is my price for a ‘yes’ vote,” Luna wrote Sunday afternoon on X.

Roy, the lead sponsor on the House’s Save America Act that Luna supports, indicated that he may be more flexible.

“We’re working with the White House and the speaker on the best processes,” he told Fox. “We’re trying to be responsible, do our job and follow the bipartisan agreement.”

Even before Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had declared Alex Pretti a domestic terrorist, Pete Hegseth was online trashing his home state. Hegseth, who grew up north of Minneapolis, took to social media in the hours after masked immigration agents shot the ICU nurse with a stark calculation: “ICE > MN.”

“We have your back 100%. You are SAVING the country,” the Pentagon chief told immigration agents in an X post. “Shame on the leadership of Minnesota—and the lunatics in the street.” Hegseth didn’t define the we. He and fellow Cabinet members? The 1.3 million service members he commands? The troops he put on standby for potential deployment to Minneapolis? He hasn’t said. But if there was any doubt about how Hegseth would wield military might if troops were sent to check unrest or dissent in U.S. cities, there’s your answer.

Hegseth, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan as a National Guardsman before becoming a Fox News weekend host, has repeatedly blamed “woke” and “weak” military leaders for imposing overly restrictive rules of engagement that, he believes, cost U.S. lives and prolonged America’s “forever” wars. Since taking office, Hegseth has been an ardent supporter of Donald Trump’s expanded use of troops in U.S. cities and his aggressive immigration operations. When federal immigration agents surged into Minneapolis, Hegseth put troops on prepare-to-deploy orders in North Carolina and Alaska. Trump has also threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would allow troops to conduct law-enforcement activities.

In standing with ICE’s hard-line tactics against the citizens of Minnesota, Hegseth not only overstepped his jurisdiction as secretary of defense (he prefers to be called the “secretary of war”); he gave a glimpse of the belligerent approach he might take were those troops to be opposed by citizen protesters such as Pretti and Renee Good. It is one thing to defend your troops as they face enemies abroad. It is quite another to suggest that troops—or other armed government forces—have a free hand to do whatever they want on America’s streets to American citizens.

Asked about Hegseth’s comments, Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson said in an emailed statement that the secretary’s mission was to execute Trump’s orders and protect the United States: “We will do everything in our power to stop those who seek to harm Americans and the brave men and women defending our homeland.”

I’ve covered every secretary of defense since Bob Gates, who served George W. Bush and Barack Obama. No Pentagon chief then or since has embraced the jocular yet intimidating rhetoric that Hegseth has employed about the military’s use of violence. At times, uniformed leaders have spouted off in public. Jim Mattis, the retired Marine general whom Trump referred to as “Mad Dog,” made tough-guy quips about how “it’s fun to shoot some people” and the need to “have a plan to kill everyone you meet.” But Mattis turned out to be a check on—rather than an accelerant of—Trump’s most disruptive instincts. Pentagon leaders have almost always publicly couched the military’s use of violence in decorous euphemisms designed to show the solemnity of lethality. Insurgents are “eliminated” or “taken off the battlefield.” Public gloating, in an institution as storied and upright as the U.S. military, is viewed as unseemly.

Not so for Hegseth. His tone and vocabulary regarding the use of force are gleeful, juvenile, and crude. He has posted doctored children’s-book covers that show a turtle named Franklin hanging out of a helicopter, shooting at drug boats. He embraced a phrase that the White House is now touting as Trump’s doctrine for the use of force: fuck around and find out. And he has celebrated lethal strikes on suspected drug traffickers in small boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. After the initial strike in September, he told reporters, “I’d say we smoked a drug boat and there’s 11 narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean—and when other people try to do that, they’re gonna meet the same fate.” In November, hours after The Washington Post reported that commanders had killed two survivors of that strike, Hegseth posted, “We have only just begun to kill narco-terrorists.” Hegseth has denied any wrongdoing by the military and has not announced any internal investigations or reviews.

Trump’s adviser Stephen Miller and the president himself employ similar cruelty when discussing what they see as America’s urban pathologies (Trump has described an “invasion from within” and said U.S. cities should be used as “training grounds” for the military). But it’s unusual, to say the least, for someone who sits in the top office at the Pentagon, a department focused on conflict outside the U.S. In theory, Hegseth is supposed to be setting an example for the world’s most powerful military, responsible for a large nuclear arsenal and the life-and-death decisions of a massive global force.

Hegseth’s regular demonization of domestic opponents (the “lunatics” he referred to are the same American citizens the military is duty bound to protect) also gives a glimpse into how he would view the power dynamic were troops to be deployed domestically. (In contrast to Hegseth’s swagger, when Minnesota state leaders deployed the National Guard to assist local law enforcement this week, Guardsmen handed out coffee and doughnuts.)

Peter Feaver, an expert on civil-military relations at Duke University, told me that the top Pentagon officials responsible for the nation’s sons and daughters in service, and the weighty matters of war and peace, generally have tried to stay out of public political squabbles as much as possible. Hegseth, instead, “has adopted a messaging posture that breaks with that tradition, perhaps reflecting his own background as a partisan commentator on Fox News and thus his comfort with the hot takes and rapid-response mentality of that medium,” Feaver said. “Having the secretary be so prominent in partisan sparring can put pressure on the nonpartisan military, whose professional ethic requires them to stay out of the fray.”

Staying out of the fray is exactly what U.S. troops—the National Guard and a small contingent of active-duty Marines—have done over the past year as the president and his allies deployed them to assist federal agents, fight crime, or respond to unrest in cities including Los Angeles, Memphis, and the nation’s capital. Military experts say that’s because military personnel have more extensive training and better discipline than ICE or Border Patrol agents.

But Hegseth’s firing of the top Army, Navy, and Air Force lawyers suggests a different potential problem in any further domestic deployments, Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me. Hegseth, who, before taking office, advocated for the lenient treatment of troops convicted of war crimes, might simply override the military-justice system if any violence occurs. “There’s always somebody who acts inappropriately, even criminally, in a moment of stress or frustration and needs to be held accountable,” Cancian said. “That will be a test.”

Hegseth’s attitude is rooted in his disillusionment and disappointment over his experience in Iraq, people who know him say. In his 2024 book, The War on Warriors, Hegseth boasted about instructing members of the platoon he led to disregard their rules of engagement, a shocking admission and one that now looks especially ominous should the Trump administration deploy troops in new ways within the United States.

Hegseth described his time in the 101st Airborne’s 3rd Brigade Combat Team—the camaraderie, stress, and euphoria of combat—as transformational. He emulated then-Colonel Michael Steele, a Black Hawk Down veteran and brigade commander who he felt was wrongly held responsible for attacks on civilians that occurred under his watch, one of the people who know Hegseth told me.

Those rules of engagement are handed down from commanders who are advised by military lawyers, called judge advocates general. Their aim is to ensure that operations comply with U.S and international law.

Hegseth has dismissed JAGs as “jagoffs” and complained that their decisions led to U.S. troops “fighting with one hand behind our back” in Iraq and Afghanistan. “When you send Americans to war, their mandate should be to lethally dominate the battlefield,” he wrote. “Our enemies should get bullets, not attorneys.”

Hegseth’s approach at the Pentagon has reflected those convictions. Since taking over a year ago, Hegseth has fired top generals and flag officers and vowed to empower the trigger-pullers. Speaking to senior uniformed leaders he summoned to a Marine base in Virginia last fall, Hegseth said the military would fight wars to win, not to defend, and would end “stupid” restrictions on the use of force. “We untie the hands of our warfighters to intimidate, demoralize, hunt, and kill the enemies of our country,” he told hundreds of officers. “No more politically correct and overbearing rules of engagement; just common sense, maximum lethality, and authority for warfighters.”

Hegseth has company among some other veterans of the post-9/11 wars in believing that restrictive rules of engagement led to the U.S. failures in Iraq and Afghanistan, because troops were prevented from killing more insurgents, Jason Dempsey, a former Army officer who served two years in Afghanistan, told me. Dempsey described Hegseth’s attitude this way: “There should be no standards on the battlefield because it’s all us versus them, black versus white, good versus evil, and there are no innocent or undecided people in between.”

The importance of projecting strength and toughness is a deeply held belief for Hegseth, one of the people who know him told me. At the same time, Hegseth takes his cues from Trump, whose support is key to him keeping his role. In recent days, the president has distanced himself from his subordinates’ hot-blooded response to Pretti’s death, and his “border czar” has promised to wind down the federal immigration surge in Minnesota. In this case, Hegseth may be out of step with what his boss now wants.

        <hr/>
        I’m nerves on nerves, fizzy, breathing through preshow jitters. A voice crackles in the speakers backstage at the Kennedy Center: “Five minutes to showtime.”

Though my band, Guster, has more than 2,000 performances behind us, this one is a real humdinger. Tonight we will be accompanied by the 60-member National Symphony Orchestra, which, on its own, is emotional and exhilarating; very few moments compare to fronting a world-class orchestra and, together, playing songs that are a part of you. There’s also the venue itself, the historic Kennedy Center, which has served as a national cultural hub for more than half a century. But momentous events from beyond the stage hovered, too: In February, well after all 5,000 tickets had been sold for our two-night stand, Donald Trump dismissed multiple members of the Kennedy Center board and installed himself as the institution’s chairman. The president, who said he wants programming to be less “wokey,” gleefully promised a “Golden Age in Arts and Culture” under his leadership.

In the weeks that followed, everything was chaos. Long-serving staff resigned, artists canceled their appearances in protest—including the actor Issa Rae and the rock band Low Cut Connie—and every ticket buyer had a new question to answer, a fresh moral quandary. Our band, too, found ourselves on a prickly path to one of the most revered venues in the country. We asked ourselves: What was the best way to use our voices in defiance of an administration that doesn’t share our values? How could we support our fans, who have sustained us for decades, and many of whom were now deeply conflicted about being in a building that was at the center of a culture war?

It was a mess. Immediately after Trump’s announcement, direct messages from fans began to stream in, and comment sections on our Facebook and Instagram pages swelled. Some had practical questions (were we going to cancel the performances?) while others discussed the ethics of simply attending a show at Kennedy Center in light of its freshly altered mission. Three factions coalesced: those who thought we should cancel in solidarity with other protesting artists; those saying we should save our protest for the stage; and a small but vocal “shut up and dribble” contingent proclaiming that a new administration was a non-event. Not everything has to be about politics, the latter noted.

Thankfully, the four of us in the band are mostly aligned politically, which is a gift when our individual personalities are often reduced to a single, public entity. We immediately huddled and, though we all had our individual opinions, agreed that our voice as a band would be loudest from the Kennedy Center stage. That space was given to us by the venue’s previous curators, and we were united in our desire to own it. We wanted to support the staff at the Kennedy Center who were caught in this political crossfire; the fans who had bought tickets, flights, and hotel rooms; and the musicians we would be performing with. Our challenge, beyond putting on an indelible show, was to find a way to make our dissension clear, with dignity and creativity. No one in the band was interested in hosting a rally on F Street, but neither could we just shut up and dribble this time. We had been given a microphone and we intended to use it.

Getting this messaging right was crucial for Guster. Touring bands that play three-and-a-half-minute pop songs don’t find themselves in their fourth decade without an incredibly strong connection to their fans. We have never had a hit song on pop radio or been fawned over by the music press. The major engine in our career—and the reason it continues to thrive—is the relationship of our four personalities with the people who listen to our music. Certainly for some, we’re the guys who played their college campus in the ’90s or sang that “Satellite” song. But many of our current fans have seen us dozens, if not hundreds, of times. They refer to other fans as their “Guster Fam” and organize meetups before shows. Our annual festival in Portland, Maine, brings 4,000 people into a community that rivals the depth of Phish fans and Deadheads. Fans have tattoos with Guster lyrics, they name their pets after characters in our songs, and use our music at weddings and funerals. As we move through artistic and personal milestones, we do so alongside many of them, our evolving albums a soundtrack for our fans’ evolving lives. It’s a position we hold with deep honor and gratitude.

Initially by circumstance and now by design, in the Guster universe, there is very little space between art and artist. The implication here is that many of our fans want to know that we have their backs, and we demonstrate these alliances on occasion. My bandmate Adam Gardner co-founded the environmental nonprofit Reverb, which aims to reduce concert and tour footprints. And we dipped a toe into wry activism when I wore a dress onstage in Ponte Vedra, Florida, coinciding with the state’s anti-drag law in 2023. But in an ever more polarized world, solidarity becomes a more difficult assignment. As algorithms and politics herd us into narrower and narrower silos, the pressure increases on artists (as well as comedians, actors, and even brands) to mirror their fans’ core beliefs. For some, every consumption choice is a reflection of their values. There is opportunity here, to strengthen the bond we already have with our fans; but there is also significant risk in alienating those with whom we may disagree. We must also be judicious and know when to speak and when to let the music speak on our behalf.

We had a test run straight into this volatility earlier this year. Following the presidential inauguration, we launched a three-week tour across the United States, including several shows in red states such as Iowa, Nebraska, and Utah. Initially, there was some unease: How would it feel to play these venues, which would almost certainly bring out audiences who were diverse in their politics? During that tour, just as now, America was raw and explosive, a powder keg. But these evenings proved transformative. Songs are time machines that, at their best, reduce and expose us. And this level of safely shared vulnerability, in a room of thousands, can verge on the spiritual. The knowledge that our fans could catch a glance of one another and think, Oh, we’re actually all in this together offered us some assurance that our performances, even if just for a moment, actually mattered.

As our Kennedy Center dates approached, the headlines stayed tumultuous. The juggernaut musical Hamilton announced that it was canceling its 2026 run at the venue. Others remained steadfast. Conan O’Brien received the Mark Twain Prize at the Kennedy Center and gave a moving speech that toed the line of defiance, humor, and poignance. “Twain hated bullies,” he said, “and he deeply, deeply empathized with the weak.” The comic W. Kamau Bell, who performed at the venue shortly after Trump announced his takeover, wrote about the experience, noting that it was his job to “speak truth to power.” And like Bell, my bandmates and I understood why other artists were continuing to cancel their performances. But he, O’Brien, and others demonstrated that there is more than one way to stand up for what you believe.

On Friday night, the first of the two shows, we played an incredibly moving set, flanked by the National Symphony Orchestra. The arrangements soared; the dynamics were rich and powerful. Lyrics that would normally slip through me on autopilot were now barbed and heavy. I choked up on our new song, “Maybe We’re Alright,” the words “the lies we tell ourselves just to fall asleep” landing like a gut punch. As the evening continued, I could sense something expectant in the room; our fans, many wearing rainbow attire, Pride pins, and T-shirts with anti-facist slogans, were waiting for a declaration of some kind.

Near the end of the show, we invited some surprise guests to the stage. “My friend Michael wrote the songs for a musical called Finn,” I said, reading from a statement. “In the before times, they were booked to play here, but as you all know, things happened, and the show is no longer being presented by the Kennedy Center.” The musical, whose planned tour had been canceled, told a story of self-discovery, as a young shark realizes that he may, in fact, be a fish; its creators have said it can be read as reflective of the queer experience. We, as a band, have always felt connected to our queer fans, and our bond has deepened in this moment when diversity is under attack. The world we want to live in needs all kinds of fish.

“As the new administration has made abundantly clear, Finn’s themes of inclusivity, love, and self-acceptance aren’t going to be welcome in this building while they are in control,” I continued. “So tonight our band is here to say ‘Our stage is your stage. We are your allies, we stand with the LGBTQ community, and we want you to sing with us.’ Please welcome the cast of Finn and composer Michael Kooman. They belong here.”

Michael and the five cast members of Finn joined us onstage to what I am certain will be among the loudest and longest ovations of our career. They accompanied us on our song “Hard Times”: “I’m breathing in / the oxygen / I’m holding it / through hard times.” There were tears onstage and off.

Tonight, our final night, we once again invite Michael and the Finn cast to sing—and, this time, to say a few words. He takes a deep breath, waits for silence, and addresses the audience with confidence and heart: Finn is “a show about growing up, feeling like you don’t fit in. It’s a show about finding your chosen family. And, most importantly, it’s a show about being yourself and standing up for what you believe in, even if it’s really scary. The message itself is more important now than whenever we began to write the show.”

As the last notes of our encore disappear into the theater, we collectively applaud the National Symphony Orchestra and our conductor, Enrico Lopez-Yañez. We turn toward the audience, huddle for a final bow, and look out at thousands of beaming faces. This is our chosen family, sharks and fishes—multicolored, vibrant, and most assuredly not welcome back to the Kennedy Center anytime soon.

        <hr/>
        One year ago, President Trump conducted a hostile takeover of the Kennedy Center, the venerable Washington, D.C., performing-arts institution. The president said he had never attended a show there, but he was confident that he alone knew what the center needed.

Last night, Trump delivered an implicit admission of defeat, announcing that the center will close on July 4 for two years. Trump brought the same theory to the Kennedy Center that he does to most of his moves: He believes that he knows better than the experts, and that a “silent majority” actually supports his disruptions. That certainty seems to have led him to a bad bet here.

“I have determined that The Trump Kennedy Center, if temporarily closed for Construction, Revitalization, and Complete Rebuilding, can be, without question, the finest Performing Arts Facility of its kind, anywhere in the World,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “The temporary closure will produce a much faster and higher quality result!”

If you’ve been paying attention, this explanation will be perplexing. In October, Trump posted that “Many major improvements” were under way at the center—including, bafflingly, the addition of marble armrests on chairs—but that “We are remaining fully open during construction, renovation, and beautification.” (For the record, the Kennedy Center underwent a $250 million expansion just seven years ago.)

In December, when Trump added his name to the building’s facade—in violation of statute and grammar—he boasted, “We saved the building. The building was in such bad shape, both physically, financially and every other way. And now it’s very solid, very strong.” Just a month ago he added, “A year ago it was in a state of financial and physical collapse. Wait until you see it a year from now!!! Like our Country, itself, it will rise from the ashes.”

Now Trump is saying that a year from now the center will be closed and dark. Trump’s contradictory statements and the absence of an independent board or any notification to Congress make these claims of a building in need of repair unverifiable at best, and most likely nonsense. (He also hasn’t said anything about how he would pay for this renovation.) A more plausible reason for the closing is that under Trump, the Kennedy Center can’t hold on to staff, artists, or audiences.

When Trump took over, he fired Deborah Rutter, the respected programmer who was the center’s president, and replaced her with Richard Grenell, a political bagman who had previously been deployed as acting director of national intelligence, ambassador to Germany, and envoy to Venezuela, but who had no arts experience. (To be fair, he had little or no qualifications for most of those jobs.) Other staff haven’t stuck around either. “Almost every head of programming has resigned or been dismissed,” The Washington Post notes.

The latest of these was Kevin Couch, the new head of programming, who quit less than two weeks after his hiring was announced. One can imagine the job would be no picnic. In recent weeks, the composer Philip Glass yanked a new symphony commissioned by the center. The opera singer Renée Fleming also canceled two performances. The Washington National Opera announced that it was departing the center. The jazz musician Chuck Redd canceled a long-running Christmas Eve concert. Grenell’s threat to sue Redd for $1 million is unlikely to make artists more eager to book shows.

Grenell has accused artists of politicizing the center. “The left is boycotting the Arts because Trump is supporting the Arts,” he posted on X. “The Arts are for everyone—and the Left is mad about it.” But this statement has it all backwards. Trump grabbed unprecedented presidential control and politicized his own involvement in the arts, promising to use his leadership of the Kennedy Center to vanquish leftist culture. One artist who chose to play, the folk guitarist Yasmin Williams, said that an organized group attended and heckled her.

Given the hollowing out of the schedule and Trump’s unpopularity in Washington, ticket and subscription-package sales have fallen steeply. The Washington Post found that since September, “43 percent of tickets remained unsold for the typical production. That means that, at most, 57 percent of tickets were sold for the typical production.” (Some of those tickets may have been given for free.) For comparison, 93 percent of tickets were sold or given for free in fall 2024. One of Grenell’s dictates was that the center would book only shows that broke even or were profitable, yet instead the center is driving patrons away. CNN reports that the Kennedy Center wasn’t even able to book performances for next season. Closing the doors for two years just makes official what was already happening.

Trump believed that if he grabbed the Kennedy Center’s reins and started booking shows that conformed to his taste—and to that of some of his friends and MAGA fans—the venue would be wildly popular. It turns out, though, that a 79-year-old New York–born billionaire whose tastes run to gilded accents and kitschy musicals isn’t a good proxy for either the general population or arts patrons in Washington. As my colleague Spencer Kornhaber recently wrote, Trump’s term dawned with expectations of a huge cultural shift. Instead, popular culture has remained stubbornly indifferent to MAGA aesthetics.

Trump keeps making a version of this error. His first term was a series of overreaches, all confidently executed in the belief that the silent majority would back him. Instead, he lost in 2020. His second-term win renewed his overconfidence. Now he believes that because many Americans wanted tighter border security, they will also support violent crackdowns in the streets of American cities; instead, his immigration approval keeps sinking. He believes that because he won the election in part on his promises to fix the economy, Americans are willing to tolerate high inflation; instead, polls show that voters’ confidence in the future is declining.

The closure of the center also fits into another pattern: As I wrote last week, Trump has proved adept at destroying things but shows little interest in building them back up. Trump’s previous predictions for the Kennedy Center haven’t borne out, so some skepticism is warranted now. Even if the physical overhaul succeeds, the center will still have the same problems of audience, artists, and staff when it’s done—only in a gaudier space. In effect, Trump appears to have graffitied his name on an empty shell. “I am doing the same thing to the United States of America, but only on a ‘slightly’ larger scale!” he wrote in an October post about the center’s makeover. This time around, his harshest critics might be the first ones to agree.

The Father-Daughter Divide

By Isabel Woodford

Growing up, Melissa Shultz sometimes felt like she had two fathers. One version of her dad, she told me, was playful and quick to laugh. He was a compelling storyteller who helped shape her career as a writer, and he gave great bear hugs. He often bought her small gifts: a pink “princess” phone when she was a teen, toys for her sons when she became a mom. Some of their most intimate moments came when she cut his hair; it was, she said, “a way to be close without talking.” He was there for her in hard times, too. When her engagement ended, he helped pack her things and drove her home.

But she told me their relationship could also be turbulent. The other version of her father was “dark” and would “get so angry” that he seemed to lose control. He would freeze her out for months at a time if she challenged him. He’d call her names, even in front of her own kids. He died when she was in her 30s, and she grieved intensely, though she doubted whether they ever fully understood each other. Now in her 60s, Shultz told me she still mourns the relationship.

        <hr/>
        President Donald Trump said Sunday that he plans to close the Kennedy Center for roughly two years for the facility to undergo construction. The proposal comes amid a series of cancellations and internal upheaval since he took over the arts institution and presidential memorial nearly a year ago and remade it in his name and image.

“I have determined that The Trump Kennedy Center, if temporarily closed for Construction, Revitalization, and Complete Rebuilding, can be, without question, the finest Performing Arts Facility of its kind, anywhere in the World,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “In other words, if we don’t close, the quality of Construction will not be nearly as good, and the time to completion, because of interruptions with Audiences from the many Events using the Facility, will be much longer.”

Under Trump’s proposal, which he said is subject to board approval, the Kennedy Center could close on July 4, coinciding with America’s 250th anniversary, with construction beginning immediately.

“Financing is completed, and fully in place!,” Trump wrote. “This important decision, based on input from many Highly Respected Experts, will take a tired, broken, and dilapidated Center … and turn it into a World Class Bastion of Arts, Music, and Entertainment, far better than it has ever been before.”

Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell confirmed the plans in a Sunday evening email to staff obtained by The Washington Post. “We will have more information about staffing and operational changes in the coming days,” he wrote.

In a post on X, Grenell cited the $257 million designated “for capital repair, restoration, maintenance backlog, and security structures” through the One Big Beautiful Bill last year.

“It desperately needs this renovation and temporarily closing the Center just makes sense … ,” Grenell wrote. “It also means we will be finished faster.”

The center has already made some physical changes under the new leadership, adding Trump’s name to the building’s facade, despite legal concerns, and painting the outside columns white. Portraits of the first and second couples now hang in the center’s Hall of Nations, and the exterior is sometimes lit up in red, white and blue.

It was not immediately clear what the closure would mean for annual events held at the center such as the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor or the Kennedy Center Honors.

The Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A White House official referred The Washington Post to Trump’s post.

Three current staffers, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said they had not been previously notified of any plans to close the center, though some had long speculated a shutdown was possible.

“Once again, Donald Trump has acted with a total disregard for Congress,” said Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), who had sued the Trump administration in December in her capacity as an ex officio trustee to stop the name change. “The Kennedy Center is congressionally funded, and Congress should have been consulted about any decision to shut down its operations or make major renovations, especially for two years,” she said in a statement.

Members of the Kennedy family responded to the news of the closure. Jack Schlossberg, John F. Kennedy’s grandson, wrote on X that while Trump can take over the institution, his grandfather’s legacy will endure. “JFK is kept alive by us now rising up to remove Donald Trump, bring him to justice, and restore the freedoms generations fought for,” he said.

Joe Kennedy III, Robert F. Kennedy’s grandson and a former Democratic congressman for Massachusetts, called the decision “painful,” saying that the center was built by and for the people as a shared point of connection.

“Do not be distracted from what this Administration is actually trying to erase: our connection, our community, and our commitment to the rights of all,” he wrote on X.

Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pennsylvania) condemned the move, saying on X that “Trump is desecrating our national performing arts center.” Sen. Andy Kim (D-New Jersey) pointed to Trump’s bad bet in the late 1980s on what was the world’s largest casino-hotel complex in his state. “We can’t let him do to the Kennedy Center what he did to Atlantic City,” he said in a tweet.

The center’s board in December voted to add the president’s name to the arts venue and presidential memorial — its sign now reads “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts” — prompting a fresh wave of cancellations and tumult.

Most recently, the Washington National Opera announced Jan. 9 it would move out of its longtime home, citing changes to the center’s business model and support.

The Kennedy Center said it ended the relationship, but a person speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to represent either party told The Post that it was “definitely a WNO decision” spurred by the board’s vote.

U.S. law and customs generally bar memorializing living figures. The statute establishing the center designates it as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and requires the board to “assure” that “no additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas” of the building. The law does allow plaques and inscriptions recognizing major donations.

Months before the renaming vote, the center’s board changed its bylaws to ensure only members appointed by the president had voting powers, The Post previously reported. The center said it was following long-standing practice.

Democratic lawmakers have introduced legislation and a lawsuit to reverse the addition of Trump’s name.

One of the groups behind the litigation is Democracy Defenders Action. In a statement Sunday, co-founder Norm Eisen questioned the motivations behind the center’s closure, which he said would inflict further damage. “We will be considering all legal remedies to address this new and concerning development,” he said.

Since remaking the board of trustees and becoming chairman of the Kennedy Center last February, Trump has frequently said the building was in poor shape. The Kennedy Center is “in tremendous disrepair, as is a lot of the rest of our country,” Trump told reporters in March. “Most of it, because of bad management. This is a shame, what I’ve watched and witnessed.”

Trump and his new leadership have claimed that the center has broken elevators, was infested with rats and that the concrete in the parking garage was crumbling.

They also repeatedly accused the previous leadership of financial mismanagement, declining requests from The Post to substantiate the claims. Former leaders denied the accusations. (Senate Democrats are themselves investigating the Kennedy Center, accusing Grenell of “self-dealing, favoritism, and waste,” which he has denied.)

Grenell has said the center will rely on “common-sense programming,” meaning popular programming that breaks even. In the past year, sales of subscription packages and tickets have fallen dramatically. Empty seats became a common sight at the center.

Dozens of artists and productions, including composer Philip Glass, soprano Renée Fleming, acclaimed banjoist Béla Fleck and “Wicked” composer Stephen Schwartz, have canceled upcoming events.

Meanwhile, almost every head of programming has resigned or been dismissed. Ben Folds and Fleming quit their roles as artistic advisers earlier last year. Last week, Kevin Couch, the center’s senior vice president of artistic programming resigned less than two weeks after his hiring was announced.

        <hr/>
        Sparklers sizzled, boom-badoom-boom bass thumped, and Nicki Minaj emerged onstage at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest last month to deliver the latest plot twist in an exhausting year for politics and pop culture. The rapper—whose straight black hair reached the hem of her sleek minidress—sat down with Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, who sported medieval-princess blond braids and waves. Then Minaj tore into previous presidential administrations for being un-Christian and uncool. “We can’t let people like that be in power, you guys,” she said, flaring her eyes like she does in the video for her song “Stupid Hoe.”

Minaj arrived in America at age 5 as an undocumented immigrant from Trinidad, and is still not, she said in 2024, an American citizen. Her music uses pornographic profanity to assert herself as a man-eating empress, and her fans—many of them queer—don pink wigs and call themselves “Barbz,” after Barbie. Yet here she was at a conference co-founded by Charlie Kirk, a defender of traditional gender roles who just last year called Minaj a poor role model for young Black women. Here she was, praising Donald Trump as the handsome redeemer of American pride.

Ever since the president danced with the Village People during last year’s inauguration weekend, the Trumpian right has been disorienting America with this kind of spectacle. Trolling and tackiness, often crossbred with left-coded pop songs and hot memes, have served to wish a new zeitgeist into existence. Consume only the output of MAGA’s multifront media efforts, and you may come to feel that the country is coalescing into pep-rally unity on Trump’s behalf. Minaj’s appearance at the Turning Point event gave the right a trophy to flaunt, signaling who the popular kids really are.

Any follower of Minaj’s knows what’s behind this kind of bravado. Like the killer doll Chucky, which she often references, or perhaps like Elon Musk wielding a chainsaw, her persona—big grin, nasty words—conveys cheerful cruelty. But it’s a performance of embattlement, not dominance—the offensive defense of someone everyone thinks of as “the bad guy,” per her song “Chun-Li.” She constantly seems beset by haters, rivals, and (in recent years) a public that doesn’t stream her music as much as she demands. Seeing her onstage drove home the desperation that has also defined MAGA’s imagery this past year, whether the example was ICE arrests turned into adorable anime or recruitment posters drawn in the same pastoral style as 1930s Germany. The president’s aesthetics are wackily fascist—but American culture, for now, remains peskily democratic.

Trump’s return to office was widely portrayed as christening a new definition of chic. Young voters and voters of color had swung in his direction, thanks partly to the influence of podcasts, livestreams, and other media formats that now compete with traditional news outlets and cultural institutions. The attendance of tech barons, comedians, and content creators at Trump’s inauguration indicated that the so-called alternative media was now the mainstream—and openly pro-Trump. Its touchstones appeared to be recently booming phenomena including country music, TikTok tradwives, and mixed martial arts.

Trump quickly began consolidating his cultural power by focusing on the old media that hadn’t fallen in line. He strong-armed news networks, intervened in Hollywood mergers, overtook and renamed the Kennedy Center, slashed public-broadcasting budgets, and recast the White House press corp. These efforts have borne results: sycophantic press conferences, DEI rollbacks at movie studios, a news chief at CBS whose nightly broadcast has delivered a “salute” to Marco Rubio and spent a mere 16 seconds covering the fifth anniversary of January 6.

These authoritarian-scented measures, combined with MAGA’s apparent command of new media, gestured at what Trump really needed to achieve his full agenda: cultural pacification and control. His policies are, however else you describe them, disruptive. Mass deporting migrants, brazenly axing federal grants and jobs, pursuing an inflationary trade war, risking the lives of soldiers to trouble the sovereignty of hemispheric neighbors—these things are shaking the everyday lives of Americans. Seeking a third term, as he has hinted at doing, would redefine the presidency itself. Such drastic measures should mean, in a free and open democracy, powerful pushback vented not only through the political process but also through artists and audiences.

Outcry has, indeed, resulted—though less of it, and less sharply rendered, than one might expect. Trump’s first term spurred the indefatigable and angry Resistance, with its mocking “tiny hands” imagery and battalion of celebrities. This time, the popular protest movement is “No Kings,” which has made a point of presenting itself as a vague and upbeat pro-democracy effort. Once-outspoken entertainers have been a bit quieter of late as well. The actor Jennifer Lawrence told The New York Times that the past decade has discouraged her from using her platform for politics.

The animated pushback to ICE in Minneapolis over recent weeks marks a return to a more confrontational style of protest. But the situation in that city has also demonstrated MAGA’s methods for stigmatizing dissent. The death of the activist Renee Nicole Good at the hands of an immigration agent has been justified on the right in a fashionable tone of detachment. The right-wing pundit Erick Erickson labeling Good an “AWFUL”—an Affluent White Female Urban Liberal—stereotypes the opposition as not just wrongheaded but cringe, so cringe it doesn’t matter at all.

Yet, in important ways, the cultural feedback loop remains intact and significant. Take the Jimmy Kimmel incident. In September, the talk-show host seemed to imply, incorrectly, that Kirk’s killer was a MAGA supporter. The Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr, threatened ABC, Kimmel’s network, which announced his show’s indefinite removal from its time slot. The ensuing outcry from the public, including from alt-media figures such as Joe Rogan, was deafening, and Kimmel quickly returned to the air. One lesson from that episode: Whatever motives underlay ABC’s initial decision, they were not powerful enough to justify the mess it caused.

Another lesson is that the same ecosystem that helped elect Trump is also independent from him. Rogan, the superstar podcaster credited with helping sway the 2024 election, has not only griped about Kimmel; he’s also questioned the White House’s immigration crackdown and tariffs. Andrew Schulz, another popular comedian and podcaster, declared that Trump’s foreign policy and spending bills are “the exact opposite of everything I voted for.” The streamer Adin Ross, who gave Trump a car during the 2024 campaign, now says he regrets ever talking politics, because it’s had the effect of tarnishing his brand.

None of these figures has exactly gone blue, but their griping is in line with what polls have shown about Trump’s softening support among young people, men, and people of color. His appeal to those groups in 2024, it seems, was rooted in something other than stereotypical MAGA loyalty. The “freethinking” moniker that Rogan and others give themselves can seem risible—they’re so freethinking that they’re willing to entertain conspiracy theories and superstition—but it does, in fact, have some basis in truth.

And though the government can threaten the licenses of news networks, the internet is more difficult to tame. To be sure, Musk’s overhaul of X to make it friendlier to white nationalists, Mark Zuckerberg’s rollback of Meta’s moderation regime, and TikTok’s Trump-assisted sale to a group of investors led by the conservative billionaire Larry Ellison all suggest the extent to which web culture can be shaped and distorted by its platforms. But a podcaster is still just someone with a mic and an audience. Short of outright criminalizing dissent or resorting to mafioso intimidation—neither out of the question—Trump has no simple recourse against the online crowd other than the one he has always had, the one that politicians in a democracy are supposed to use: persuasion.

One person who understood persuasion was Charlie Kirk, whose killing might be the most culturally consequential development of the past year. Kirk grasped how the internet has changed America, but his death has demonstrated—and, disturbingly, may have resulted from—the fundamentally anarchic nature of those changes.

Kirk rose to prominence by bridging the roles of activist, influencer, and party spokesman in a manner that connected with young people and shaped consensus on the right. In early 2025, he helped diminish GOP opposition to RFK Jr.’s confirmation as health secretary by vowing to organize primary challengers. He later downplayed the delayed release of the Jeffrey Epstein files by saying he held “trust” in his “friends in the government to do what needs to be done”—a position that only someone who’d himself accrued enormous trust from his followers could possibly maintain.

After Kirk’s death, all sorts of narratives started to break down. For example, his alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, is a highly online young, white, male video gamer—which is to say, he is the kind of person who was thought to be driving America’s conservative wave. But according to evidence cited by police, he saw Kirk as a font of “hate.” Immediately after the shooting, he logged on to the social network Discord to chat with his friends, suggesting that he was performing for the sort of micro-audience upon which the nation’s fragmented culture is now built. (Robinson has not yet entered a plea of guilt or innocence.)

Kirk’s allies quickly tried to tell a new story—one of Kirk as sacred martyr. When others questioned that portrayal by citing Kirk’s more callous stances—on immigrants, guns, and trans people—Trump saw an opportunity to further pursue his anti-dissent agenda. His administration began labeling liberal advocacy groups as terrorists. J. D. Vance encouraged the punishment of anyone seen celebrating Kirk’s death. At least 600 people were subsequently fired from their jobs for social-media posts and public statements, some of which extolled the murder and some of which just quoted the victim’s own words.

But months later, the campaign to sanctify Kirk appears to have backfired in some ways. Gen Z and Gen Alpha’s highly ironic meme ecosystem has embraced what’s called “Kirkification”: the use of AI to meld Kirk’s face with all sorts of characters—superheroes, rappers, porn actors. The intentions of the Kirkifiers vary wildly. Some meme makers are admirers of Kirk who want to valorize him; some are neo-Nazis out to mock Kirk for not being extreme enough (while also drawing attention to their cause); some are liberals trying to troll conservatives; many are surely apolitical types having a nonsensical laugh. In most cases, the effect is to flout any top-down insistence on reverence, a party line, or a unified myth.

The assassination of Trump’s best mouthpiece also destabilized the online right. With Kirk gone, doubts and disagreements about Israel, tariffs, and—the big one—Epstein have spun out in a variety of directions. They’ve been stoked by a class of influencer pundits, such as Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes, who are angling to fill the cultural vacuum left by Kirk. But unlike him, they profess no particular fealty to a party establishment. They are moving by the logic of online entertainment, which, at this moment, is driven by demand for conspiracy theories and conflict—in opposition, at times, to MAGA itself.

Meanwhile, traditional opposition has been enduring a demoralization campaign via federally funded trolling. Stunts such as taking over the Kennedy Center and snarkily relabeling presidential portraits should be understood partly as efforts to exhaust opponents while letting supporters feel like they’re in on a joke. The maxims “Don’t feed the trolls” and “Don’t take the bait” can seem like enlightened responses—but in effect, they serve Trump’s need for cultural pacification.

Perhaps this is why the administration has taken the bizarre step of actively seeking confrontations with celebrities. Government-run social-media accounts have been posting political “fancams”—highlight reels that stans make to celebrate their obsessions—set to music and sounds by popular entertainers. One video pairs photos of Trump with the swooning sound of a Taylor Swift song; another mashes up a video snippet of the comedian Theo Von and shots of immigrants getting deported.

These clips work on the level of propaganda by portraying Trump’s agenda as swashbuckling and hip. But they also create ultimatums for entertainers. Should stars who object to the use of their work publicly complain—as did Von, a Trump-friendly podcaster who nevertheless didn’t like being associated with the immigration crackdowns? Or should they stay above the fray—as has Swift, a onetime Trump critic whose silence on politics over the past year has unnerved some of her fans? Or should they go meta—as did the singer SZA, who wrote on X that the administration was “rage baiting artists for free promo”?

Complaining certainly seems like a headache. In December, in another video, Sabrina Carpenter’s puppy-love anthem “Juno” was paired with deportation imagery. In response, the singer posted, “This video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.” The White House then shot back a statement that referenced her lyrics, asking whether she was “stupid” or “slow.” When Variety asked the government about its use of Swift’s music, a spokesperson said, “We made this video because we knew fake-news media brands like Variety would breathlessly amplify them. Congrats, you got played.”

Obnoxiousness like that is probably best understood as an attempt at reverse psychology. The administration’s fancam videos generate millions of views, and many attempts to not “amplify” Trump have only proved counterproductive. To a casual internet scroller, seeing these videos circulate without controversy might imply acquiescence from the performers featured in them. And acquiescence can be contagious. In other words, the administration may be systematically testing cultural figures out of the understanding that they still hold sway. They can still speak out, and it still matters if they do, or if they don’t. So they probably should.

As for Minaj, she’s an example of what MAGA leaders likely dream of gaining from their trolling efforts: support. The rapper began her open flirtation with the right in November by reposting an official White House video that used one of her songs. After she publicly expressed concern about reports of persecution of Christians in Nigeria, the administration brought her to address a United Nations panel on the topic. Soon she was writing on X that Trump and Vance were “the good guys,” and she started feuding with Gavin Newsom.

During Trump’s first administration, Minaj expressed horror at his immigration policies. Theories now abound as to what changed since she said, in 2020, that she’s “not gonna jump on the Donald Trump bandwagon.” One common explanation is that she’s shopping for a pardon for her husband, who was convicted of attempted rape in 1995. Others point out that she has alienated much of the music industry by feuding with liberal stars including Jay-Z, Cardi B, and Megan Thee Stallion. Jay-Z is the head of the team that programs the Super Bowl halftime show; might Minaj want to headline Turning Point USA’s alternative halftime show?

But maybe her conversion is genuine. As she talked onstage with Erika Kirk, Minaj’s voice ached while she described her own journey with Christianity. She was raised as a devout churchgoer, lapsed in her faith as she rose to stardom, and now wants to come back into the fold. I thought of Little Richard, Prince, Ye, and other colorful, crass pop predecessors of Minaj’s who were shaped by the church in early life and turned to conservative Christianity in midlife. Maybe Minaj is undergoing a very normal journey for someone like her—simply at an abnormal time in American history.

When I opened up social media after her Turning Point appearance, my feeds were full of Barbz renouncing their membership in what had been the most loyal and fervent of all pop fandoms. I saw Minaj sparring with critics and critics sparring with one another. I had the strange thought that Minaj and the dustup around her is an example of the speech rights that have survived the past year—and I felt grateful for all of the competing forces and factions that remain too complex for politics to control.

        <hr/>
        At the federal level and on down, American government has come to rely heavily on nonprofits to deliver public services. This dependence is in many ways understandable, but it comes with serious risks. Feeding our Future, the Minnesota nonprofit whose employees were caught billing for services they didn’t provide, was not the first instance of an NGO stealing from taxpayers, nor will it be the last.

NGOs—private nonprofits that receive government funding—theoretically offer a nimble, targeted way to put policy into effect. Progressives like their grassroots nature; conservatives like that they might offer something closer to private-sector efficiency. Some NGOs perform admirably. Many others don’t, and evidence is scant that this system overall delivers services better than the government. Despite this record, in the past several decades, NGOs have become not so much a policy instrument under democratic control as a sprawling, semiautonomous administrative system with little accountability.

NGOs emerged as an alternative to direct government services during the latter decades of the 20th century. The first growth spurt came in the 1960s. President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty saw NGOs as a means of fusing big-government spending with localistic sensibilities. According to the then-influential philosophy of “community action,” top-down solutions to social problems ran the unacceptable risk of race- and class-based discrimination. What’s more, adherents believed, if the government truly wanted to address poverty’s root causes, the poor needed to be involved in leading and running organizations meant to help them.

From the outset, this system was flawed. The Community Action Program sent federal funds to organizations and gave them broad leeway to determine how best to use those funds. The program foundered on spectacular failures, which were chronicled in works such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s Maximum Feasible Misunderstanding (1969) and Tom Wolfe’s “Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers” (1970). Poverty pimp entered the vernacular as shorthand for a nonprofit leader who became expert at accessing federal money while deflecting oversight demands as anti-poor.

The “social-service industrial complex,” as this model came to be pejoratively known, proved somewhat more useful in reforming existing social services than launching new ones. Public mental-health and housing programs, run by state governments and local housing authorities, respectively, predated the War on Poverty. In both, centralized government bureaucracies were responsible for the lives of hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Americans. Both also boasted poor outcomes; public housing perpetuated intergenerational poverty, and many patients confined to mental asylums for years seemed worse than when they had been committed. Over time, more than 90 percent of public psychiatric-hospital beds in the United States were cut, and resources shifted to community-based mental-health programs, many of which were operated by private NGOs. At the local level, nonprofit affordable-housing developments became standard as cities across the nation demolished their public-housing projects.

Both of these changes fell short of expectations, however. Deinstitutionalizing the mentally ill left many of them homeless or incarcerated. And many of their family members or caregivers have said that the community-based mental-health system is too fragmented, making it hard to navigate. As for housing, few people outside socialist circles want to bring the projects back. But affordability concerns are now more acute than ever. And communities with high concentrations of modern forms of affordable housing still struggle with poverty and dependency.

Support for the NGO model became bipartisan during the “reinventing government” era of the 1990s. Republican governors as well as the Clinton administration urged public systems to seek inspiration from private industry. Although privatization (also sometimes called “not-for-profitization”) had several applications, the most famous was public charter schools. Much as with asylums and housing, urban school districts faced criticism for their dismal outcomes and top-heavy organization. Reformers proposed schools that would be taxpayer funded but run by independent organizations, typically nonprofits, and that would be academically accountable, up to and including facing closure. The idea proved wildly popular and led to many excellent new schools. But the promised accountability remained elusive; closing underperforming charters proved easier said than done.

Conservative-led welfare- and pension-reform initiatives helped fuel the expansion of NGOs in government. The 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act imposed time limits and work requirements on cash welfare; it also made block-grant funds available to states for work-promoting activities such as job training and counseling. Cash handouts don’t require NGOs, but delivering these employment services did. As the political scientist Steven Rathgeb Smith has pointed out, the 1996 law actually made the NGO workforce larger.

In the years immediately following the Great Recession, most states passed legislation reforming their pension systems. Conservative analysts convinced officials that trimming public workers’ payouts would help avoid catastrophes such as bankruptcy, which befell several cities at the time. Another solution to the pension crisis was simply to rely more on workers who were ineligible for pensions in the first place and, therefore, were cheaper to hire—namely NGO employees. Two priorities of city progressives in the 2010s were expanding homeless services and developing alternatives to incarceration. According to public financial filings, some New York–based NGOs in those sectors have, this century, seen their workforces grow by 500 percent or more. During that same period, New York City’s municipal workforce has grown only 12 percent. New York City’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, says he will prioritize subsidizing child care and reducing the role of for-profit landlords in the housing market. Both will likely mean new or expanded lines of business for the NGO sector.

As this model expands at every level of government, it carries serious downsides, beginning with a lack of accountability. Because they are private entities, NGOs aren’t subject to public-records requests. Their leaders are neither elected nor appointed by an elected official, and their head counts don’t show up in municipal-workforce numbers, meaning that using NGOs to enact policy conceals the government’s true size. In public administration, lack of transparency can sometimes be justified. But it always comes at a cost.

When public services are administered at arm’s length from duly constituted public authorities, organizations like Feeding Our Future can better obscure corruption. A June 2024 report published by the Minnesota Office of the Legislative Auditor argued that “inadequate oversight” by state government abetted the fraud. Prosecutors claimed that although state agencies held ultimate power, Feeding Our Future intimidated them by wielding “accusations of racism.” More than 50 individuals have been convicted; $250 million was stolen. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz last month ended his 2026 reelection campaign, and possibly his nearly two-decade political career, because of the scandal.

Instances of outright criminality can distract from NGOs’ subtler corruption issues. NGO CEOs earn salaries that exceed those enjoyed by public-agency heads and even mayors or governors. They are not subject to term limits. Their titles confer status in certain circles. Government officials who yearn for those kinds of jobs might, in turn, be incentivized to avoid making enemies with the nonprofits whose work they are supposed to monitor. Clean-government advocates harp on the unseemliness of public officials overseeing industries that they hope to work in someday. The criticism is valid whether the industry in question is banking or mental-health services.

Conservatives who encourage the outsourcing of government work to NGOs should be wary for ideological reasons. When more progressives get elected, budgets grow, and so do NGO revenues and personnel. NGO workforces tilt leftward, meaning the government sometimes ends up putting public services in the hands of people with a distinct political agenda. For example, some progressives have turned to NGOs that encourage decarceration or push for social workers to handle certain law-enforcement tasks. Those kinds of investments can shift resources away from correctional and police officers, who are more expensive because of their union-protected health and retirement benefits. Governments might end up hiring more politically progressive NGO employees while reducing head counts of more politically conservative law-enforcement employees.

The conflicts of interests and lack of transparency that attend NGO governance can be justified if they are outweighed by the benefits. But as government dependence on NGOs has grown over the decades, it’s been hard to see how contracting out government functions has cut costs or made service delivery more effective. At this point, NGOs might be too entrenched in federal, state, and local governments for Americans to roll back their influence. NGOs are used in countless policy contexts, and they still enjoy bipartisan support. Even if the model cannot be replaced, we should aspire to a better version of it. Reformers should focus on systematic, careful oversight. Every so often, public officials should consider yanking contracts, if for no other reason than to reestablish their authority. After all, they’re the ones we voted for.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> This article explores a shift in Donald Trump's management style during his second term, focusing on his preference for publicly humiliating cabinet members rather than firing them immediately. Using Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's precarious position as a case study, it argues that Trump now prioritizes hyper-loyalty and a 'no scalps' policy to avoid appearing pressured by critics, even in the wake of significant scandals or failures.

        <hr/>
        When a conspicuous presidential project goes awry—in this case, federal immigration agents killing two protesters in Minnesota—someone typically loses their job. And for much of this week, Kristi Noem’s deportation from the Trump administration seemed imminent.

Public confidence in the president’s handling of immigration has been plummeting. And as the secretary of Homeland Security—and the ostentatious face of President Trump’s high-profile ICE and Customs and Border Protection dragnets—Noem has seemed the logical sacrifice. Washington loves a good Cabinet deathwatch, just as Trump loves a good public expulsion. Or at least he used to. By this point in his first term, his “You’re fired” bit had migrated seamlessly from TV to politics: His White House had already bled out a national security adviser (Michael Flynn), press secretary (Sean Spicer), chief of staff (Reince Priebus), chief strategist (Steve Bannon), and secretary of Health and Human Services (Tom Price).

But in what can perhaps be called a minor upset, Noem was still in her role by week’s end. Instead, she had been left to twist very publicly in the wind. In a sense, this marks a subtle shift in Trump’s humiliation methods. Rather than firing officials outright—in a quick and relatively straightforward directive, or a tweet—he now seems to prefer sowing public doubt and maximizing attention upon the ultimate decider of someone’s fate: that person, of course, being himself.

For those wearing the putative target on their back, this can surely be agonizing. But Trump seems to rather enjoy this dance. He gets to be puppet master for the whole spectacle—dropping hints, leaving everybody guessing and at his mercy—and all without the hassle of having to find a replacement.

At certain points in his second term, various Cabinet secretaries have allegedly been on the outs but then managed to survive. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s name has circulated, especially since Trump sent her a direct message in September—and then accidentally posted it on Truth Social—urging her to be more aggressive in targeting his political enemies. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth survived a near miss last year after a group of high-level national-security officials erroneously added The Atlantic’s editor in chief to a private Signal group chat, where Hegseth shared military attack plans. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz was replaced over the episode but still wound up remaining in Trump’s Cabinet as ambassador to the United Nations.

The lack of high-level turnover in this White House says plenty about the nature of this Trump administration compared with the first. Whereas his previous term included several relatively experienced and responsible actors willing to disagree with the president, Trump consciously assembled a collection of hyper-loyalists this time around, people focused wholly on carrying out his wishes. Ultimately, if Trump sees a top aide as fulfilling that mission, he has been willing to overlook many shortcomings and embarrassments. He is also, clearly, trying to adhere to a “no scalps” rule, loath to be seen as bowing to pressure from anyone or giving his opponents any satisfaction.

For as much as he relishes his public perception as a tough-guy boss, the last thing Trump seems to want is friction from his underlings. And at least so far this term, he has tended to reward their overheated devotion with loyalty, up to a point. “I think she’s doing a very good job,” Trump said of Noem as he departed the White House on Tuesday for a trip to Iowa. His dutiful tone was reminiscent of a sports-team owner issuing a vote of confidence to a coach suffering through an extended losing streak.

Noem’s slow walk down the Cabinet plank started last weekend, when a 37-year-old ICU nurse, Alex Pretti, was fatally shot by CBP officers in Minneapolis while he was protesting Trump’s immigration crackdown in the city. Noem immediately labeled Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and claimed, without proof, that his goal was “to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.” Noem’s performance did not play well, especially after videos of the incident contradicted her version of events. The White House distanced the president from her claims. A bacchanal of blame-shifting ensued.

In a statement, the White House immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller suggested that CBP—overseen by Noem’s department—might not have been following proper protocol, and that the initial assessment from DHS about the incident was based on reports from CBP on the ground. Border Patrol’s battering-ram commander, Gregory Bovino, was pulled out of Minnesota, and Trump dispatched his bull-necked “border czar,” Tom Homan, to take over operations there. My colleagues Michael Scherer and Nick Miroff reported this week that some career DHS officials “see Noem’s approach as ad hoc, performative, and possibly motivated by her own political ambitions.” According to an account in Axios, Noem has said, “Everything I’ve done, I’ve done at the direction of the president and Stephen.”

In announcing Homan’s assignment in Minnesota, Trump said Homan would report directly to him, not Noem. Homan held a news conference Thursday morning in which he said, “I didn’t come to Minnesota for photo ops or headlines,” which was impossible not to construe as a shot at Noem and Bovino. Noem’s zeal for photo ops in over-the-top military-style getups has been well established and widely mocked—and earned her the somewhat sexist nickname “ICE Barbie.”

Even as she has been sidelined, Noem has remained the majordomo of the debacle. Democrats have pushed for her removal and threatened her impeachment. Republican Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have also called for Noem’s resignation. “She has taken this administration into the ground on an issue that we should own,” Tillis told reporters, referring to the issue—immigration—that arguably got Trump reelected. Trump dismissed Tillis and Murkowski as “losers,” and Tillis, in turn, said that he was “thrilled” by the characterization, because it meant that he, too, was “qualified to be Homeland Security secretary.” “I continue to tell the president you’ve got to get the amateurs out of the Oval Office for his own sake,” Tillis told Politico, referring to Noem and Miller.

As is customary when any White House official faces heat, discussion of potential replacements has been rampant. “It is my informed opinion that Kristi Noem should go and Tom Homan should take her place,” the informed-opinion-haver Ben Shapiro said on the Daily Wire’s The Ben Shapiro Show. Also receiving speculation (informed or otherwise): former Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, and former Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah.

On Thursday, Trump convened a Cabinet meeting that featured the cringey exercise of top officials taking turns slathering praise upon the boss. This, at the very least, offered Noem the chance to show proof of life, as well as to grovel her way back into the president’s good graces. It also, in theory, allowed Trump the opportunity to toss some much-needed affirmation her way.

But it was not to be. Trump never called on Noem to speak. Like in Minnesota, it can get cold in Washington.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Former Survivor contestant Stephen Fishbach’s debut novel, Escape!, provides an insider’s perspective on reality TV production through a fictional survival competition. The literary thriller explores the psychological drive to control personal narratives and the moral complexities behind 'The Edit,' drawing comparisons to modern social media self-presentation.

        <hr/>
        There’s a saying on Survivor: “Perception is reality.” There’s a saying on TikTok: “Do it for the plot.”

Both maxims are about the stories people tell themselves. The first acknowledges that someone’s read of a situation will shape the outcome—even if they’re reading things wrong. The second declares that all of life is a story and you need to provide the drama.

The desire to treat life as a narrative—and then control that narrative—is the subject of Stephen Fishbach’s debut novel, Escape!, a literary thriller that follows a single season of a fictional reality survival show from casting to airtime. Fishbach writes from experience: He was a two-time contestant on Survivor and co-hosts a Survivor podcast. To inform his book, he interviewed many other reality contestants and crew members. The result marries the plot twists of a competition show with compassionate portraits of the people involved who are searching for identity and meaning. It’s both an examination of how the reality-TV sausage gets made and a reminder that people can sacrifice their humanity if they focus too much on making the plot—of a television program, of life itself—exciting.

Escape! joins many other stories inspired by reality television. The Lifetime show UnREAL, which was co-created by a former Bachelor producer, similarly offered an insider’s view of the underbelly of reality-TV production. Books such as Suzanne Collins’s The Hunger Games and Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah’s Chain-Gang All-Stars use reality TV as scaffolding for dystopias in which entertainment is used to numb a populace to injustice. Aisling Rawle’s 2025 book The Compound features a Big Brother–meets–dating show setup as a way to explore how materialist greed can impede connection. The drama alone of reality TV makes it a compelling subject for fiction. But the genre feels particularly relevant today, more than 25 years after the first season of Survivor aired, when anyone with a social-media account can perform a version of themselves on a small screen. Every Instagram or TikTok post presents questions of how to edit a life.

Fishbach’s novel stands out because it explores the complicated dynamics of self-narrativizing—and because it’s enriched by the behind-the-scenes details informed by his firsthand experience. The show in Escape! is not Survivor, but it rhymes: Both have an island-jungle setting, outdoor-obstacle-course competitions, alliances, and backstabbing. Both administer a personality test during casting and keep players’ medications in a box in the jungle out of sight of cameras. Contestants can tell when their fellow players are plotting, Fishbach writes, because the crew moves the boom mic closer to them. (Fishbach writes in an author’s note that though many plot points are inspired by true events, “nothing in this book should be taken to impugn” the staff of Survivor. And Survivor exists in the world of the novel, as if to emphasize that Fishbach isn’t really describing the show he was once on.) He’s a funny observer of some of the genre’s more ridiculous tropes. When the contestants compete for a food reward, he writes that they “rub their stomachs and pull O-faces at the idea of these soggy pastries, mirroring the reaction shots they’ve seen from other contestants on previous shows.” Although a couple of the producer characters veer into cartoonish villainy, for the most part Fishbach manages to critique reality TV while maintaining empathy for those who make it.

Driving the novel is each character’s relentless pursuit of a story arc that they hope will redeem, transform, or elevate them. All of Fishbach’s characters—Miriam, the timid young contestant who hopes the show will give her a life-changing revelation; Kent, the has-been reality star looking to recapture his former glory; Beck, the disgraced producer projecting her issues onto the cast; and a collection of other reality-show archetypes who populate the background—are laser-focused on The Edit. (The Edit is “shorthand for the story that a TV show tells about a character,” as Beck explains. “Our job is to simplify and clarify.”)

Fishbach surely knows a thing or two about how the narrative structure of reality TV flattens people. In his first appearance, on Survivor: Tocantins, he has said he was portrayed as “more heroic than I am,” while in his second season, Survivor: Cambodia, he was sometimes played for laughs. “During its airing, I felt a lot of shame every week wondering which of my moments would be edited for maximum comic effect,” he told Entertainment Weekly. In Escape!, Fishbach portrays The Edit as, at best, a necessary evil, and, at worst, a life-ruining malevolence. The players obsess over how the show will digest their actions, what kind of narrative it will spit out. Will they get a Loser Edit or a Hero Edit? When Kent approaches the island for the first time, for example, he is “already thinking about how he’ll describe it in his interviews.” The producers manipulate the players into embodying the characters they preordained during casting and pat themselves on the back for constructing such a good story. Beck is not above using a woman’s dead son to make her emotional enough to quit, or browbeating Miriam into killing a pig for the sake of her “growth arc.” Compelled to redo a shark hunt that the cameras missed the first time, one contestant gets seriously injured.

Even as the producers’ manipulations turn dangerous, Escape! is clear that the contestants are complicit co-creators of their simplified selves. Kent, Fishbach writes, is “not here for the cash, or the plotting and scheming, or the banter. He’s here to slip into the old costume, which has started to sag and tear. He’s here to be Kent Duvall.” The heroic character he was edited into during his first season feels more real to him than the miserable person he is in his actual life. He’s trying to return to a self that only ever existed on a screen. Miriam goes along with Beck’s heavy-handed suggestions that she, not Kent, should be the hero, in part because she thinks the show might transform her into a new, somehow truer version of herself.

Although most readers of Escape! will never find themselves competing on TV, the characters’ concerns are relatable. Humans can’t help but see life as a narrative. An innate part of our psychology is arranging memories, experiences, and desires into a coherent story. Psychologists say that these stories form our personalities, our very selves. Reality TV preys on this natural impulse and can warp it to dehumanizing extremes.

Fishbach captures how reality TV takes the internal process of turning your life into a story, and makes it external. Who hasn’t replayed a moment in their mind, imagining what they could have done differently, what they should have said? The contestants on Escape! really do relive the same moment over and over with slight variations, as the camera operators insist on take after take. They get feedback from producers in real time on whether they’re living up to the role they’re supposed to play. It’s intoxicating: “On the show, every morsel of food he ate, how long he slept, every passing whim or frustration, mattered urgently to the producers,” Kent thinks. “It was how life should be, all the purposefulness of a religion, that the trivial opinions and feuds of your tiny existence mattered in the eyes of God.”

Reality television isn’t the only place where people can elevate their tiny existence into a grand narrative. Social media has long encouraged users to present their lives as easily legible stories—a mindset that seems to have intensified in recent years. During the height of the pandemic, posters diagnosed themselves and others with “main-character syndrome,” which, depending on whom you ask, is either a form of extreme narcissism or a way of empowering yourself by pretending you’re the star of a movie. The internet serves up a buffet of character types that people can strive to become or avoid becoming: clean girl, tradwife, Pilates princess, performative male, Chad. And if you’re wondering if you should do something ill-advised, such as text your ex, posters may cheekily encourage you to “do it for the plot.”

The sheer volume of stories people are exposed to in modern life can drown out the ability to hear one’s own true voice. At one point in Escape!, Beck wonders whether her work of unearthing contestants’ stories has any meaning, when so many meanings are imposed on everyone from the outside: “Maybe the very idea of depths, of an ‘authentic self,’ was merely another story, buried under layers of stories,” Fishbach writes. “We were all palimpsests of platitudes.”

Yet the book doesn’t give in to that despair. Toward the end of the novel, Kent remembers a touching moment with fellow contestants from his first TV appearance. He realizes he forgot it for years because it didn’t make the show’s final cut. When you edit down the mess of life, something is always deleted. But perhaps, Fishbach suggests, it’s not lost forever.

        <hr/>
        Growing up, Melissa Shultz sometimes felt like she had two fathers. One version of her dad, she told me, was playful and quick to laugh. He was a compelling storyteller who helped shape her career as a writer, and he gave great bear hugs. He often bought her small gifts: a pink “princess” phone when she was a teen, toys for her sons when she became a mom. Some of their most intimate moments came when she cut his hair; it was, she said, “a way to be close without talking.” He was there for her in hard times, too. When her engagement ended, he helped pack her things and drove her home.

But she told me their relationship could also be turbulent. The other version of her father was “dark” and would “get so angry” that he seemed to lose control. He would freeze her out for months at a time if she challenged him. He’d call her names, even in front of her own kids. He died when she was in her 30s, and she grieved intensely, though she doubted whether they ever fully understood each other. Now in her 60s, Shultz told me she still mourns the relationship.

Shultz’s story may sound familiar to some other fathers and daughters. In the 1990s, the journalist Victoria Secunda wrote in her book Women and Their Fathers that “enriching attachments” between dads and daughters were “astonishingly rare.” Secunda had interviewed 150 daughters and 75 dads and found that most of the relationships they described were marked by “too much distance.” Two decades later, the psychologist Peggy Drexler wrote in her 2011 book Our Fathers, Ourselves, which drew on interviews with dozens of women, that daughters were prone to using the refrain “I love my dad, but …”

Evidence of a dad-daughter divide crops up in more recent research on families, too. Fathers and daughters are more likely to become estranged than other pairs within the nuclear family. According to a 2022 study of national longitudinal data, roughly 28 percent of women in the U.S. are estranged from their dad; that’s only slightly higher than the 24 percent of sons estranged from their father but significantly higher than the 6.3 percent of children of any gender estranged from their mother. Even in cases where contact isn’t completely cut off, father-daughter relationships tend to be less close than other familial bonds. In a 2010 study, adult daughters reported feeling less comfortable discussing personal issues with their father than they did with their mother, and relying on their dad for “instrumental support” rather than emotional care. Linda Nielsen, a professor at Wake Forest University who has studied father-daughter relationships for much of her career and written five books on the topic, has called it the weakest parent-child relationship. Of course, plenty of women have a close and loving relationship with their father. But the research is clear: Many do not.

This tension hurts both fathers and daughters. Women’s bond with their dad may be linked to the quality of their mental health and romantic relationships, Nielsen wrote in Father-Daughter Relationships. And, as one 2023 study shows, parents (and especially fathers) who were in regular contact with their adult kids were, on average, more satisfied with their lives. Dads and daughters who grow apart speak of immense pain. Each craves closeness, but neither side seems sure how to get there.

At the root of the modern father-daughter divide seems to be a mismatch in expectations. Fathers, generally speaking, have for generations been less involved than mothers in their kids’ (and especially their daughters’) lives. But lots of children today expect more: more emotional support and more egalitarian treatment. Many fathers, though, appear to have struggled to adjust to their daughters’ expectations. The result isn’t a relationship that has suddenly ruptured so much as one that has failed to fully adapt.

While reporting this article, I spoke with a dozen college-educated women, most of whom told me that their bond with their father lacked depth: Their conversations stayed superficial and could feel awkward, and their dad hardly ever showed vulnerability. Several said they feared their father’s anger. Others told me they rarely hugged. Few regularly had one-on-one time with their dad.

According to some researchers, that lack of quality time together—particularly in childhood—is an acute factor straining father-daughter bonds. “Parenting time is closely related to the quality of your relationship with that parent,” Nielsen told me, and lots of fathers and daughters just don’t get enough of it. Women with kids younger than 6 spend, on average, about an hour more each day caring for their children than men do, according to the 2024 American Time Use Survey. And when dads do care for their kids, they have traditionally been found to devote more time to their boys: One 2012 study that looked at kids ages 8 and up found that in brother-sister pairs, sons spent more time with their dad than daughters did.

As kids reach high school, the discrepancy in how much time dads spend with their sons versus their daughters balloons. The 2012 study found that by age 17, girls were averaging less than 30 minutes a week one-on-one with their dad, while boys got more than an hour; fathers and teen daughters hung out less than any other familial combination. Part of the time gap seems to stem from the fact that teen boys tend to want to spend more time with their dad, and teen girls largely gravitate toward their mom. But Will Glennon, a writer who interviewed hundreds of fathers for his 1995 book, Fathering, told me that many dads also distance themselves from their adolescent daughters. Most of the fathers he spoke with were uncomfortable watching their girls go through puberty. That stage felt volatile, and the dads had “no idea” what their daughters were dealing with—so they withdrew. This was a reaction that Glennon said he understood: He’d also struggled when his daughter was a teen.

For the nearly one-third of American children whose parents divorce, the time deficit can be especially profound. Only a third of those separations result in equal joint custody, and mothers are more likely to become the primary caregiver. Partly for this reason, 21 percent of U.S. children don’t live with their biological father, according to the Census Bureau. Of course, parental separation touches sons, too, but it can be particularly ruinous for father-daughter relationships. One 20-year study measured the quality of relationships between fathers and their adult children post-divorce and found that three times more daughters than sons felt that the bond had significantly deteriorated. Candace McCullough, a family therapist in Maryland, told me that in her practice, divorce and affairs are among the most serious factors harming father-daughter relationships.

For much of history, until women married they largely relied on their father for material support. The bond between them tended to be based on a sense of mutual duty, and daughters were expected to be deferential. That changed over the course of the 20th century. As more women attained higher education and achieved financial independence, the traditional basis for father-daughter relationships eroded.

Today, children generally desire more closeness with both of their parents well into adulthood. But while many moms are prepared to provide the intimacy their children crave, the shake-up has caught lots of fathers off guard, Joshua Coleman, a psychologist specializing in family relationships, told me. He said that, based on his clinical experience, many fathers are ill-equipped to meet their kids’—and especially their daughters’—needs. “What generates closeness is another person’s vulnerability,” Coleman explained, and dads may not be ready for that. Niobe Way, an NYU professor who has extensively researched men and boys, told me that the disconnect may be rooted partly in how many modern fathers were brought up “in a context that was just so repressive” and “hypermasculine.” Daughters, she said, are generally “more free to express their feelings.”

Nearly all of the women I interviewed described a painful discordance with their dad. (Most asked to be identified by their first name only, to speak candidly about the relationship.) “I’m just like, ‘Show your emotions,’” Claire, a 43-year-old educator living in France, told me. Her mother died by suicide 20 years ago, she said, and she longs to talk about her with her father. She wonders whether he thinks about her mom. “I’ve never asked him,” she said. And he hasn’t asked her, either. Louise, a former doctor in her 40s living in England, also rarely sees her dad engage emotionally. He’ll “shut things down” if she tries to discuss his personal life. Min, a 29-year-old who grew up in South Korea but now lives in London, also told me that her dad rarely asks about her life; she’s unsure if he even knows how old she is or where she works. He instead focuses on supporting her with practical matters, such as whether she needs help transporting her luggage for a trip or whether she’s eaten. “He’s quite patriarchal; he’s very male-orientated,” she said, which she attributes in part to South Korean culture. She told me that their differences can lead to “cultural clashes”—a feeling many immigrant daughters may relate to.

Glennon told me that the dads he spoke with also felt disconnected from their adult daughters. He believes women cope with the lack of depth by brushing their father off—saying, “No, I can’t talk, I’ve got things to do.” That can leave dads confused and hurt, fueling the cycle.

For Nielsen, dad-daughter tension has an obvious solution: more quality time together. She acknowledged that communication styles can differ by gender, but she emphasized that, regardless of those differences, the more attention fathers and daughters devote to each other, the better the bond tends to be.

More fathers do seem to be changing their lifestyle to make time for their kids, daughters included. Modern dads, on average, do three times more child care than fathers in 1965 did. Some are fighting for better joint-custody laws. A growing number are forgoing paid work to stay at home. Nielsen told me that men are no less instinctively nurturing or empathetic than women; many lament the time they spend away from their kids.

Several of the daughters I spoke with were also carving out time for their father. They told me about planning annual daughter-dad road trips and going to counseling together. Shadi Shahnavaz, who has led several fathers and adult daughters in joint therapy sessions, told me that, in her experience, theirs are some of the quickest relationships to remedy.

Even between daughters and fathers whose dynamic has become intensely strained, Nielsen has argued that relationships can—and do—recover. For Melissa Shultz, healing came posthumously. In the decades since her father’s death, her anger toward him has softened. She still mourns what she “never had,” she told me, but she has come to empathize with him. “He had a lot of pain as a child, with his parents.”

For Joshua Coleman, who spent years estranged from his adult daughter, reconciliation came sooner. To rebuild trust, he told me, he learned to stop defending himself; he came to understand that demanding that his daughter respect his authority only drove her away. He saw a need to become more egalitarian and “soft.” When she was open to seeing him again, he let her set the pace. Slowly, he says, they found their way, not just to civility, but to something rarer: genuine closeness.

        <hr/>
        The board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts voted Thursday to rename the facility after both the former president and President Donald Trump.

“The Kennedy Center Board of Trustees voted unanimously today to name the institution The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts,” spokeswoman Roma Daravi said in a statement, adding that the name honors Trump’s work at the center since taking over early in his second term.

The move quickly raised legal concerns as to whether the board has the authority to rename the arts institution, which Congress designated in 1964 as a memorial to the Democratic president, and met backlash from the Kennedy family.

Trump, who was elected chair by a newly constituted board in February, has frequently joked about calling the performing arts center the “Trump Kennedy Center.” The president’s handpicked board approved his wishes at Thursday’s board meeting, according to a source familiar with the matter, during which Trump also called in.

At an Oval Office event later in the day, Trump said he was “honored” and “surprised” by the vote.

“This was brought up by one of the very distinguished board members, and they voted on it, and there’s a lot of board members, and they voted unanimously,” he said.

By Thursday afternoon, the center’s website header was updated to read “The Trump Kennedy Center.”

“Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X. “The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur.”

While the White House said the vote was unanimous, Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty, an ex-officio member of the board, said that was not the case.

“I was on that call and as I tried to push my button to voice my concern, to ask questions, and certainly not to vote in support of this, I was muted. Each time I tried to speak, I was muted,” she said in a video posted to X.

Legality concerns and Kennedy family pushback

Questions remain, however, about the legality of the board’s move to rename the building, and members of the Kennedy family condemned the effort on Thursday.

“The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law,” Joe Kennedy III, a former congressman and the great-nephew of the late president, said on X. “It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says.

Jack Schlossberg, a Kennedy grandson currently running for the US House in New York, also expressed concerns on social media with reports of muting during the vote.

Congress renamed the arts center after former President John F. Kennedy in legislation passed after his 1963 assassination, and federal law requires that the board “assure that after December 2, 1983, no additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.”

Experts told CNN that while the board’s decision Thursday was likely unlawful, it’s unclear whether someone looking to challenge the move would have the legal right – known as “standing” – to even pursue such a case.

“There is absolutely no way they can do this legally,” said David Super, a professor at Georgetown Law who specializes in legislation. But, he added, “the administration is not concerning itself with laws unless it has a realistic prospect of getting sued.”

Super said it’s possible that an employee of the center could try to bring a case challenging the renaming by pointing to a “reputational harm” that stems from having to put the new name on their resume, which they may claim has the potential to confuse prospective employers.

“I would not be optimistic that a court would accept that case,” he said.

The same goes for descendants of the late 35th president, Super told CNN. “If he were living, then he probably could sue, but I don’t think it’s clear that his heirs would have any right to sue on his behalf,” he said.

Maria Shriver, Kennedy’s niece, called the effort to rename the memorial after Trump “beyond comprehension” as she spoke of her uncle’s efforts to support the arts.

“He was a man who was interested in the arts, interested in culture, interested in education, language, history. He brought the arts into the White House, and he and my Aunt Jackie amplified the arts, celebrated the arts, stood up for the arts and artists,” she said in a post on X. “It is beyond comprehension that this sitting president has sought to rename this great memorial dedicated to President Kennedy.”

Inside Trump’s transformation of the arts center

Thursday’s vote marks the latest effort to leave Trump’s mark on the Kennedy Center.

Days after returning to office, Trump announced an aggressive plan to gut the existing board of trustees and oust its chairman, the billionaire philanthropist David Rubenstein. Since then, he’s led an effort to reshape the institution to his taste: reshaping its leadership, securing multimillion-dollar congressional funding for renovations, and reimagining its programming.

He installed a who’s who of loyalists — including new president Richard Grenell, his ambassador to Germany during his first term, who’s been reevaluating programming and targeting it “for the masses.” Grenell has cut the existing staff, hired political allies and mandated a “break-even policy” for every performance and facility rental.

Trump has also touted restoration of the building’s exterior marble, the interior chairs and “fully” renovated stages, which he says will be complete within a year.

The changes extend to what’s onstage too, as the president has sought to enact a “Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture,” saying the “Trump Kennedy Center” is “not going to be woke.”

Trump’s impact on the institution was evident earlier this month at the 2025 Kennedy Center Honors. The president has said he was “98%” involved” in picking the awardees, who ranged from Sylvester Stallone to the rock band KISS and Gloria Gaynor, among others.

Trump on Thursday said that under his administration the center has seen “record-setting numbers” in donors and previewed plans to get Congress to invest more money in the center.

“We’re saving the building. We saved the building. The building was in such bad shape, both physically, financially and every other way. And now it’s very solid, very strong,” he said.

This story has been updated with additional developments.

        Updated at 2:57 p.m. ET on February 2, 2026

Hundreds of billions of dollars have been poured into the AI industry in pursuit of a loosely defined goal: artificial general intelligence, a system powerful enough to perform at least as well as a human at any task that involves thinking. Will this be the year it finally arrives?

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and xAI CEO Elon Musk think so. Both have said that such a system could go online by the end of 2026, bringing, perhaps, cancer cures or novel bioweapons. (Amodei says he prefers the term powerful AI to AGI, because the latter is overhyped.) But wait: Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis says we might wait another decade for AGI. And—hold on—OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in an interview last month that “AGI kind of went whooshing by” already; that now he’s focused instead on “superintelligence,” which he defines as an AI system that can do better at specific, highly demanding jobs (“being president of the United States” or “CEO of a major company”) than any person could, even if that person were aided by AI themselves. To make matters even more confusing, just this past week, chatbots began communicating with one another via an AI “social network” called Moltbook, which Musk has likened to the beginnings of the singularity.

What the differences in opinion should serve to illustrate is exactly how squishy the notions of AGI, or powerful AI, or superintelligence really are. Developing a “general” intelligence was a core reason DeepMind, OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI were founded. And not even two years ago, these CEOs had fairly similar forecasts that AGI would arrive by the late 2020s. Now the consensus is gone: Not only are the timelines scattered, but the broad agreement on what AGI even is and the immediate value it could provide humanity has been scrubbed away.

The idea of a generally intelligent computer program first arose in the mid-20th century as a very distant goal for the then-nascent field of AI. It has always been a shaky idea. For instance, Alan Turing proposed his famous Turing Test in 1950 as a proxy for machine intelligence: He argued that if a machine could convince a human that they were talking with another person, then it would be displaying, or at least imitating, the equivalent of some sort of “thinking.” But the test has been passed a number of times by programs that nobody would call intelligent—they just happened to be convincing, to some humans, on this particular benchmark. In the early 2000s, the computer scientist Shane Legg, among others, helped establish the modern notion of AGI not as a threshold so much as a field of study—the study of generally intelligent algorithms, as opposed to narrow and targeted ones. There was never agreement on specific ways to test the presence of such general abilities in a machine. Even human intelligence itself is capacious and not well understood.

Yet the AI industry coalesced around the notion of AGI anyway—in large part because OpenAI, which kicked off today’s boom with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, has the goal of ensuring that AGI “benefits all of humanity” in its founding mission. At the time, it communicated about the concept constantly. (Ilya Sutskever, then the company’s chief scientist, had a habit of encouraging employees to “feel the AGI.”) The term’s ambiguity has been a boon for OpenAI and other firms that have been able to market “intelligence” without actually describing it in any meaningful way—hence the endless stream of questionable advertisements insisting that chatbots make ideal travel agents. Meanwhile, these companies have raised tremendous capital by showing the world that AI is getting better, and better at more things. As long as that seemed true—that their chatbots were progressing toward something—it was simple enough to argue that the ultimate destination was an all-powerful machine.

This case is getting harder to make. Large language models already exhibit impressive capabilities, especially in technical areas such as software engineering and solving competition-style math problems. But at the same time, AI models continue to struggle with seemingly trivial tasks, such as drawing clocks and completing simple logic puzzles. For much of last year, each new generation of bots yielded only marginal improvements, rather than leaps forward, on standard benchmarks. And those benchmarks are highly gameable: It is unclear whether AI labs are really measuring general capabilities at all, or just preparing their products for the right tests. Consider that a human chess grandmaster might lack street smarts, and that a literary theorist might struggle with algebra. The biggest improvements have come from so-called “agentic” frameworks that allow AI models to use other programs—write emails, search the web, deploy code—which make chatbots more useful and capable, but not necessarily “smarter.” That’s what Moltbook comes down to, ultimately: not AGI, but AI that can post to a social network.

As impressive as they can be, chatbots are now a “normal technology,” as the AI researchers Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor have put it: an invention that will spread across society and change it in real but gradual ways—like other new products that people pay for and benefit from using. This is becoming conventional wisdom. The White House AI adviser Sriram Krishnan recently described AI as a “very useful technology” that “has nothing to do with ‘general intelligence.’” Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, has described AI as “a tool” and said that his benchmark for the technology’s success is not building AGI but achieving 10 percent global GDP growth.

Even the AI labs and start-ups are starting to lean toward an open embrace of old-fashioned product development. Around San Francisco, billboards advertise AI accounting tools while founders pitch AI agents that will streamline back-office workflows and SOC-2 paperwork. Google DeepMind touted how its latest model, Gemini 3, can improve your “shopping experience” and organize your inbox. Both OpenAI and Anthropic have bragged about how their bots make corporate employees more efficient in such exciting areas as “writing sales emails.” OpenAI kicked off this year by announcing that it was going to begin rolling out ads in ChatGPT, and its CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, recently wrote on her Substack that the winning AI company will be that which turns “frontier research into products.” Indeed, OpenAI has released a web browser, social-media apps, and many other AI products and features over the past several months. (OpenAI has a corporate partnership with The Atlantic.)

These product launches reflect another relevant dynamic: The major AI models are all converging on roughly the same capabilities, so firms need to carve out distinct identities based on how they’re weaving those models into various tools and services. OpenAI has all of those apps. Anthropic has Claude Code, a tool that caters to developers, and is now testing a version of the product, Claude Cowork, for everyday white-collar jobs. And xAI’s Grok isn’t just a chatbot; it’s a service that interacts with users on X. This also helps explain why their rhetoric on AGI—or powerful AI, or superintelligence—is moving in different directions as well.

At a moment when its technical lead has evaporated, OpenAI is asserting that it’s not prioritizing technical research anyway—that the company is now focused on products to help people appreciate the benefits of the AGI that’s apparently already here. (Mark Chen, OpenAI’s chief research officer, told me that pairing “long-term, foundational research” with “real-world deployment strengthens our science by accelerating feedback.”) Meanwhile, Amodei continuing to maintain that powerful AI is right around the corner bolsters Anthropic’s reputation as stern, responsible, and anxious—a key selling point for his enterprise customers.

Hassabis’s longer prediction for the coming of AGI reflects the reality that DeepMind is just one component of Google—drawing from an enormous revenue stream so it can plod along while releasing AI features as they are ready. (This is akin to how the Google X lab spent years working on autonomous driving before publicly launching Waymo.) “I don’t think AGI should be turned into a marketing term for commercial gain,” Hassabis said in an interview on Thursday.

As for xAI: Musk has built a career on making grand promises and then delivering them far behind schedule, and AI seems to be his new fixation. Just this week, he announced that Tesla—the main source of his wealth—is abandoning some of its major car lines in order to produce humanoid robots, accelerating the firm’s pivot from car manufacturer to AI company. Tesla also recently said that it would invest $2 billion in xAI, and Musk is reportedly considering merging SpaceX with xAI. As Musk’s entire empire converges on intelligent machines, ratcheting up hype and expectations around the technology has become his standard playbook.

        <hr/>
        Lawyers for Fulton County, Georgia, are planning to file a lawsuit in federal court Monday against the FBI and the Justice Department over a search warrant that the FBI executed at an election hub last week seeking records related to the 2020 presidential election.

Fulton County Commissioner Marvin Arrington Jr. announced in a news release that the county plans to file a motion in the Northern District of Georgia challenging "the legality of the warrant and the seizure of sensitive election records, and force the government to return the ballots taken."

“I’ve asked the county attorney to take any and all steps available to fight this criminal search warrant,” Arrington said in a statement. “The search warrant, I believe, is not proper, but I think that there are ways that we can limit it. We want to ask for forensic accounting, we want the documents to stay in the State of Georgia under seal, and we want to do whatever we can to protect voter information.”

According to the announcement, FBI agents seized hundreds of boxes of ballots, ballot images and voter rolls under the search warrant. Arrington said in his statement that a separate court order had allowed the FBI only to copy records.

“They got copies of our voter rolls and all the original ballots,” Arrington said. “Now we cannot verify that we’ve received everything back because there was no chain-of-custody inventory taken at the time the records were seized.”

When contacted by NBC News, the FBI said it does not comment on potential or ongoing litigation.

The search warrant was executed Wednesday at the Fulton County election hub. The FBI’s Atlanta field office previously confirmed the activity and said an “investigation into this matter is ongoing so there are no details that we can provide at the moment.” The chair of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, Robb Pitts, said last week that he didn't know where the records were being taken.

Asked about the FBI’s seizure of the records, Director Kash Patel said in an interview on Fox News last week, “The FBI and the DOJ went in and collected numerous pieces of evidence that the judge authorized us to collect, and what we’re going to do next is go through the voluminous amounts of information collected and continue our investigation. At this point, there’s not much more I can say publicly.”

President Donald Trump lost Georgia in the 2020 election, which he has continued to claim was stolen from him. Georgia was among a number of states in which Trump tried to overturn the election results.

        <hr/>
        This month, an international team of scientists has been trying to set up sensors on and around Thwaites Glacier, one of the most unstable in the world. It’s often called Antarctica’s “doomsday glacier” because, if it collapses, it would add two feet of sea-level rise to the world’s oceans. On Thwaites itself, part of the team will try today to drop a fiber-optic cable through a 3,200-foot borehole in the ice, near the glacier’s grounding line, where the ocean is eating away at it from below. Sometime in the next week, another part of the team, working from the South Korean icebreaker RV Araon, aims to drop another cable, which a robot will traverse once a day, down to a rocky moraine in the Amundsen Sea. The data the sensors gather over the next two years will fill gaps in basic scientific knowledge about Thawaites. They will also determine the future of an audacious idea to slow its demise.

Right now, warm water is barely cresting the moraine, then flowing down a seabed canyon toward the glacier. If this natural dam were a little taller, it could block those warm ocean currents. Using the data on current speeds and water temperatures, scientists and engineers will model whether a giant curtain atop the moraine could divert warm water away from the glacier’s base—and if it would even be possible to construct one.

To avert catastrophe in this way would be a massive undertaking: The curtain itself would need to be up to 500 feet tall and 50 miles long. But these local conditions are in such tentative balance—“on a knife’s edge,” David Holland, a climate scientist at NYU and a member of the Seabed Curtain Project, told me from the deck of the RV Araon—that Holland and some other scientists believe that an intervention could change the glacier’s fate. Of his colleagues on the boat, he may be the only one thinking along those lines right now, he said. “But everyone’s data is going to be used by people for years and years for that purpose.”

A few years ago, the curtain project was a fringe idea that John Moore, a glaciologist at the University of Lapland, and a couple of like-minded colleagues had proposed in a series of academic articles. This kind of geoengineering, meant to address the symptoms of climate change without slowing it down, was a bête noire in the glaciology community. Now more scientists are coming to see targeted interventions in our climate as inevitable. The curtain project and at least one competing idea for slowing Thwaites’s melt have raised millions of dollars—not just from the usual geoengineering proponents but from traditional philanthropic foundations.

“The idea that there’s a clean exit on climate change, people need to get over that,” Holland said, before he set out on the icebreaker. “What is the least brutal outcome for the world is what will be decided.”

Geoengineering—which could also include removing carbon dioxide from the ocean and using stratospheric aerosol injection to dim the sun—is gaining adherents in part because decarbonization simply isn’t proceeding quickly enough. This past fall, the United Nations announced that within the next decade, global temperatures will likely rise by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, a threshold that the Paris Agreement aimed to avoid. At the same time, climate impacts are getting real—droughts are supercharging fire seasons; hotter seas are intensifying hurricanes.

Marianne Hagen, a former Norwegian deputy minister of foreign affairs, told me that she’d long considered geoengineering “science fiction and just something not worth spending a lot of time on.” Then she watched as the Ukraine war changed the conversations around her: Energy security came to the forefront of European politics, and “nobody talked about energy transition anymore.” She thought of the vulnerable coastal nations she’d visited as a government official and, in 2024, signed on to co-lead the curtain project with Moore. “I ended up in John’s camp, mostly out of despair, because I could not see a safe pathway forward for future generations without doing the necessary research on these Band-Aid, buy-time solutions,” she said.

After that, the project quickly raised initial research funding from the nonprofits Outlier Projects, run by a former Meta executive, and the Tom Wilhelmsen Foundation, founded by a prominent Norwegian shipping company. Although government agencies in the United States and United Kingdom have funded lab research on geoengineering, rich patrons have been comparably powerful funders of geoengineering in general—and the primary funders of polar-geoengineering research. “There are lots of people with lots of money, and it’s in the scale of the private sector to do this,” Holland told me.

Another group, the Arête Glacier Initiative, is investigating the idea of refreezing Thwaites to bedrock by pumping lubricating meltwater out from its base or drawing heat away with passive heat pumps. An initiative called Real Ice is trying to pump seawater atop Arctic sea ice to thicken it. “We’ve found a lot of enthusiasm among the philanthropic community” for targeted geoengineering interventions that could limit damage to coastal communities, Brent Minchew, a geophysicist at Caltech and a co-founder of Arête, told me. “These are very localized interventions for global benefits.”

Scientists agree that, absent intervention, Thwaites’s retreat will accelerate within the next century and the glacier will eventually collapse. And Thwaites acts as a cork in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which contains enough water to raise sea levels by nearly 17 feet. The price of localized interventions at Thwaites, proponents say, pales in comparison with the price of building seawalls around major cities. In one paper, Moore and two colleagues estimated that the curtain could cost $40 billion to $80 billion to install (and $1 billion to $2 billion a year to maintain), whereas adapting to rising sea levels could cost an estimated $40 billion a year. One way or another, we are going to have to build in order to fight the sea.

But many in the science community still disagree, vehemently, both with geoengineering proposals and with the rationale for considering them at all. In a prominent paper published in the fall, the University of Exeter polar glaciologist Martin Siegert and 41 co-authors explained in detail how the curtain project, the type of refreezing that Arête wants to try, sea-ice thickening, and two other polar-geoengineering proposals would be too expensive, technically impossible, and potentially damaging to fragile ecosystems. The paper also raised a common argument against geoengineering—that pursuing these ideas is a dangerous distraction from decarbonization, the best solution to climate change.

Siegert decided to write the paper, he told me, after he was the sole dissenter at a talk on sea-ice thickening at the UN’s climate conference in 2023. He was shocked how mainstream the once-fringe field had become. To him, these ideas are so far from feasible, they offer a false hope that distracts from the necessary work of cutting back on fossil-fuel use to avoid catastrophe. Ted Scambos, a glaciologist who co-led the major U.S.-U.K. collaboration that studied the mechanisms driving Thwaites’s retreat, told me that he was once tentatively supportive of geoengineering research but, given that the Trump administration has slashed funding for climate science and renewable-energy development, is now strongly against it. “We absolutely should not fund or support efforts, or even tests, of climate or ice loss mitigation methods,” he wrote in an email. “It should be a matter of international law, and it should be set up as such immediately.” Instead, research and policies should “remain laser-focused on reducing fossil fuel use” and on minimizing the related economic impacts.

Those working on geoengineering research see opponents as equally shortsighted. Merely documenting changes to the cryosphere is like “choosing the best seat on the Titanic to listen to the last tune of the orchestra as the ship goes down,” Moore said. Studying geoengineering interventions is like “launching a few lifeboats.” At this point, decarbonization, even if it happened tomorrow, would not necessarily save Thwaites from collapse, he argued. “To decarbonize to the point at which we will be keeping the glaciers safe, you require actual magic to do that. It is delusional.”

Some proponents of projects like the sea curtain argue that they’re not a novel class of environmental action. They are an act of preservation not dissimilar from redirecting rivers and rebuilding beaches. Letting Thwaites collapse arguably violates the Antarctic Treaty System’s environmental-preservation clause, Minchew said.

How far we’re willing to go to keep the cryosphere in a recognizable shape while the world works on decarbonization is an open question. To geoengineering proponents, persuading the 29 member nations of the Antarctic Treaty with decision-making power to try to build a sea curtain looks easier than persuading the 193 members of the United Nations to, say, try seeding the atmosphere with sun-blocking chemicals. Opponents worry about breaking existing environmental protections for the region, and endangering the treaty altogether. But Holland, at least, is willing to predict the outcome of these debates.

“Fast-forward 1,000 years, the Earth will be geoengineered,” he said. “The entire climate will be regulated like a modern house—no question.” The climate may get screwed up in new ways as scientists attempt to turn the planet’s temperature dial down. But “if it survives, humanity is simply going to do this.”

Destruction is easier than construction. If Donald Trump’s decades as a real-estate developer didn’t teach him that, his time as president might.

In October, the administration bulldozed the East Wing of the White House in order to build a ballroom he wants to put on the site. Although Trump had promised over the summer that the project wouldn’t “interfere with the current building,” workers razed the entire structure, which was constructed in 1902 and expanded in 1942. Trump managed this the same way he has so much in his second term: He simply didn’t ask permission from any of the possible relevant authorities, including Congress, and acted so fast that no court could restrain him. In order to circumvent the legislature’s power of the purse, he sought donations from private corporations and individuals.

The demolition was hardly the most egregious action that Trump has taken as president, but it captured popular and media attention because it was such a clear metaphor: Trump had secretively demolished part of a building that belongs to the people of the United States, treating it as his own. That metaphor may become more potent yet. Recent events suggest that the gaping hole where the East Wing once was may lie there exposed, undeveloped, and contested for quite some time.

In a court hearing last week, Richard Leon, a federal judge appointed by George W. Bush, skewered the government lawyers representing the administration against a challenge to the ballroom, which would be as tall as the original executive mansion and have nearly double its footprint. Although a law enables the executive branch to conduct maintenance on the building without congressional authorization, Leon said it was not intended to cover $400 million projects. A Justice Department attorney suggested that Trump’s ballroom was similar to previous renovations, including a pool added decades ago, but Leon was not having it.

“The Gerald Ford swimming pool? You compare that to ripping down the East Wing and building a new East Wing? Come on,” he said.

Such reactions from a judge are not generally considered a favorable omen for a litigant. Leon has not issued a ruling yet, and whatever he concludes is likely to be appealed. But the hearing suggests the real possibility that Trump will be unable to construct anything in the East Wing’s place, leaving just an empty site and idled construction equipment.

Destruction followed by stagnation seems to be something of an MO, the likely outcome for some of Trump’s less tangible and visible changes to the federal government. Consider last week’s clash over Greenland. Trump threatened European and Canadian leaders with tariffs and unspecified future consequences, culminating in Trump settling for a tentative deal that appears to closely resemble the existing arrangement, but not before creating bad blood and encouraging Europe to think of the U.S. as not much of a friend. Trump has the capacity to tear down the global international order, but he has neither the plans nor the wherewithal to rebuild anything in its place.

Similarly, DOGE found it relatively easy to destroy USAID, but the administration hasn’t been able to create any new way of extending soft power around the globe. Leveling threats of tariffs on adversaries and allies alike has been relatively easy, but the result has been a weakening of the economy and American trade ties, and a crumbling of the old global-trade system. He has been unable to bring a huge boom of manufacturing jobs and factories to U.S. shores.

Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement has deported so many people, led so many people to leave the country, and discouraged so many people from coming that U.S. population growth slowed dramatically between June 2024, near the end of the Biden administration, and July 2025, according to numbers released this week by the Census Bureau. Yet the right’s hope for pronatalist policies that would try to drive up birth rates have amounted to little. Reduced population growth—or a sinking population, should it come to that—threatens economic growth.

Trump no longer talks about fully repealing the Affordable Care Act; he and Republicans have now adopted a strategy of slowly bleeding the program. The GOP-controlled Congress allowed subsidies to lapse at the end of 2025, helping produce a big drop in the number of people insured under the ACA. But despite offering “concepts of a plan” during the presidential campaign, and rolling out a “Great Healthcare Plan” this month, experts say Trump still hasn’t put together anything resembling a real blueprint for improving health insurance. Meanwhile, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. seems to be having much more luck undermining the existing institutions and practices of American public health than remaking the nation’s practices in his idiosyncratic image.

Even if these things are ultimately achieved, the difficulty and cost of doing so is likely to be much greater than Trump has promised to voters. The same is true of the ballroom project. The president first said it would cost $200 million. By October, the price tag had risen to $300 million. In December, the administration quoted a $400 million figure. Anyone can guess what the final bill might be if the ballroom is ever built, but given the private funding, each jump in the cost creates new opportunities for donors to buy influence from the president.

Some Democrats have said that any new president who replaces Trump should move promptly to tear down his ballroom. If the project never moves forward, though, they’ll have no need. Perhaps they could instead leave the empty site, a fitting monument to the Trump presidency.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Australia's implementation of a social-media ban for children under 16 serves as a pioneering experiment in digital regulation. Drawing parallels to age-restricted goods like alcohol and tobacco, the article argues that while compliance may be imperfect, such prohibitions historically succeed in reducing usage and protecting adolescents during critical stages of neurodevelopment.

        <hr/>
        Australia recently decided to try something ambitious. Starting late last year, all children under 16 have been banned from having accounts on social-media sites such as TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. Because no country has attempted such a ban before, knowing the effects in advance is impossible—and they may be hard to assess even years after implementation.

That said, the long experience of governments trying to restrict young people’s access to temptation goods of other kinds—drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, pornography—justifies cautious optimism. The ban might deliver some truly valuable benefits, letting youthful missteps remain local and ephemeral, rather than searing permanent brands onto developing psyches, and giving young people more time to develop the in-person social skills and connections that make life meaningful.

Before we dive into details, we must address two reflexive, skeptical views of social-media bans. The first is that no matter how cleverly designed or strict a ban is, some kids will figure out ways around it, and thus the ban serves no purpose. By that logic, countries should abandon bans on robbery, toxic dumping, and corporate malfeasance, none of which is ever 100 percent foolproof. Already some Australian teens may have downloaded VPN software to get around the ban—but perfectionism should not be the enemy of progress.

The second mistake is to think that all prohibitions look like the much-maligned War on Drugs, which many view as responsible for exacerbating incarceration, poverty, and violence. A social-media ban is not like the War on Drugs. Governments ban all sorts of goods and services for youth, adults, or both, and most prohibitions do not create other devastating social problems. Violations of the Australian ban would lead to fines on corporations, not kids being sent to detention centers.

But the core lesson from other bans is that most of them produce the intended effects, reducing the activity they seek to stem. For example, fireworks-related injuries tended to be much lower in states whose fireworks laws were more restrictive, but later rose in the many states that relaxed their laws in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Perhaps the most revealing analogues are the widespread age restrictions for the purchase and consumption of tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis, which are common around the world and have been extensively studied.

Yes, compliance will be imperfect. Data from the CDC show that in the past month, 4 percent of high-school students smoked a cigarette, 17 percent used marijuana, 17 percent vaped, and 22 percent drank alcohol, despite being underage. Thanks to older siblings and friends, permissive parents, fake IDs, and unethical sellers, some young people have always found ways to evade these bans, and similar tactics could work for surmounting a social-media ban as well. Yet all of these behaviors are still far more prevalent among adults, and there is a marked increase in uptake right as young people cross the legal threshold, an indication of the bans’ real impact.

Other studies suggest that even partially effective bans can reduce underage substance use and lead to other positive outcomes. Researchers exploited the staggered rollout of new state laws that increased the drinking age from 18 to 21 over the course of the 1980s to determine that although many people ages 18 to 20 evaded the ban, raising the legal age for drinking reduced alcohol consumption and traffic crashes among that group. A subsequent review was even more decisive, pronouncing the debate over the ban’s effects “closed.” Similar policies raised the minimum legal age for purchasing tobacco to 21 in the late 2010s, and had similar effects.

Adolescence is a time of high neuroplasticity in which many lifelong habits, good and bad, are formed. This is why companies pay a premium to advertise their products on TV shows that attract young viewers, and it is also why social-media companies see Australia’s ban as a long-term economic threat. People are generally far less likely to become addicted to something if they are introduced to it after their brain is fully developed (at about age 25), and every year of adolescence that someone delays using an addictive product, their risk of developing problems with it drops. Researchers have shown that growing up in a state and time after the drinking age was raised predicted decreased binge-drinking episodes in a sample of men as old as 53.

Positive outcomes from raising the minimum legal age for addictive substances do not guarantee success for imposing minimum legal ages on social-media accounts. Consuming alcohol, tobacco, or cannabis requires the acquisition of a physical object. This creates regulatory checkpoints (for instance, mandatory ID checks) that are hard to replicate online. Parents, teachers, and other adults who work with young people may have an easier time detecting these substances (smelling smoke; noticing that someone is drunk) than detecting whether someone is illegally using Instagram.

However, in other respects, banning access to social media may be easier. Many teens appear to want to be off social media; they see it as detrimental to their own well-being but nevertheless feel they have to be on it to keep up with their peers. Fascinating economic research has shown that many social-media users would pay money to avoid a break from social media while others continue using it, but many of those same users would pay money to have the entire network deactivated for everyone.

A ban might solve this collective-action problem, just as banning steroids in sporting competitions spares athletes from feeling compelled to damage their bodies just to keep up with competitors who dope. Young people can look at pornography alone (and presumably would generally prefer to), but social media is a lot less enticing if people you know are banned from using it. A ban thus can make using social media less rewarding in a way that is not true of pornography: As your peers reduce or stop their use, your incentive to do the same increases, in a mutually reinforcing cycle.

A final significant question is whether the ban is politically sustainable. Cannabis prohibition was the law of the land in America until it wasn’t, brought down by an unusual combination of deep-pocketed corporate interests and left-leaning anti-corporate people who objected to punishing users (especially disadvantaged groups) for violating the ban. The social-media ban already has corporate opponents, including some of the world’s most influential companies. But because the ban penalizes corporations, not consumers who break the rules, ban-repeal advocates may have a harder time drawing a coalition of cross-partisan support.

Policies are rarely purely good, and the ban is likely to result in trade-offs. A few years from now, we may learn, for example, that rural Australian youth report feeling more isolated, but reading scores in junior high are rising nationally. Or we may find that participation in youth sports grows but so does compulsive computer gaming. Australia’s voters will have to assess what trade-offs they find reasonable. Regardless of how they choose, they will have done other countries a service by being the first mover as the world contends with how to live with such powerful new technologies.

        <hr/>
        The state and local officials meeting with Tom Homan, who was put in charge of the federal immigration operation in Minnesota this week, have generally agreed that their encounters have been cordial and productive, a welcome change from the militaristic approach taken by his predecessor. Homan has also cast these discussions in a positive light, expressing optimism Thursday that “commonsense cooperation” on immigration enforcement in Minneapolis will allow him to draw down the thousands of agents that have flooded the city for the past two months.

But beyond the pleasantries, Homan is finding little appetite in Minnesota for the kind of targeted, aggressive immigration enforcement he has long sought to enact in Democratic-run cities and states. After the shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents, there is even less trust among local leaders that the Trump administration can be a reliable partner.

Although Homan has acknowledged that the immigration surge in Minnesota has not “been perfect,” his upbeat predictions of a smooth and swift détente seem to underestimate how much ill will the Trump administration’s actions have caused among the state’s politicians, activists, and residents. The killings of Good and Pretti-–each followed by a Trump-administration push to denigrate the victims and box out local investigators-–came against a backdrop of growing mistrust and frustration even among officials who have typically embraced partnership with their federal partners.

“One of the things that was exceedingly frustrating was the fact that they were putting out information that was just utterly and completely untrue,” Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told me.

Schnell met with Homan this week. The prison-systems leader told me that his agency felt it had no choice but to take the extraordinary step of creating a webpage to fact-check several statements made by the Department of Homeland Security, which claimed that the state was routinely releasing violent criminals onto the street.

Several of the convicted criminals DHS claimed it had “arrested” in Minnesota had actually been in his department’s custody when they were handed over to federal officials, Schnell said. These transfers, which took place without fanfare inside state prisons, belied the administration’s argument that it had sent 3,000 agents into Minnesota to hunt down criminals because it was not receiving cooperation from local officials. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Homan acknowledged that the Department of Corrections had been honoring ICE detainers—requests from the federal government for information about inmates who may be subject to immigration removal proceedings.

The broader challenge for the Trump administration is that focusing on the kinds of violent criminals DHS has called “the worst of the worst” won’t produce the mass-deportation numbers that Trump has demanded. Schnell told me that he could find no justification for the administration’s claim that there were more than 1,360 inmates with ICE detainers in Minnesota. He said his office repeatedly sought clarity from DHS about the figure but received no answer, eventually opting to launch the webpage, which is titled “Combatting DHS Misinformation.” Schnell told me that the state prison system has only about 270 noncitizen inmates, or less than 3 percent of its total population of about 8,000. The large deployment of immigration officers to Minneapolis never made sense if the goal was to target violent criminals, he said.

“You’re talking about the worst of the worst; and then you send your 3,000 agents into schools and hospitals and churches and small businesses?” Schnell said. “Is that really where the worst of the worst are at?”

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. The White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told me the administration’s conversations with local officials were ongoing. “The Trump Administration remains committed to enforcing federal laws and ensuring all Americans feel safe in their communities,” she said by email. “Local leaders should work with us, not against us, to achieve this goal.”

Homan, the administration’s “border czar,” arrived in Minnesota this week and took the reins from Greg Bovino, the ousted Border Patrol commander. He said Thursday that federal immigration agents in the state will prioritize arresting violent criminals, while acknowledging that the operation—which has swept up refugees, children, and U.S. citizens with no criminal records—had “got away from” its core mission.

Police in Minnesota have said they support the removal of violent criminals from the community. But the federal government’s actions have soured relations in a way that, for some, makes future coordination on immigration enforcement unlikely, current and former officials told me. In addition to killing two Minnesota residents, masked federal agents have roughed up protesters and created a sense of fear in the community.

“Trust has been breached, and I don’t think you can get that back,” Lucy Gerold, who served as a police officer in Minneapolis for more than 30 years, told me. “I think they’ve lost the trust and breached the ability to compromise or coordinate or cooperate.”

Gerold said she unwittingly found herself in the midst of a federal immigration operation and was stunned by the lack of protocol and professionalism. Despite having shown up in six unmarked cars to make an arrest, the agents failed to secure the scene and control the flow of traffic. The mix of protesters, moving cars, and armed agents created chaos, she said. Although federal officials have said they want local police to help them perform such tasks more smoothly, the Minneapolis Police Department is reluctant to be associated with an operation that often appears disjointed, unprofessional, and hostile.

Days before Pretti was killed, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told me that it’s “potentially damaging to the legitimacy of law enforcement” for his officers to be seen cooperating with a federal operation that many residents view as an invasion. Homan’s desire for more support from local police faces other obstacles. The Minneapolis city council recently updated a rule spelling out the restrictions on how police can interact with federal immigration officers. Known as a “separation ordinance,” it says Minneapolis must “vigorously oppose” any efforts to use its resources to support federal immigration enforcement, asserting that community trust would be “destroyed” if local officials are seen collaborating with Trump’s mass-deportation teams.

“Enforcing federal civil immigration laws alongside federal agents who lack clear agency identification and/or who are masked or otherwise concealing their identities or badges would be contrary to the values of the city and harmful to the trust and public safety of city residents,” the ordinance reads.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz each said they had productive meetings with Homan, and appreciated the opportunity to discuss the situation with him. Still, they seemed more reluctant to cooperate with ICE or otherwise change their policy than Homan had suggested in his press conference.

“I’m not sure I can do much more,” the governor told my colleague Isaac Stanley-Becker this week, accusing the federal agents of engaging in unconstitutional profiling. Speaking to the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Thursday, Frey described the Trump administration’s actions as “an invasion on our democracy” and reiterated his stance that the federal operation needs to end immediately.

Hours after Homan told reporters that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison had “clarified” that county jails can tell the government when violent offenders are scheduled for release, Ellison released a lengthy statement asserting that his priority was bringing the federal surge to an end and investigating the deaths of Good and Pretti.

“We will not make any concessions or compromises to undermine our state sovereignty,” he wrote, adding that he “did not make, and could not have made, any agreement” with Homan about how county officials would interact with ICE.

The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, home to the state’s largest jail system, has a policy of not honoring ICE detainer requests. When I asked if Sheriff Dawanna Witt planned to revise that stance after meeting with Homan this week, the HCSO spokesperson Megan Larson was noncommittal. Jails have limited discretion, she told me, and any changes “must come through clear statewide policy direction and legislation.”

In an advisory opinion last year, Ellison wrote that local jails cannot legally hold inmates in custody at ICE’s request if they are otherwise eligible for release. Ellison said this week that he told Homan he stands by that opinion. He said he also reiterated Minnesota state law, which requires state and local authorities to contact ICE whenever a noncitizen is convicted of a felony.

Linus Chan, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and an immigration attorney, told me that although he does not know of a time when the state has not complied with that law, DHS is asking for deeper cooperation that would allow its agents to search local jails and deport people who have not been convicted or who are eligible for bail. Agreeing to such a policy would be a major misread of what Minnesotans—many of whom have taken to the streets to protest ICE—expect from their leaders, local activists told me.

With Trump’s poll numbers sliding and infighting and dysfunction plaguing the team behind the mass-deportation plan, some Minnesota residents say cutting a deal now would amount to an ill-timed surrender. Others are concerned that despite Homan’s charm offensive and promises to turn down the temperature, federal authorities have continued to comb through Minneapolis looking for people to arrest.

“Given how violent things have been and how awful the situation has gotten, people are not going to just immediately want to turn around and trust anything that is said by the federal government right now,” Julia Decker, the policy director for the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, told me.

The arrests of journalists and protesters this week by federal agents have further inflamed tensions. Meanwhile, local officials have been frustrated by DHS’s unwillingness to cooperate with their investigations into the shootings of Good and Pretti. (The Justice Department announced yesterday that it is opening an investigation into Pretti’s death.)

“The only time this situation will de-escalate is when the federal occupying force ends its siege,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said this week in a video message. “They are the escalating factor, and they have been this entire time.”

Trump may have the final say on where the federal operation goes from here. A day after saying he planned to “de-escalate a little bit,” Trump on Wednesday attacked Frey for saying the city would not enforce federal immigration law. The mayor, the president posted on social media, was “playing with fire.”

And hours after Homan pledged a significant reduction of forces from Minneapolis if local leaders agreed to work with him, Trump appeared to cast doubt on the more cooperative approach. While attending a premiere for First Lady Melania Trump’s documentary film, the president was asked whether he was planning to pull back in Minnesota.

“No, no, not at all,” he said.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Musician Yasmin Williams reported being heckled and intimidated by a group of Log Cabin Republicans during her performance at the Kennedy Center after she criticized the institution's board and president Richard Grenell.

        <hr/>
        Last week, on September 18, Yasmin Williams performed at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Despite having previously had a heated email exchange with Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell, Williams said that she felt it was important to play “the show for all the Kennedy Center staff who formed their own union and are still working there, fighting to maintain the institution’s integrity.”

During the concert, which took place at the Washington, D.C., center’s Millennium Stage, Williams was heckled by an organized group of Log Cabin Republicans, she said online. “During my Kennedy Center show on Thursday night, a group of Tr*mp supporters boo’d me when I mentioned Ric Grenell and seemed to be there to intimidate me,” Williams wrote on social media. She also shared screenshots of an apparent email sent out by Andrew Minik, the president of the group’s Washington, D.C., chapter, imploring members to “make sure the audience is filled with patriots!”

During her show, which is available to watch in full below, Williams reiterated her support for Kennedy Center staff and criticized the organization’s board of trustees, a group that was put together by President Donald J. Trump after he made himself the center’s new chairman.

“I do not support the new board at all; I don’t support anyone affiliated with them; I don’t support anyone affiliated with the Trump administration at all—especially you, Ric Grenell,” Williams said. “I am not a fan of yours at all.” Applause and boos can be heard in the video, too.

After the show, Williams wrote on social media that her “safety was threatened” and that security “escorted [her] to [her] car to keep [her] safe.” She also told Washingtonian about the apparent hecklers. “They booed and heckled me,” she said. “They tried to derail my concert, but fortunately they were outnumbered.”

In an email to The Washington Post, Kennedy Center spokesperson Roma Daravi disputed Williams’ claims about the organized efforts to disrupt her performance. “This is an absolutely ridiculous claim,” Daravi wrote. “There was no coordinated effort by the Kennedy Center. Grenell had no involvement. We did not even know they were coming.”

Daravi also claimed that Log Cabin Republican members “did not heckle and frankly it is defamation of character for her [Yasmin Williams] to say that—she however bashed Grenell and the Center from the Kennedy Center stage. Republicans are patrons too and they are welcome at the Kennedy Center just like anyone else.”

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Since Donald Trump's leadership takeover of the Kennedy Center in February, ticket sales for its major venues have significantly declined, with approximately 43 percent of seats remaining unsold for recent productions.

        <hr/>
        After President Donald Trump took over the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in February, he and the executive he put in charge repeatedly accused the institution’s former leadership of not doing the very thing they were responsible for: selling tickets.

“We had spent way too much on programming that doesn’t bring in any revenue,” Richard Grenell, a Trump ally and former ambassador to Germany, told the Washington Reporter, a conservative media outlet, in late March. According to Grenell, the center hadn’t been making money. It was too woke and niche. The new team was, in Trump’s words, going to make it “hot” again.

Nearly nine months after Trump became chair of the center and more than a month into its main season, ticket sales for the Kennedy Center’s three largest performance venues are the worst they’ve been in years, according to a Washington Post analysis of ticketing data from dozens of recent shows as well as past seasons. Tens of thousands of seats have been left empty.

Since early September, 43 percent of tickets remained unsold for the typical production. That means that, at most, 57 percent of tickets were sold for the typical production — and some tickets may have been “comps,” which are given away, often to staff members or the press. That compares with 93 percent sold or comped in fall 2024 and 80 percent in fall 2023.

The Post collected and analyzed ticket sales data from Sept. 3 to Oct. 19, which reveals an across-the-board drop-off in the center’s major theaters: the Opera House, the Concert Hall and the Eisenhower Theater. The performances included National Symphony Orchestra programs, touring Broadway musicals and dance performances.

The Kennedy Center did not respond to a request for comment.

Overall, the center could have sold tickets to roughly 143,000 seats during this time period. Of those, more than 50,000 remained vacant.

The Post also analyzed internal Kennedy Center sales figures from past years and credit and debit card transaction data, which underscores what patrons can see with their own eyes: Unfilled seats are now a regular feature of Washington’s national center for the performing arts.

According to the spending data, drawn from 40 million credit and debit cards analyzed by the consumer data and analytics company Consumer Edge, less than half as much money was spent on tickets in September and the first half of October 2025 as during that same period in 2024. This is less than people spent on the center during any other year since 2018, except 2020, when the venue was locked down for most of the year.

The drop in ticket buying may have broader consequences. Fewer patrons in chairs could lead to fewer donations, warned Michael Kaiser, who served from 2001 to 2014 as president of the Kennedy Center, where he boasted a budget surplus every year.

“Depressed ticket sales not only cause a shortfall in revenue; they also bode unfavorably for future fundraising revenue,” Kaiser wrote in an email after reviewing The Post’s findings. “The vast majority of donors are ticket buyers who are anxious to enhance their relationships with the organization by making contributions in addition to paying for their tickets. We had 40,000 generous individual donors by the time I left the Center in 2014. Funding from these individuals formed the foundation for all we accomplished.”

It is unclear what the Kennedy Center’s overall revenue picture looks like at the moment. The center has declined several requests from The Post to share concrete details about its financials. Ticket sales usually account for less than half of its revenue, according to the center’s publicly available tax returns from the past several years. The center also relies on corporate sponsorships, event rentals, philanthropic giving and other sources of income. Its building operations are funded by the federal government.

To compare the current sales to those of past seasons, The Post obtained internal “all-discipline” reports from the past several years. These share final ticket sales, revenue, attendance and more for all shows at the center from fall 2021 through the start of summer 2025. They used to be shared with all employees every Wednesday, but the new leadership ended the practice this summer.

An across-the-board drop-off

Despite Grenell’s critique of the former Kennedy Center management, swaths of empty seats were an unusual sight in the large venues before the takeover, according to The Post’s analysis.

From September to mid-October last year, on average, only 7 percent of seats were available for a typical production on the day of the performance. In 2023, 20 percent of seats were unsold. In 2022, a robust year for the center, only 6 percent of seats were available.

In 2021, as the center was reopening during the coronavirus pandemic, 34 percent of seats went unsold — a bit less than this year, when the median production had about 43 percent of seats available.

“Given the unprecedented takeover of a nonpartisan arts institution combined with the inexperience and rhetoric of the new management, I expected a decline in sales; however, it is truly shocking to see that these actions have been worse for business at the Kennedy Center than the aftermath of a global pandemic,” a former staff member said via messaging app, speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of professional blowback. “These numbers are likely more dire than they appear, as they don’t account for canceled productions or shows moved into smaller theaters due to weak ticket sales.”

There may be multiple reasons for the dip in ticket sales. On Broadway, musical theater sales are down, as the New York Times recently reported. The Trump administration’s recent National Guard deployment has hurt tourism and nightlife in Washington. And many former Kennedy Center patrons have pledged to boycott the institution until Trump is no longer chair.

“This downturn isn’t just about pricing or programming — it feels directly tied to the new regime’s leadership shift and the broader political climate,” said a current staff member, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. “I’ve heard from ticket buyers who say they’re choosing not to attend because of what the Kennedy Center now represents. The brand itself has become polarizing, which is unprecedented in my experience.”

Since 2018, in the same 45-day period The Post analyzed, only six shows had fewer than half of their seats filled. Five of them — all orchestra concerts — were this year. Among them was “The Legacy of John Williams and Steven Spielberg,” part of the National Symphony Orchestra’s Pops series, which typically brings in a broader audience.

During the concert, which one of this article’s reporters attended, the ushers repeatedly encouraged audience members to move up to more expensive seats, as much of the orchestra section was empty. The top two tiers, which were originally available for purchase, were closed several days before the three-performance run because of low ticket sales.

Even reliable shows are struggling

“We are doing the big things that people want to see,” Grenell recently said in an interview. “We are seeing a huge change because people are recognizing that they want to be a part of something that is common-sense programming,” he continued, employing a phrase he has often used while describing his plans for the Kennedy Center. (Grenell has repeatedly declined interview requests from The Post.)

The week after Trump announced his plans to take over the center, ticket sales dropped by 50 percent, several staff members said at the time. Months later, sales of subscriptions to the major seasons (theater, opera, etc.) were down by 36 percent, according to internal data obtained by The Post. And the numbers remain dismal.

What has changed under Trump and Grenell?

There has been an influx of Christian programming, but many of these events have been free to the public. Numerous programming executives have resigned or been dismissed, part of a broader trend of layoffs at the center. The programming of the theater and the National Symphony Orchestra, in particular, is similar to that of previous years. One major difference was a high-dollar fundraiser that Trump hosted to open the summer run of “Les Misérables.” Another is the numerous artists who have said they won’t perform there.

Some adjustments are evident. The center moved “Parade” — a Tony-winning musical that ran from Aug. 19 to Sept. 7 — from the 2,364-seat Opera House, where it was originally slated to run, to the 1,161-seat Eisenhower Theater. In the last few days of its run, 43 percent of seats were available.

“The Sound of Music,” which included 32 performances from Sept. 9 to Oct. 5, was a centerpiece of the fall schedule.

“This is a beloved classic for so many people, and exactly the type of popular show you can expect on our stages from the new leadership,” Roma Daravi, the Kennedy Center’s vice president of public relations, told the Washington Reporter.

Grenell agreed, telling the outlet, “We are trying to be financially responsible and give shows that are common sense, blockbuster hits with the public.”

But it wasn’t a hit. While some performances nearly sold out, on average about one-third of the seats were still for sale day-of.

A window into the Kennedy Center’s financial health

Grenell and other members of the center’s new leadership team have repeatedly claimed that the center was deep in debt and paying its employees from debt reserves, and have even accused the former leadership of fraud, which those leaders deny.

Shows selling this poorly leave more than $1 million in potential revenue on the table — just 45 days into the season.

Consider a recent run of the National Symphony Orchestra’s “An Evening of Beethoven.” For the three shows, more than 2,000 seats, worth about $110,000, were still available day-of, according to The Post’s analysis of listed prices on the Kennedy Center’s ticketing website on the morning before each performance.

About $330,000 worth of seats were filled, according to the listed prices — but it is unclear how many were comps, which do not generate revenue. Indeed, several Kennedy Center staff members told The Post they’ve received far more free tickets than in previous years. The center has on occasion offered hundreds of comp seats for shows to “paper the house,” or to make it look like ticket sales are higher than they actually are, according to one staff member with knowledge of ticketing, speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal. “All in all, it is not a sustainable situation,” this staff member said.

The blowback to Trump’s takeover already extends into next year. “Hamilton” probably would have been the center’s biggest show in 2026, but the producers pulled out this summer. Producer Jeffrey Seller said at the time that the show was incompatible with “a new spirit of partisanship … [at] the national treasure that is the Kennedy Center.”

“‘Hamilton’ was proudly performed at the Kennedy Center in 2018 during the first Trump administration,” Seller said. “We are not acting against his administration, but against the partisan policies of the Kennedy Center as a result of his recent takeover.” Grenell called the cancellation a sign of political intolerance to conservative audiences.

The “Hamilton” run in 2022 sold $26 million in tickets (including subscriptions). The center paid Seller’s production company a $22.7 million fee, according to tax filings, and spent about $700,000 on marketing, according to the 2022 final all-discipline report. That’s to say nothing of the merchandise and concession sales generated by the more than 160,000 attendees.

The current leadership has not publicly acknowledged any challenges with ticket sales. But the chairman of the board has been serving as a pitchman.

In a recent Truth Social post, Trump praised the building’s newly painted columns and referred to the center as the “TRUMP KENNEDY, whoops, I mean KENNEDY CENTER.”

He also encouraged people to visit a building that “will soon be the finest Arts and Entertainment Center anywhere in the World.”

“Come see for yourself,” Trump wrote. “We are remaining fully open during construction, renovation, and beautification.”

Methodology

On a daily basis, The Post recorded the number of tickets available for 63 performances at the Kennedy Center’s Opera House, Concert Hall and Eisenhower Theater from Sept. 3 to Oct. 19. The figures all came from the venue’s ticketing sales website. We compared that with per-production sales figures contained in the Kennedy Center’s “all-discipline” reports for fiscal 2022, 2023, 2024 and partial data for fiscal 2025.

We calculated the share of seats still available for sale on the day of each performance (or for four weekend matinee shows, the day before), using the number of seats shown in the ticketing system for the theater as the denominator.

For prior years, we calculated the percentage of seats available as the venue capacity minus tickets sold, tickets comped and blacked-out seats, to get a figure comparable to the number of seats available for sale on the website. Blacked-out seats are treated as unavailable, so the capacity is constant for all shows in a given venue.

For some slow-selling shows this year, the Kennedy Center blocked out whole sections of a theater. If a tier of seats was completely unavailable for sale every day in the week leading up to a performance, and if at least 25 percent of seats in the “Box & Chorister” or “Box Tier” section were available (to distinguish a near-sellout of the top tiers from those seats being unavailable for sale), then The Post’s analysis treated those seats as unsold. This was the case for 10 shows.

For calculating the median seat availability, Kennedy Center internal data for 2021-2024 is from internal “all-discipline” reports that summarize sales for each production, regardless of how many shows occurred. The Post looked at any production that had performances between Sept. 3 and Oct. 19. For 2025 data gathered by The Post, the data includes only performances that occurred within that date range.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> The 2026 Grammys were headlined by Bad Bunny's historic win for Album of the Year with 'Debí Tirar Más Fotos', the first entirely Spanish-language album to earn the top prize. Throughout the ceremony, Bad Bunny and other artists like Billie Eilish and Olivia Dean used their platforms to speak out on immigrant rights and protest ICE, highlighting the shifting landscape of American identity and the global dominance of Spanish-language music.

        Like a lot of immigrants lately—like a lot of Americans lately—Trevor Noah is mulling life after the United States. Early in this year’s Grammys, during an interlude between speeches and performances, the ceremony’s host asked Bad Bunny a question: “If things keep getting worse in America, can I come live with you in Puerto Rico?”

Bad Bunny grimaced and stated the obvious: Puerto Rico is in America. Noah tried to shush him, saying, “Don’t tell them that.”

This jokey segment set the table for what turned out to be Bad Bunny’s night, at a time when the country is roiling in conflict over the nature of American identity. One week before the 31-year-old singer and rapper Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio will take the stage at the Super Bowl halftime show, he won three trophies, including the night’s final prize, Album of the Year. He was among a raft of stars who spoke out on behalf of immigrants and against ICE from the stage—but his wins, and his words, met the moment in a unique way. He’s become a political flashpoint because of where he comes from and what language he speaks, and he’s not pretending otherwise.

His first win of the night was for Best Música Urbana Album—a category established in 2022 to celebrate the ascendant strain of Spanish-language popular music of which Bad Bunny is the undisputed king. The award was presented by the Cuban Dominican American Saturday Night Live actor Marcello Hernández and the Colombian pop star Karol G, who riffed about the Spanish-language music their parents played around the house when they were kids. The nominees in this year’s Música Urbana category, Hernández said, are the musicians he himself will someday play around the house for his own kids.

“Before I say thanks to God, I’m gonna say, ‘ICE out,’” Bad Bunny said during his speech for this award. “We’re not savage. We’re not animals. We’re not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.” The terms he used echoed ones that Donald Trump and his followers have used to describe immigrants over the past year. Bad Bunny underplayed his anger, speaking with quiet intensity, and ended with a call to avoid hatred and to fight back with love.

The phrase he had used, “ICE out,” was inscribed on pins sported by a number of artists at the Grammys. The 26-year-old British singer Olivia Dean, accepting the award for Best New Artist, began her speech by pointing out that she is a granddaughter of an immigrant. She added, “I’m a product of bravery, and I think those people deserve to be celebrated.” When Billie Eilish won the award for Song of the Year, she said, “No one is illegal on stolen land”—a common slogan at anti-ICE protests.

That Bad Bunny won Album of the Year wasn’t a huge shock: His 2025 album, Debí Tirar Más Fotos, is a commercial smash and a critical darling that earned him his fourth year of being the most streamed artist in the world. What’s more, this is the first year in which all the members of the voting body for the Latin Grammys were invited to vote in the main Grammys. Even so, Bad Bunny didn’t seem like he took the victory for granted. When the singer Harry Styles, presenting the night’s big award, read out Bad Bunny’s name, the rapper looked down and covered his face with his hand. All evening, he’d looked slick and dapper in a tuxedo with corsetlike stitching on the back. Now the room was cheering, but Bad Bunny was silent and tearing up.

The speech he gave was primarily in Spanish. This also was no surprise, given that Bad Bunny only ever performs in his native language. But it was also a reminder of the historic nature of his win: Debí Tirar Más Fotos is the first Album of the Year sung entirely in Spanish. “I want to dedicate this award to all the people that had to leave their homeland, their country, to follow their dreams,” he said in the speech’s brief English portion. Then, in Spanish, he dedicated his win to all Latinos and the artists who deserved to be on the stage before him.

        Sign up for Work in Progress, a newsletter about work, the economy, and how to solve some of America’s biggest problems.

Cue the bankers’ equivalent of white smoke: Donald Trump has finally named his pick to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve. This morning, Trump announced that he will nominate Kevin Warsh, a former Wall Street banker and Fed governor, to lead America’s central bank. Unlike some of the other contenders for the job, Warsh does not have a track record as an avowed Trump loyalist. For that reason, the response to his nomination from mainstream figures has been mostly positive. “Kevin Warsh is well above the bar on both substance and independence to be Chair of the Federal Reserve,” Jason Furman, who served as the chair of Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, posted on X. But Warsh’s record raises the possibility that he is a partisan actor whose views on monetary policy are shaped less by real economic conditions than by whether a Democrat or Republican is in power.

Trump has not been shy about what he wants in a Fed chair: someone who will lower interest rates. He has constantly attacked current Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not slashing rates fast enough, to the point of launching an obviously spurious criminal investigation into him. Powell has stood firm, but his term as chair expires in May. This gives Trump the chance to install someone who will do what he wants.

That someone was long expected to be Kevin Hassett, the head of Trump’s National Economic Council. Hassett, who was once a widely respected conservative economist, has in recent years taken a sharp turn into Trumpist propaganda. A Hassett chairmanship therefore augured reckless rate cuts that could trigger a fresh bout of dangerous inflation. This spooked Wall Street. Major bond investors met with the administration to tell them how worried they were. After Trump’s Department of Justice launched its investigation into Powell, Republican officials including Senate Majority Leader John Thune questioned the probe’s legitimacy and asserted the importance of central-bank independence. Senator Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said that he would refuse to vote on a nominee for Fed chair until the Powell investigation had finished.

This backlash appeared to get to Trump. He began saying that he’d had a change of heart—that Hassett was actually too valuable an asset as the NEC director to give up. And now the president has instead nominated Warsh, to much applause from the economics establishment. “I believe he brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills,” Mohamed El-Erian, the former CEO of the global investment firm PIMCO, posted on X. “I think he’s a great pick,” Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told me. “The most important task for the next Fed chair is to preserve the central bank’s independence. And I don’t think there is anyone who is better suited to do that than Kevin.”

The reason for relief is twofold. First, Warsh’s résumé is conventional. He spent his early career on Wall Street and served as a top economic adviser to George W. Bush before becoming, at the age of 35, the youngest-ever appointee to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the body that votes on interest rates. When the financial crisis hit two years later, Warsh acted as the central bank’s liaison to Wall Street, helping engineer bank bailouts.

Second, Warsh is seen as an inflation hawk who will err on the side of higher, not lower, interest rates. During the 2010s, he became known within Wall Street and Washington circles as one of the fiercest critics of the Fed’s zero-interest-rate policy, to the point of warning about inflation when unemployment was still at 10 percent. “He’s a pretty stone-cold hard-money guy,” Jared Bernstein, who served as the chair of Joe Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, told me. “It’s a peculiar choice for Trump, because the Fed that Warsh wants is very different from the one Trump wants.”

The case against Warsh is this: What he wants seems to change depending on which party controls the White House. Warsh was a staunch inflation hawk during the Obama administration. Then Trump was elected, and he seemed to soften. In a 2018 Wall Street Journal op-ed titled “Fed Tightening? Not Now,” Warsh and his co-author, Stanley Druckenmiller, argued that, “given recent economic and market developments, the Fed should cease—for now—its double-barreled blitz of higher interest rates and tighter liquidity.”

“He’s someone who has repeatedly shown a willingness to change his positions on a dime when it’s politically convenient,” Skanda Amarnath, the executive director of Employ America, a Fed-focused think tank, told me. “Sure, he’ll give lectures about inflation and sing the praises of high interest rates when a Democrat is in power, but the moment that a Republican is in office, he’ll suddenly change his tune.”

Under Biden, Warsh reprised his hawkish outlook. As late as September 2024, he criticized the Fed for cutting interest rates prematurely. Then, after Trump took office early last year—and it became known that Trump was considering him for Fed chair—Warsh began advocating for rate cuts. In a November Wall Street Journal op-ed, he argued that the United States was on the verge of an AI-driven productivity boom that would be a “significant disinflationary force” and that the Fed “should abandon the dogma that inflation is caused when the economy grows too much and workers get paid too much.” (Why these facts weren’t true a year earlier, when Biden was in office, was left unclear.)

In this telling, Warsh is a partisan shape-shifter who advocates for high interest rates (which results in slower growth and higher unemployment) under Democrats and lower rates (faster growth, lower unemployment) under Republicans. As my colleague Jonathan Chait pointed out last year, this description also applies to Trump himself, who spent the Obama years tweeting about how the Fed needed to be “reined in or we will soon be Greece”; he then demanded lower rates during his first term, went back to attacking the Fed for cutting rates under Biden, and then immediately demanded rate cuts once he was back in the White House. This shared approach—easy money for me, economic pain for thee—might explain why Trump was comfortable nominating Warsh.

No one can say which version of Warsh will lead the Fed, assuming he’s confirmed. Every other high-level presidential appointee during Trump’s second term has proved willing to carry out his wishes. Perhaps Warsh will break the pattern. Quite a lot of economic outcomes could turn on whether he does.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> A study by More in Common identifies four distinct segments within Donald Trump’s 2024 voter coalition: MAGA Hardliners, Anti-Woke Conservatives, Mainline Republicans, and the Reluctant Right. The research suggests Trump’s enduring support stems from his ability to fulfill emotional roles as a 'builder' and 'redeemer' for these groups, transcending the need for ideological consistency.

        <hr/>
        The first year of Donald Trump’s second term has made two things clear. First, the MAGA coalition is not breaking up any time soon. Even after the especially chaotic events of the past few weeks, Trump supporters are sticking by their man. Second, faith in Trump’s leadership is not driven by his adherence to a coherent political ideology. Trump, who, as part of his “America First” policy, once declared that he would be “getting out of the nation-building business,” has now declared that the U.S. “will run the country” of Venezuela for the foreseeable future. An administration that promised to look out for the “working man” has handed billions of tax dollars back to America’s wealthiest households while stripping health care from the most vulnerable.

If ideological consistency can’t explain the enduring loyalty of Trump’s base, what does? A new study by More in Common, the nonprofit research organization where we work, finds that Trump’s coalition is not monolithic. It consists of four groups, each with a distinct profile and perspective. Trump’s political power depends on his ability to connect with these groups on different emotional and psychological grounds.

Over the course of 10 months, we surveyed more than 10,000 people who said they voted for Trump in 2024, and conducted extensive focus groups, conversations, and in-depth interviews. We then identified groups of Trump voters with similar attitudes and beliefs.

About 29 percent of 2024 Trump voters are what we call the “MAGA Hardliners.” These are the fiery core of Trump’s base, mostly composed of white Gen Xers and Baby Boomers, who are animated by the belief that God is on their side in America’s existential struggle between good and evil. Then there are the “Anti-Woke Conservatives” (21 percent): a more secular and affluent group of voters deeply frustrated by what they perceive as the takeover of schools, culture, and institutions by the progressive left. Another 30 percent are the “Mainline Republicans”: a more racially diverse group of middle-of-the-road conservatives who prioritize border security, a strong economy, and cultural stability. Finally, we have the “Reluctant Right” (20 percent). Members of this group, unlike the other three, are not necessarily part of Trump’s base; they voted for him, but have ambivalent feelings toward him. Only half identify as Republicans, and many picked Trump because he seemed “less bad” than the alternative.

Our research suggests that Trump’s ability to play different roles for his coalition yields an emotional payoff that exceeds the value of philosophical or logical consistency.

The first role that Trump plays, which resonates for all four groups, is that of a “builder.” Trump’s social-media rants and diatribes against “corrupt” institutions create a common misperception that his appeal centers on tearing things down. In fact, his voters see him primarily as a constructive force. When asked to choose from a set of roles that they associate with Trump, 58 percent of survey participants selected “a builder trying to fix a broken system”—the highest share of any option offered. For the Reluctant Right, this sense of construction is paired with an image of managerial competence: They are more likely than any of the other groups to describe Trump as a “businessman” or a “CEO running a company.” The perception of Trump’s positive, constructive role helps explain why “hope” is the emotion that Trump supporters most commonly associate with his presidency.

Trump’s second role is that of “redeemer”: someone who can restore his supporters’ status and respect in a society that they feel has long looked down on them. Most Trump voters in our study believe that America’s cultural institutions have been dominated by those who scorn their values and way of life. Seventy-six percent agree with the statement “The woke left has ruined American education, news, and entertainment.” Accompanying this diagnosis is a sense of disrespect from political elites and Democrats. Only a quarter of Trump voters feel respected by Americans who voted for Democrats, whereas 84 percent believe that “President Trump respects people like me.” (The important exception to this is the Reluctant Right, who feel respected by neither Trump nor Democrats.)

The third role is that of an energizing “blasphemer”—a violator of progressive norms. This identity resonates most strongly with MAGA Hardliners and Anti-Woke Conservatives, who believe that the political left has become a sanctimonious elite imposing its worldview on everyone else. About 90 percent of MAGA Hardliners and Anti-Woke Conservatives agree that the “left actually hates America.” This generates a desire not just for redemption but also for retribution. Trump presents himself as a norm-breaker who delights in poking his finger in his critics’ eyes: More than three-quarters of MAGA Hardliners and more than half of Anti-Woke Conservatives believe that “President Trump should make the left pay for its mistakes and lies.” This sense of transgression fuels a gleeful energy that runs through much of Trump’s public communication. As Gina, a 50-year-old white woman who lives in Florida, told us, Trump is “a gigantic orange flashing middle finger, and I love it.”

The final role—one that appeals especially to MAGA Hardliners—is what we call the “grand narrator.” Trump’s appeal can be understood only in the context of a decades-long collapse of trust in American institutions including Congress, the press, academia, and the scientific establishment. MAGA Hardliners—and, to a lesser extent, Anti-Woke Conservatives—overwhelmingly view the media as dishonest and believe that the “deep state” is setting the course for the whole nation. Even with unified Republican control of the White House, Supreme Court, and Congress, a majority of both groups still distrusts the federal government. In this uncertain epistemic landscape, Trump has emerged not just as a decisive leader but as a central purveyor of truth: 93 percent of MAGA Hardliners and 72 percent of Anti-Woke Conservatives say they trust him more than “all” or “most other sources.” In other words, Trump has positioned himself as both the narrator and the hero of his own story.

Politicians typically try to appeal to voters by aligning their policies with voters’ preferences. Trump satisfies deeper needs. For those despairing about our country’s direction, he offers hope; for those who feel disrespected, validation; for those who feel doubtful, clarity.

Trump’s political skills were forged in WWE arenas, on reality-TV sets, and in the luxury real-estate business—industries that live and die by their ability to capture attention, simplify narratives, and deliver emotional impact. These experiences taught him how to establish emotional bonds with audiences that far outweigh any connection based on shared ideology.

Trump’s detractors may dismiss these bonds as empty or irrelevant. But for the people who experience them, they are very real. The relationship Trump has established with tens of millions of Americans offers them something they cannot attain through conventional politics. In his various roles, he embodies the reality that they want. This is the source of his power.

        <hr/>
        Donald Trump has so far gotten his way on tariffs and tax cuts, but one economic goal eludes him: lower interest rates. Reduced borrowing costs would in theory make homes and cars cheaper for consumers, help businesses invest in creating jobs, and allow the government to finance its massive debt load at a steep discount. In the president’s mind, only one obstacle stands in the way of this obvious economic win-win: the Federal Reserve.

Trump has mused publicly about replacing Fed Chair Jerome Powell since before he even took office, calling him “Too Late Powell” (as in waiting too long to cut rates) and a “numbskull.” Those threats have gotten more serious recently. In a meeting with House Republicans last Tuesday, the president reportedly showed off the draft of a letter that would have fired the Fed chair. Trump later claimed that it was “highly unlikely” that he would fire Powell, but he left open the possibility that the chair might have to “leave for fraud.” To that end, the administration has launched an investigation into Powell’s management of an expensive renovation of the central bank’s headquarters. (Any wrongdoing would, at least in theory, offer a legal pretext for firing him.)

This plan is unlikely to succeed in the near term. The administration’s legal case against Powell is almost certainly specious, and the Fed sets interest rates by the votes of 12 board members, not according to the chair’s sole discretion. Even if the president eventually does get his way, however, and installs enough pliant board members to slash government interest rates, this could have the paradoxical effect of raising the interest rates paid in the real world. If that happened, mortgages would get more expensive, businesses would have a harder time investing, and government financing would become even less sustainable.

Trump seems to have a simple mental model of monetary policy: The Federal Reserve unilaterally sets all of the interest rates across the entire economy. The reality is more complicated. The central bank controls what is known as the federal-funds rate, the interest rate at which banks loan one another money. A lower federal-funds rate means that banks can charge lower interest on the loans they issue. This generally causes rates on short-term debt, such as credit-card annual percentage rates and small-business loans, to fall.

But the interest rates that people care the most about are on long-term debt, such as mortgages and car loans. These are influenced less by the current federal-funds rate and more by expectations of what the economic environment will look like in the coming years, even decades. The Fed influences these long-term rates not only directly, by changing the federal-funds rate, but also indirectly by sending a signal about where the economy is headed.

What signal would the Fed be sending if it suddenly slashed the federal-funds rate from its current level of about 4.5 percent to Trump’s preferred 1 percent? Typically, an interest-rate cut of this magnitude would be reserved for a calamity in which the Fed drastically needs to increase the money supply to give the labor market a big boost. (This is what happened after the 2008 financial crisis.) Today’s economy has a very different problem: Unemployment is low, but inflation remains above the Fed’s target and has risen in recent months. In this environment, most economists predict that a dramatic increase in the money supply would send prices soaring.

Last week, in response to Trump flirting with the possibility of firing Powell, a key measure of investors’ long-term-inflation expectations spiked dramatically. The mere prospect of higher inflation is “kryptonite” for lenders and bondholders, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told me, because it creates the risk that any debt paid back in the future will be worth a lot less than it is today. In such a situation, Zandi explained, banks and investors would likely impose a higher interest rate up front.

Many experts, including former Fed chairs, believe that cutting rates simply because the president demands it could have an even more profound consequence: It would tell the world that the U.S. central bank can no longer be trusted to credibly manage the money supply going forward. Investors would “get really nervous about holding U.S. Treasuries,” the economist Jason Furman told me, and demand a far higher return for buying them to make up for the higher risk—which would, perversely, drive interest rates higher, not lower. As evidence, Furman pointed out that, on several occasions, including last week, the interest rates on 10- and 30-year government bonds have shot up in response to Trump threatening to fire Powell. (In fact, the gap between short- and long-term rates jumped to its highest level since 2021 last week in the less-than-one-hour window between when reports surfaced about Trump planning to fire Powell and the president’s denial of that plan.) Because most long-term interest rates, including those for home mortgages, student loans, and auto loans, are directly pegged to the rate on government bonds—which serves as a sort of base rate for the entire financial system—all of those other rates would rise as well.

The precise consequences of a move as drastic as what Trump has suggested are impossible to forecast with certainty. And the predictions of economists have been proved wrong many times. (Remember the inevitable recession of 2023?) Still, recent history has not been kind to populist leaders who try to forcibly lower interest rates. Between 2019 and 2022, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan replaced three central-bank governors with loyalists who were willing to slash interest rates even as prices were rising. This caused inflation to spiral even higher, at one point reaching 85 percent. Foreign investors panicked, prompting a fire sale of Turkish government bonds. Long-term interest rates spiked, the Turkish lira crashed in value, and the country appeared on the verge of hyperinflation. The crisis began to abate only when Erdoğan changed course in 2023 and brought in new central-bank leadership who raised interest rates to above 45 percent in a desperate effort to restore credibility. (Inflation has since fallen considerably but remains very high.) “When investors start running for the hills, you get into really dangerous territory,” Zandi told me.

A path exists to persuade the Fed to cut interest rates without such a high risk of backfiring. The problem for Trump is that it would require a complete reversal of the highest-priority economic policies of his second term. Last September, the Fed began cutting interest rates and signaled that it would continue to do so. Then Trump entered office and threatened sky-high tariffs on every country on the planet. In response, the Fed has refrained from cutting rates further, terrified that Trump’s policies will unleash another bout of inflation.

There is some debate, including within the Fed itself, over whether tariff-induced price increases will in fact lead to sustained higher inflation. But for now at least, the central bank doesn’t appear willing to take any chances. “In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,” Powell said on July 1. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which passed days later and includes trillions of dollars of unpaid-for tax cuts, has only made Powell’s case stronger.

If the president were serious about lowering the cost of borrowing for families and businesses, he would be wise to leave Powell alone and simply stop enacting wildly irresponsible policies. Trump tends to prefer a different approach to people and institutions refusing to do his bidding: force them into submission. But America’s central bank isn’t like most other institutions; it is the central node in a highly complex chain of interactions that undergirds the entire global economy. Even one seemingly small error or misstep can result in disaster. If Trump manages to break the Fed, he will likely regret it.

        <hr/>
        One popular strain of urban-policy thinking opposes gentrification—the arrival of affluent people into poor neighborhoods—and argues that poverty should be rectified by ever greater expenditure on public housing. The opposite might be true: Government spending can help, but it can also hurt, as badly designed public-housing projects have done. So long as gentrification brings rich and poor together, and offers the latter greater opportunity to take part in a healthy economy, it looks less like a villainous process and more like a heroic one.

Few places illustrate the aspirations and failures of American housing policy as well as the Techwood Homes in downtown Atlanta—one of the first federal housing projects. Its completion, in 1935, even drew the attendance of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who switched on its electricity. To make way for the development, the old slums—in which roughly a quarter of residents were Black—had been cleared away. But the 604 new units were for white tenants only until 1968, when civil-rights laws forced integration. Like the ramshackle shacks it replaced, Techwood fell into disrepair. By the 1990s, Techwood had resegregated, becoming almost exclusively Black, and turned into a byword in Atlanta for urban decline. Gates and windows lay shattered; residents complained of squalid living conditions; drug trafficking and gang violence were out of control.

In 1993, Atlanta received one of the first grants awarded by the federal HOPE VI program—which aimed to knock down the most decrepit public-housing projects in America and replace them with better housing—to demolish and rebuild the Techwood Homes. The demolitions took place just before the city hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics. If you went to Techwood’s site today—sandwiched between Georgia Tech and the Coca-Cola museum—you would see a commemorative plaque but almost none of the original brick buildings that fell into dilapidation. Instead, you would find yourself in Centennial Place, a mixed-income community with subsidized apartments alongside private, market-rate housing. It was intentionally designed to reduce the isolation of the urban poor—and it’s succeeding.

A new, rigorous study of 200 HOPE VI sites, including Techwood, shows that the redevelopment significantly improved the lives of children. The reasons reveal a crucial fact about economic opportunity: To have social mobility, you need social integration. “Just giving people cash, just giving people education, doesn’t do as much as if you pair it with connections that then help them,” Raj Chetty, a Harvard economist and one of the study’s authors, told me.

From 1993 to 2010, HOPE VI spent $17 billion to knock down and remake projects. The program was controversial from the outset. The original residents did not have a right to return to the townhomes and other smaller structures that replaced the demolished larger complexes, and ultimately only 28 percent of residents came back. There were fewer units in the lower-density replacements. An influential 2002 report by the National Housing Law Project and other groups titled “False HOPE” argued that the new mixed-income model was “a social engineering scheme built on a number of inaccurate, irrelevant, and harmful assumptions about low income families and their neighborhoods.” These critiques were made during a time of growing revulsion against slum clearance and heavy-handed urban-renewal attempts; the reentry of the creative classes to city centers was only beginning to gain notice. Activists and some academic critics derided HOPE VI as a state-sponsored gentrification program, doomed to harm the people it was intended to help.

But the new study, “Creating High-Opportunity Neighborhoods: Evidence from the HOPE VI Program,” found nothing of the sort. Chetty and six colleagues at Harvard, Cornell University, and the Census Bureau used tax-return data to track outcomes for residents decades after they lived in neighborhoods changed by the HOPE VI experiment. The benefits to children living in the new low-density housing project are considerable: Their earnings in adulthood increased by 2.8 percent for every year they lived in the new developments instead of the old ones, the researchers calculated. This holds even when the researchers compare siblings within the same family. Overall, children whose families moved into revitalized units earn 16 percent more than they otherwise would have earned, they are 17 percent more likely to attend college, and boys are 20 percent less likely to go to jail in adulthood. The future-income increases alone greatly exceed the up-front cost of rebuilding, the authors argue.

The paper contends that the HOPE VI program delivered such significant benefits to children because the demolitions and reconstructions “increased friendships between children from low- and high-income families in high schools near public housing sites.” (In this case, cross-class friendship is measured empirically through proprietary data from Facebook.) “Distressed public housing projects were essentially islands that had limited social interaction with nearby communities,” the paper argues. “The HOPE VI program built a bridge to surrounding communities, allowing public housing residents to benefit from interacting with those residents.” The exact reason is still being worked out: It could be straightforward—that high-achieving peers boost education for others—or more subtle (for example, that closer contact with surrounding areas yields more introductions to parents who can provide job referrals). But integration does seem to matter a great deal. The researchers’ results show that simply living in the newly constructed projects was insufficient. Children who moved into these revitalized neighborhoods but experienced no increase in cross-class friendships saw essentially no benefit.

The study does not focus on children displaced by the demolitions. But Matthew Staiger, one of the paper’s co-authors, has separate research showing that they too went on to have markedly higher earnings. For adults, however, the findings are more mixed. Although neighborhoods became considerably richer after the HOPE VI revitalizations—household incomes increased by 45 percent, and poverty rates dropped by 12 percentage points—this is due entirely to richer adults moving in. The residents of the original projects, most of whom are scattered to other neighborhoods, are no better off in terms of income even years later. One recurring finding in social-mobility research is that interventions targeted to poor children yield significant results; for adults who are already in poverty, improvement is harder to attain even with expensive interventions.

Our understanding of what kinds of Americans experience upward mobility—and which ones don’t—has improved immensely over the past 10 years. Much of that progress is due to the work of Chetty, whose use of administrative data collected by government agencies has provided granular answers to questions sociologists and economists have debated for decades. These papers, often co-written with prominent economists such as Nathaniel Hendren, John Friedman, and Lawrence Katz, point toward a cohesive set of findings: Whatever their parents’ circumstances, the kind of neighborhood children grow up in substantially affects their life outcome, for better or for worse. Economists are used to explaining life outcomes as a result of financial or human capital, but Chetty says the cumulative research shows that social capital is just as important.

This lesson is especially stark when applied to childhood poverty. It is unsurprising that poor material circumstances at birth predict poverty in adulthood. Less obvious is the fact that poor children living in concentrated poverty—like those in infamous superblock towers—face worse outcomes than poor children who live near wealthier peers. We know this from studies following the life trajectory of children living in poor, segregated neighborhoods after they were moved by government programs—as in the Gautreaux Assisted Housing Program from the 1970s to the 1990s and the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment in the 1990s. The MTO results, written by Chetty, Hendren, and Katz and published in 2016, stunned the economics field after finding that young children whose families left high-poverty census tracts after receiving housing vouchers went on to have 31 percent higher incomes in adulthood (alongside improvements in college attendance and reduced rates of single parenthood). The HOPE VI results show the converse of the MTO experiment to be true too: Kids don’t necessarily have to change locations to improve their life outcome—neighborhoods can be made to improve around them.

These results in economics ultimately vindicate foundational ideas in sociology—developed by scholars such as William Julius Wilson and Robert Sampson—that the concentration of disadvantage and social isolation worsen the effects of material disadvantage. The findings also raise an immediate question: If the primary reason that HOPE VI improved outcomes was that it boosted social capital for disadvantaged children, how can that positive intervention be replicated elsewhere? Laura Tach, a Cornell sociologist and co-author of the paper, told me that the HOPE VI program could have boosted social integration through several mechanisms: The demolition of towers (which in many cases were packed together in huge superblocks) made the outside world physically easier to access, reductions in violence and crime made outside connection psychologically easier, and complimentary community-support services for job training and after-school programs may have directly brought people of different social backgrounds together.

There is another process that improves neighborhoods around poor children, both by bringing higher-income peers nearer to them and by reducing the violence they are exposed to. This process often occurs without explicit governmental intervention or cost. The problem is that it is regularly dismissed as gentrification, a phenomenon that is not usually cheered. The most common objection to gentrification is that it results in displacement of incumbent residents. The empirical evidence for this is weaker than conventionally assumed. One paper examining children who received Medicaid benefits in New York City from 2009 to 2015 found no elevated rates of moving for those in gentrifying neighborhoods. The HOPE VI study suggests that gentrification should improve outcomes for kids, so long as it actually improves social integration.

        Updated at 11:45 a.m. ET on January 15, 2026

As Donald Trump seeks to take direct control of the Federal Reserve, the debate has fallen into a familiar pattern: Trump attacks a crucial institution; Democrats line up to reflexively defend that institution. This is unfortunate. Trump’s attacks on Fed independence are likely illegal, and the consequences of him personally ordering dramatic interest-rate cuts could be profoundly harmful, but preserving the status quo would also be a mistake. The central bank has long abused its power in ways that benefit the financial sector at the expense of everyone else.

The core idea of central-bank independence is that the setting of interest rates should not be influenced by the incentives of partisan politics. Economists have demonstrated what is common sense: Maximizing long-term economic health sometimes means short-term pain. But incumbent politicians, with an eye toward the next election, will always be tempted to sacrifice long-term considerations to avoid immediate hardship. Allowing a central bank to set interest rates without political interference solves this problem.

On this mark, the Fed deserves praise. It has long set interest rates independently and, for the most part, wisely. But setting interest rates is not the only thing the Fed does. It also regulates large parts of America’s financial sector, operates and regulates our payment systems, and serves as a lender of last resort; it can print money and bail out institutions and investors that it deems worthy. The Fed has interpreted its independence to extend to all of these areas, operating as it sees fit—even to the point of ignoring laws it doesn’t agree with.

In 1994, for example, Congress passed the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act, requiring the Federal Reserve to issue strong regulations within six months to protect people from subprime mortgages. Alan Greenspan, at the time the chair of the Fed, declined to do so, in part because he disagreed with Congress’s instruction to categorize certain types of loans as “unfair” or “abusive.” Years later, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded that the subprime-mortgage debacle had been preventable: “The prime example is the Federal Reserve’s pivotal failure to stem the flow of toxic mortgages, which it could have done by setting prudent mortgage-lending standards. The Federal Reserve was the one entity empowered to do so and it did not.”

Have you ever wondered why you have to wait so long to access money deposited in your bank account? Here, again, blame the Fed, which operates the country’s largest payment systems (such as ACH transfers) while also regulating private interbank payments. In 1987, Congress passed a law requiring banks to give people access to their own money in “​​as short a time as possible” under available technology. But implementation was left to the Fed. And in the past 38 years, the Fed has never shortened the time a bank is allowed to hold your check—that is, the time between when you deposit it and when you can access the money. The exact time varies, but a check deposited on a Friday is generally not available until Tuesday. The resulting delay causes wealthy people to lose a little interest on that deposit, which earns some money for the banks. But the real moneymaker for banks are the overdraft fees that banks charge on people who live paycheck to paycheck. In my research, I have found that up to 40 percent of overdrafts are caused by the lag in crediting people’s accounts with their own money, including delays in so-called direct deposits.

American banks and credit unions made at least $30 billion in annual profits from overdrafts as of 2020. For some banks, the fees are essentially their entire business model. Arvest Bank, for example, reported $71.8 million in overdraft fees in 2024 and only $53 million in net income, meaning it would not even have been profitable without overdrafts. Arvest is owned by the Walton family and is one of the largest banks regulated by the St. Louis Federal Reserve. If the Fed implemented the law on payments, banks like Arvest would be in financial trouble. But the Fed seems to view its job as ensuring that banks are profitable, even if that comes at the expense of people living in precarity. When one bank CEO christened his boat Overdraft, perhaps he toasted the Fed.

The Fed’s habit of helping banks while avoiding legal requirements to help people is on full display in its role as the “lender of last resort” during financial crises. Congress gave the central bank this authority in 1933. For generations, the Fed declined to use it, instead cajoling the private sector to pick up the tab for costly bank failures. That changed in 2008. After Bear Stearns collapsed, the Fed “broke the glass” and used $30 billion to prop up JPMorgan’s purchase of the failed bank. Bear Stearns shareholders got $10 a share, while thousands of families who were sold toxic subprime mortgages financed through Bear Stearns—the same mortgages that the Fed refused to regulate—lost their homes.

During the coronavirus pandemic, Congress tried to leverage the magic bailout machine, giving money to the Fed to allow it to lend $600 billion to small and medium-size businesses. But the Fed’s Main Street Business Lending Program turned out to be a Rube Goldberg system that business owners struggled to navigate, leading the CEO of the Association for Corporate Growth to say, “I could neither borrow from the program nor find someone who has received a loan through it.” According to a Boston Fed report, only $17.5 billion, or less than 3 percent of the promised amount, ended up flowing to Main Street businesses.

Instead, the Fed focused on Wall Street, lending more than $100 billion to buy corporate debt, keep money-market mutual funds whole, help investment banks, and prop up investors who otherwise would have lost money. Big corporations used much of these bailout funds to boost their stock price through share buybacks and dividends, and didn’t have to protect workers hit hard by the pandemic. The Fed lent twice as much money—$33.5 billion—to 25 of the largest banks in the world than it did to America’s more than 30 million small businesses. There are no doubt valid logistical reasons why it’s harder to lend to small businesses than to big banks. But that is not enough to explain the extreme disparity between the two programs. That gap reflects the fact that the Fed sees its job primarily as serving the banking system, not ordinary people and local businesses.

Trump’s plan to turn the Fed into an arm of the White House is the worst of all possible worlds. The president has already undermined the Fed’s independence by appointing his chief economist, Stephen Miran, as a governor even as Miran continues to hold his White House job. If the Supreme Court allows Trump to fire and replace Fed Governor Lisa Cook, then every Fed governor would serve at the pleasure of the president and could be fired for any vote that displeases him. Interest rates will be held hostage by short-term electoral considerations.

If, however, the Court rules against Trump—as it is widely expected to do—congressional Democrats should not consider the matter of Fed independence resolved. Instead, a future Democratic administration and Congress should pass legislation preserving the Fed’s independent power to set monetary policy, while stripping most other authorities away from the central bank. The logic of central-bank independence simply does not apply to such matters as bank regulation and payment systems, which ought to be subject to democratic control.

During the 2008 financial crisis, Senator Chris Dodd’s original version of what became the Dodd-Frank Act envisioned shifting a large amount of bank regulation from the Fed to the comptroller of the currency. Dodd lost a vote on that element of the bill 90–9, showing the political obstacles to reform. Dodd-Frank did require the Federal Reserve to set new regulations on executive compensation for bankers. Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, however, has refused to finalize the regulation. More than 15 years after Dodd-Frank, the necessity of Dodd’s original approach has only gotten clearer.

Congress could relieve the Fed of its bailout responsibilities, assigning that job to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, subject to congressional approval. This would build on a system of lending to banks that the FDIC successfully used during the 2008 financial crisis, codified into law as part of Dodd-Frank. Members of Congress must weigh the popular backlash against bailouts with economic necessity; unlike the Fed, they face democratic accountability.

Trump’s attacks on America’s bedrock institutions deserve a thoughtful response, not a defensive one. Trump often identifies real problems, even if he offers terrible solutions. The Federal Reserve has abused its independence for decades, substituting its judgment for the law with no mechanisms to hold it accountable. As a spate of recent insider-trading scandals among senior Fed officials demonstrates, the institution can’t even hold its own personnel accountable.

Democrats can oppose Trump’s efforts without rallying around a flawed institution that has put the interests of the most powerful ahead of those of the most vulnerable. To save the Fed’s independence on monetary policy, Congress should strip it of everything else.

With the possible exception of the president, no person has more sway over the fortunes of the United States economy than the chair of the Federal Reserve. Because the Fed controls the U.S. money supply, sets interest rates, regulates banks, and provides liquidity in an emergency, the chair’s decisions help determine the pace of inflation, the strength of the labor market, the stability of the financial system, and the cost of a mortgage. If the country faces an economic crisis, the chair’s job is to get us out of it.

Soon, this all-important position might be held by Kevin Hassett, the current director of Donald Trump’s National Economic Council. No doubt, Hassett is a Trump loyalist. And there’s reason to fear that, as chair, he will do Trump’s bidding, undermining the central bank’s independence and marking a new stage in the president’s control over the American economy.

When Trump nominated Hassett to chair his first-term Council of Economic Advisors, in 2017, the Washington economics establishment was delighted. A bipartisan group of influential economists, including top advisers for former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama as well as two former chairs of the Federal Reserve, wrote a letter urging the Senate to confirm him. As evidence of Hassett’s qualifications, the letter cited his “record of serious scholarship on a wide range of topics”; his stellar résumé, which included stints at the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department; and his efforts to “reach out to a wide range of people from across the ideological spectrum.”

Hassett is now the front-runner to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May, and some of the experts who endorsed Hassett for the CEA are similarly pleased about the prospect of him overseeing the central bank. “I think he’d be a good Fed chair,” Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, who has known Hassett for more than a decade and signed the 2017 letter, told me. “He’s smart, curious, willing to debate, and has a good working relationship with the president. Those are the qualities you need for this job.”

A close examination of Hassett’s record, alongside conversations with nearly a dozen of his former peers and colleagues, however, suggests that what was true about him in 2017 might not be true today. Over the past decade, Hassett has become an unapologetic Trump propagandist in ways that the phrase good working relationship doesn’t quite capture. In his years working for Trump, Hassett has proved willing to change his beliefs, misrepresent basic facts, and endorse dangerous conspiracy theories, all in an apparent effort to please the president. His obsequiousness probably explains why he is now on the verge of running the Fed, and introduces the possibility of a central bank willing to uncritically carry out the president’s wishes, economic consequences be damned.

Before his MAGA career, Hassett, who didn’t respond to multiple interview requests, spent several decades as a respected conservative economist. He received his Ph.D. in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1990, before going to work as an economics professor at Columbia Business School, a researcher at the Federal Reserve, and, in 1997, a resident scholar (and later director of economic-policy studies) at the American Enterprise Institute. At the time, AEI was the preeminent conservative think tank in Washington. Over the next two decades, Hassett wrote op-eds for The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal; appeared frequently on cable news; and advised the Republicans George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney on their presidential runs.

Like most conservative economists at the time, Hassett was a staunch deficit hawk, an advocate of higher levels of immigration, and, above all else, an unabashed free trader. During the Bush and Obama years, he called for major deficit reductions, defended the global trade system, and proposed that the U.S. double its intake of immigrants to boost GDP growth. In 2011, when Trump was floating a run for the presidency, Hassett wrote an op-ed eviscerating his proposal for a 25 percent tariff on all imports from China. “He appears to still have a tin ear on tax policy,” Hassett wrote of Trump, whose plan, he argued, “would be terrifyingly similar to the Smoot-Hawley tariffs that set off a trade war in 1930, and helped turn the stock market crash of 1929 into the Great Depression.”

The pre-MAGA version of Hassett had his share of questionable judgment calls. In September 1999, just months before the dot-com crash, he co-authored a book predicting that the Dow Jones would quadruple over the next three to five years. (This did not occur until 2021.) In November 2010, with unemployment at nearly 10 percent and the economy still in the throes of a recession, Hassett signed an open letter warning that the Fed’s efforts to boost the economy could trigger hyperinflation. The Fed ignored the letter, and inflation remained near or below 2 percent for the next decade.

Still, Hassett maintained a solid reputation among Washington insiders. Several of the signatories of the 2017 letter told me they believed that Hassett would be an adult in the room who would help prevent Trump from acting on his most dangerous impulses. (Much of the MAGA right opposed Hassett’s nomination for the same reason.) During the first two years of Trump’s presidency, this proved to be true. Although Hassett often defended the president’s decisions publicly, he was known to privately argue for a more conventional approach on issues such as immigration and trade. He was even willing to suggest that Trump was not omnipotent. When asked in a 2019 interview whether he supported Trump’s demand that the Fed slash interest rates, Hassett responded, “It’s not my job at CEA to give the Fed advice. My job at CEA is to remind people to respect the independence of the Fed.”

Then, in June 2019, Trump somewhat abruptly announced Hassett’s departure. The president’s first-term trade war with China was heating up and his spat with Powell was intensifying. Just a week before, Hassett had been excluded from a White House meeting in which the president decided to impose higher tariffs on Mexico, The New York Times reported.

In March 2020, Hassett was asked to return to the CEA to assist with the White House’s COVID response. Trump was busy downplaying the severity of the new coronavirus and insisting that the country had to swiftly reopen. If Hassett’s independence had gotten him pushed out the year before, he wouldn’t make the same mistake again. A few weeks after his return, the CEA released a model projecting that COVID deaths had already peaked and would drop to almost zero by mid-May. Experts immediately pointed out that Hassett had used a misleading method known as a cubic fit to make the mortality data appear less frightening.

“I was, quite frankly, pretty shocked that this had come from Kevin,” Dean Baker, a progressive economist who co-wrote several papers with Hassett and signed the 2017 letter supporting his nomination, told me. “It was the kind of thing that no serious analyst would ever produce.” Jason Furman, who chaired the CEA under Obama and had also signed the 2017 letter, tweeted at the time that the model might represent “the lowest point in the 74 year history” of the council. Hassett defended the chart by claiming that it wasn’t intended as a “forecast” but instead “just a different way of visualizing the model.”

At the time, many economists who had long known Hassett, including Baker, considered the cubic-fit episode a fluke. What they didn’t realize was that Hassett was, by his own account, in the midst of a profound ideological shift. In November 2021, Hassett published a retrospective of his time in the Trump administration called The Drift: Stopping America’s Slide Towards Socialism. It reads like a conversion experience. In it, Hassett describes his journey from an establishment figure who was deeply skeptical of Trump to a MAGA soldier who believed that Trump was engaged in an existential fight to save the U.S. from catastrophe. “Donald Trump found himself in the middle of a much bigger historical battle than the simple fight against Joe Biden or Hilary Clinton,” Hassett wrote. “He came to power determined to arrest and reverse the Drift to socialism. The entire Donald Trump saga only makes sense if one views him as a powerful opposition to the Left’s quest to defeat capitalism and turn the United States into a socialist country.”

Upon his return to the White House in 2025, Trump brought back a mere handful of his most trusted advisers from his first term. Hassett was among them. In January, he was appointed the head of Trump’s National Economic Council, and quickly emerged as one of the administration’s most important surrogates. Whenever the president floated some bizarre policy idea, issued a new threat, or told a brazen lie about the state of the economy, Hassett would be one of the first people on cable news justifying it. Gone were the carefully chosen language, the adherence to factual reality, and the reports of behind-the-scenes dissent that had characterized Hassett’s first two years working for Trump.

In April, the president announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs—the ones that would have introduced sky-high import duties on nearly every single country, as well as a few uninhabited islands, based on an incoherent formula. Hassett, the once ardent free trader, boasted on TV that Trump’s policy was an act of genius that would remake the global trade system for the better, raise gobs of revenue, and boost American industry. A week later, the president decided to implement a 90-day pause, and Hassett went back on TV to claim that this seemingly abrupt move had been the president’s real intention from the beginning. “This is the plan that he was pursuing all along,” he told Fox News. Hassett has so routinely delivered obvious untruths—such as that inflation had “come way down” at a moment when it had increased over the previous five months—that a genre of viral clip has emerged in which Hassett is fact-checked by the moderator.

Nor has Hassett’s remit been limited to economic policy. During Trump 2.0, he has gone so far as to endorse the president’s conspiratorial accusations against disfavored individuals. In July, he suggested that cost overruns on the renovation of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters could provide sufficient legal pretext for the president to fire Jerome Powell, saying that the Fed had “a lot to answer for” on the matter. In August, he called Trump’s flimsy mortgage-fraud accusations against Fed Governor Lisa Cook “serious” and implied that they could provide cause to fire her, as Trump did. (Subsequent reporting suggests that Cook did not list multiple homes as her primary residence in order to secure more favorable loan terms or receive tax exemptions, as the charges against her alleged. The question of whether Trump can fire Cook and other Fed officials is now before the Supreme Court.) When, in that same month, Trump responded to a negative jobs report by calling the data “rigged” and firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Hassett defended the decision, citing a supposed “partisan pattern” in the data and claiming that U.S. statistical agencies had a long history of manipulating numbers in favor of Democrats. “That moment was a turning point for me,” Baker said. “This wasn’t just another Trump talking point. It was a completely baseless attack on empirical reality. And Kevin just went along with it.”

Many of those who have long known and respected Hassett have begun to worry that he’s lost credibility as an independent thinker and economist—a dangerous possibility for someone who is leading the race to become the head of the country’s central bank. “I’ve known Kevin since he was a grad student, and I’ve long respected him as an economist, but I think he’s been too willing to sacrifice some of his professional credibility to maintain his standing in Trump world,” Gregory Mankiw, a conservative economist at Harvard University who served as CEA chairman under George W. Bush, told me. “To say I’m disappointed is a grotesque understatement,” Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist who previously served on Bill Clinton’s CEA and as the second-highest-ranking member of the Federal Reserve, told me. “When you say inflation is falling when it’s rising; when you favor firing Chair Powell for no good reason; when you attack the very data that we depend on to understand reality—you’ve crossed multiple lines with me and I think almost all economists.” (Both Blinder and Mankiw signed the 2017 letter supporting Hassett for the CEA.)

Even so, other economists are sanguine about Hassett’s possible appointment as Fed chair. Hassett might have to parrot Trump’s talking points in order to get the job, they argue, but once he has it, he will be free to make his own independent decisions, at which point his training as a mainstream economist will kick back in. “I don’t think Kevin has changed his views very much over the years,” a conservative economist who has known Hassett for several years and requested anonymity to speak freely, told me. “I think he’s figured out that there is a certain set of positions he has to take if he’s going to retain the confidence of the president so he can do his job effectively.”

In fact, several economists who support Hassett’s nomination told me they believe that his close personal relationship with Trump would be an asset as Fed chair. If Trump started putting pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates to 1 percent, as he has suggested on several occasions, Hassett could calmly explain to the president that this would likely backfire. With anyone else, Trump would surely lash out at such a suggestion, but because Trump knows and trusts Hassett, he will be far more likely to listen and respect the decision. “I think you need someone for the job who has the president’s confidence and trust,” Zandi said. “And I don’t think there are many people other than Kevin who have that.”

This view of Hassett would be more persuasive if he hadn’t published a manifesto heralding Trump as a messianic figure. Notably, The Drift was published back in November 2021, before Trump became the clear front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination; it would have gone to the printers at a time when Trump’s political career appeared to be over. Throughout the book, Hassett acknowledges that “president Trump is gone now” and urges his fellow Republicans to carry the flame forward. If this was all a ploy to manipulate Trump into someday appointing him Fed chair, it was one hell of a long con.

“He’s absolutely a true believer,” a conservative economist who has known Hassett for many years and requested anonymity to avoid retribution from the White House, told me. “You can’t get up every day and say things you know are wrong and that will hurt the nation and live with that cognitive dissonance. You believe what you need to believe or you quit.”

There’s no big mystery about what Trump wants the next Fed chair to do: immediately cut interest rates. Last month, the president deemed the central bank’s recent rate cut of a quarter of a percentage point “a rather small number” that should have been “at least doubled.” He has called for slashing rates to “1 percent and maybe lower than that” within a year. (They are currently about 3.75 percent.) “I won’t have anybody on the Federal Reserve that when you have good news, that means you automatically raise interest rates through the roof in order to kill inflation,” Trump recently told The Wall Street Journal. On Truth Social last month, the president was even more explicit: “Anybody that disagrees with me will never be the Fed Chairman!”

Hassett has said and done little to demonstrate that he would resist the president’s wishes. In a recent interview meant to calm the nerves of his critics, Hassett asserted that “the job of the Fed is to be independent,” but added that he “would be happy to talk with the president every day until both of us are dead.” He has also endorsed Trump’s call to “at least double” the current pace of cuts, and said that the Fed has “plenty of room” to cut even further.

The last time a president leaned on a loyal Fed chair to juice the economy with lower rates, the results were ugly. In 1970, Richard Nixon appointed one of his top economic advisers, Arthur Burns, to lead the central bank. He made clear that he expected looser monetary policy in the run-up to the 1972 elections, even as prices were rising. Burns delivered, and Nixon won reelection. But that move is now widely understood to have contributed to the double-digit inflation that roiled the country during the ’70s and ended only after a new Fed chair raised interest rates high enough to trigger a recession. “I worry Trump-Hassett would be even worse than Nixon-Burns,” Blinder, a historian of monetary policy, told me. “Burns at least put up some resistance to Nixon’s wishes.”

The chair of the Federal Reserve does not set interest rates unilaterally; they are determined by a 12-member board that votes eight times a year. One thing that’s changed under Trump, though, is the stability of the board from one administration to the next. When he moved to fire Cook, Trump was attempting to establish a broad right to dismiss Fed governors at will and nominate more pliant candidates to replace them.

If the Supreme Court hands Trump a victory in the Cook case, the president will gain effective control over the central bank. Although this eventuality is somewhat unlikely, the consequences could be disastrous. The Fed’s most important asset is its credibility: the belief, held by investors, bond traders, and business leaders, that the central bank will do whatever it takes to keep prices stable—even when that course of action is politically unpopular. Filling the central bank with partisans willing to lower rates on command would erode, if not completely decimate, that trust.

Recent history has not been kind to leaders who have embarked on a similar path. From 2019 to 2022, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan packed his country’s central bank with loyalists who dramatically cut interest rates even as prices were rising. In turn, inflation spiraled even higher, at one point reaching 85 percent. Foreign investors panicked, triggering a fire sale of Turkish government bonds. Long-term interest rates spiked, the value of the Turkish lira cratered, and the country appeared on the verge of hyperinflation. Erdoğan changed course in 2023 and brought in new central-bank leadership who jacked interest rates to nearly 50 percent and plunged the country into a recession in a desperate effort to restore credibility. More than two years later, unemployment remains high and inflation is still running at more than 30 percent. “I’ve always mocked those who warn of ‘bond vigilantes’ or say the U.S. is going to end up like Turkey or Argentina,” Baker told me. “But if Trump really did gain control of the Fed, that kind of scenario would suddenly feel a lot less ridiculous."

The powers of a Trumpian Fed would extend beyond control over interest rates. The central bank also decides which institutions can have access to the financial system; control of it would give Trump the power to “debank” enemies of his choosing, including major universities, companies he considers too “woke,” and left-leaning foundations. The Fed also has an emergency lending authority with almost zero practical constraints. “It’s an infinite money pit,” Lev Menand, a professor at Columbia Law School who previously worked for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, told me in September. Nothing can really stop the Fed “from lending trillions of dollars to the president’s priorities.”

If the Supreme Court rejects Trump’s firing of Cook, as is widely expected, the future of the Fed will be less grim, but hardly sunny. Hassett will then have to persuade a majority of the voting committee to go along with his plans. Burns, who was among the most famous academic economists of his era, was able to pull that off. There’s no guarantee Hassett would be able to do the same.

Even so, as the central bank’s voting board shifted from a technocratic body guided by consensus to a partisan battleground between those attempting to do the president’s bidding and those trying to hold the line, its decisions would become far less predictable. Investors might question whether a divided Fed could successfully navigate a future financial crisis or inflationary spike. In response, they might begin to sell some of their U.S. Treasury holdings, which would, in turn, send interest rates on car, home, and student loans even higher. (The interest rate on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds rose when Hassett emerged as the front-runner early last month, and several major bond investors have expressed concerns over his appointment.) “The Fed is widely viewed as the anchor of stability for the entire U.S. economy—the entire global economy, in fact,” Blinder said. “So if the Fed starts acting erratically, that’s a recipe for all kinds of market volatility.”

For most of his career, Kevin Hassett would no doubt have agreed with that analysis. The fate of the economy could soon depend on whether he still does.

On a chilly day before Christmas, Teresa Rivas helped a tween boy pick out a new winter coat. “Get the bigger one, the one with the waterproof layer, mijo,” she said, before helping him pull it onto his string-bean frame. Rivas provides guidance counseling at Owen Goodnight Middle School in San Marcos, Texas. She talks with students about their goals and helps if they’re struggling in class. She’s also a trained navigator placed there by a nonprofit called Communities in Schools.

The idea behind CIS and other “community school” programs is that students can’t succeed academically if they’re struggling at home. “Between kindergarten and 12th grade, kids spend only 20 percent of their time” in a classroom, Rob Watson, the executive director of the EdRedesign Lab at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, told me. If America wants kids to thrive, he said, it has to consider the 80 percent. Educators and school administrators in San Marcos, a low-income community south of Austin, agreed. “Tests and academics are very important,” Joe Mitchell, the principal of Goodnight Middle School, told me. “But they are secondary sometimes, given what these kids’ lives are like away from here.”

Along with mediating conflicts and doing test prep, Rivas helps kids’ families sign up for public benefits. She arranges for the nonprofit to cover rent payments. She sets up medical appointments, and keeps refrigerators and gas tanks full.

A new study demonstrates that such efforts have long-term effects. Benjamin Goldman, an assistant professor of economics at Cornell, and Jamie Gracie, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard, evaluated data on more than 16 million Texas students over two decades, examining data from the Census Bureau and IRS, as well as state records on academic outcomes. They found that the introduction of CIS led to higher test scores, lower truancy rates, and fewer suspensions in Texas schools. The program bumped up high-school graduation rates by 5.2 percent and matriculation rates at two-year colleges by 9.1 percent. At age 27, students who had attended a CIS school earned $1,140 more a year than students who had not.

The program’s impact is “quite big,” Gracie told me: Spending $1,000 on CIS increased student earnings at age 27 by $400, whereas spending $1,000 on smaller class sizes increased student earnings by $40. The researchers estimated that every $3,000 in CIS investment would increase income-tax revenue by $7,000.

Although contemporary education policy has focused intently on standardized tests, student and teacher tracking, and other accountability measures, the CIS study suggests that the United States could bolster achievement by providing more social support too. “You could have the world’s greatest teacher,” Goldman told me. “It’s only going to matter so much if you’re not actually showing up to school.” Watson said he hoped the study would lead policy makers to finance community-school programs in every low-income neighborhood. “If you care about morals and social justice, there’s something here for you,” he said. “If you care about good fiscal and economic policy, there’s something here for you.”

But the country is veering in the other direction. The White House has slashed hundreds of millions of dollars from a free-school-meal initiative, ended a $1 billion grant covering mental-health counseling, and revoked $170 million from the federal community-schools program, which helps cover the salaries of hundreds of workers like Rivas. Other whole-child initiatives might lose financing if they are found to fall under the Trump administration’s DEI rubric. At the same time, the White House is reducing financial support for low-income families, cutting more than $1 trillion from SNAP and Medicaid.

The United States wants schools to act as a “great equalizer,” yet socioeconomic differences among students remain the central drivers of student outcomes. Community schools can’t prevent homelessness, pay for health insurance, or stop parents from getting deported; they cannot construct a strong safety net. Still, they can help to close the gap.

A decade ago, the San Marcos school district’s dropout rate was higher than the state average, and its standardized-test scores lower. In 2016, Michael Cardona was named superintendent and tasked with a turnaround mission.

“We have great—amazing—kids,” Cardona told me. But more than 100 students were homeless in the 8,000-student district. “That’s a lot for a town with one high school,” he said. Seven students had died by suicide in recent years. Students had been involved in 282 recorded incidents of domestic violence over an 18-month period. “Typically, it was mom trying to discipline the kid or grandma trying to discipline the kid, taking away the cellphone, then the kid beats up the family member and gets put in jail,” Cardona said.

A visit to a fifth-grade gifted-and-talented classroom put the crisis into even sharper relief for him. Cardona asked the students a softball question: What could he do for them as superintendent? One asked if he could help keep their father out of prison. Another wondered if he could stop their mother from partying every weekend. Afterward, he sat in his truck and cried. “These are the students identified as the best of the best,” he said. “We’ve got a mental-health issue in this district unlike anything we’ve ever seen.”

Cardona decided to focus not only on test scores and remediation measures but also on social support. The district expanded its health-care and counseling initiatives, putting a focus on early intervention. And it reached out to CIS, which offered to place a navigator, such as Rivas, in every school.

CIS is a half century old and works with 2 million children in 26 states. (It’s not a pilot, in other words; it’s three times the size of Head Start.) The nonprofit has a few unusual qualities. For one, it doesn’t apply rigid criteria or means tests in determining who gets help, and doesn’t provide a set menu of benefits to students and families. The model is adaptable. In some districts, navigators focus on violence prevention or absenteeism. In San Marcos, they focus on behavioral health. Inside schools, CIS staff members created lamp-lit, womblike rooms, stocked with fidget toys and snacks, where kids can calm down and talk about their feelings. Some middle-school girls told me that Rivas helped them with “drama and stuff”—meaning “girls fighting over boys.” One boy who was having trouble sleeping and had a 69 average in math told me that Rivas was helping get his eyes shut and his grades up. “You only need one more point!” she said, beaming.

CIS workers help families navigate existing public programs. “The traditional economist view would have been, Just give people cash. They’ll figure out what to do with it,” Goldman told me. But decades of studies have found that families in crisis don’t know that help is out there, possess limited capacity to research complex social-safety-net initiatives, and are averse to signing up for benefits, given the stigma. Community schools take paperwork away from stressed-out families and put it on trained employees.

CIS workers also come with a pool of funds to distribute. A freshman named Valencia Ayub told me about a time when her mother had lost a job at Dollar Tree, and her father had lost his job as an electrician. She considered going “straight to work” to help her younger sisters, rather than applying to college. CIS sent two checks, one for $500 and one for $800, to cover the family’s rent. School systems don’t have to make these payments themselves; in general, CIS is inexpensive for school districts to offer because it uses a mix of public, private, and philanthropic funding.

These kinds of wraparound supports keep kids in class, reduce the number of behavioral incidents, and make sure students are capable of learning when they sit down at their desks; as Goldman and Gracie’s study showed, they also have long-term effects. For those reasons, “there’s been a significant expansion in terms of systematic initiatives and interventions,” Anna Maier of the Learning Policy Institute told me; school districts, states, and individual institutions have built out their social-work capacity. Still, the country underinvests in kids and schools, creating achievement gaps that classroom teachers struggle to close and preventing children from reaching their full potential. The Trump administration’s withdrawing community-school financing as it slashes the safety net stands to make the problem worse.

In San Marcos, at least, the school district is seeing improvements. Kids feel safer, and the number of violent incidents has fallen. “At the end of the day,” Cardona told me, “that’s what I look at.”

        Updated at 11:07 a.m. ET on January 30, 2026

In the waning heat of last summer, freshly back in my office at a major research university, I found myself considering the higher-education hellscape that had lately descended upon the nation. I’d spent months reporting on the Trump administration’s attacks on universities for The Atlantic, speaking with dozens of administrators, faculty, and students about the billions of dollars in cuts to public funding for research and the resulting collapse of “college life.”At the same time, I’d been chronicling the spread of AI-powered chatbots that have already changed undergraduates forever.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

Initially, I surveyed the situation from the safe distance of a journalist who happens to also be a career professor and university administrator. I saw myself as an envoy between America’s college campuses and its citizens, telling the stories of the people whose lives had been shattered by these transformations. By the summer, though, that safe distance had collapsed back on me. The wave of campus crises was causing immediate effects in my own academic life. People I knew were losing their jobs. Yearslong projects were stranded. I heard from students cheating their way through every class with AI, and from faculty following suit. I watched professors lash out at other disciplines with misplaced blame. I listened to friends discuss whether they should send their kids to school abroad. I had personally devoted 25 years to higher education. Now it felt like the whole idea of the university might be ending.

Sitting in my office, I began searching for some cause for hope, some reason to believe that higher ed could stanch the damage for the next generation of students. It occurred to me that I’d been hearing less despair from colleagues at certain smaller schools that offer undergraduate study in the “liberal-arts tradition,” a broad and flexible approach to education that values developing the person over professional training. I wondered if these schools—especially the wealthy ones that cluster near the top of national rankings—might enjoy some natural insulation from the fires raging through the nation’s research universities.

I texted, emailed, telephoned, and Zoomed with friends in higher-education leadership. Current and former heads of both research universities and liberal-arts colleges confirmed my intuition: Well-resourced and prestigious small colleges are less exposed in almost every way to the crises that higher ed faces.

To dig deeper, I decided to embark on a fact-finding mission in the guise of a traditional college tour. In November, I went to visit four elite liberal-arts colleges—Amherst, Davidson, Smith, and Vassar—where I joined prospective students and their parents for their campus tours, sat in on classes, and spoke with undergraduates, professors, and administrators. Might schools such as these emerge as the accidental winners of the war on universities?

I came to Amherst College too late in the autumn to observe peak foliage, but amber and ocher remnants still spread across the Pioneer Valley in western Massachusetts. This is the scene Emily Dickinson, a local resident, would have taken in before composing the lines, “The maple wears a gayer scarf, / The field a scarlet gown.”

My tour began at the Colonial Revival residence that serves as the school’s admissions office, but we soon arrived in the new science building, a modern structure with oddball green furnishings. Nate Scharf, our sophomore guide, sat us down and gestured toward a small classroom where he had taken a psychology class. At a typical research university, an undergraduate course like this would meet inside a lecture hall, perhaps with separate breakout sections for discussion led by graduate students. But neither Scharf nor any of his classmates had ever been exposed to this scenario—because Amherst, like most liberal-arts colleges, has no graduate students.

No graduate students: The American public may not fully grasp the implications of this statement. At a university, grad students may end up leading class discussions, but that’s only part of the story. Their presence on a campus telegraphs a more important truth: that in terms of mission, teaching undergrads comes second to research.

And at most universities, grad students play a crucial role within the research system: They perform the frontline work of science. Faculty members get federal grants, which are used to pay for doctoral students, who in turn serve as laboratory staff. Professors’ feeling of worth and productivity may be a function of how many doctoral students they advise—because that helps determine how many studies they can carry out, how many papers they can publish, and what sorts of new grants they can win to keep the process going. This endless competition is a major feature of the modern university—whether it’s an elite private school (such as Princeton or Duke), a public flagship (such as the University of Michigan or UC Berkeley), or a land-grant institution (such as Texas A&M or Virginia Tech).

A school like Amherst, though, which has no doctoral programs whatsoever, is free of the rat race of research productivity and expenditure. As these colleges like to point out, that’s good for undergrads, because faculty must focus on education. The lack of doctoral research programs also makes the schools more resilient to bullying from Washington. In 2025, the Trump administration made a point of suspending hundreds of millions of dollars in research grants to Columbia, Harvard, Northwestern, and other schools. It also threatened to impose a tighter limit on what are called “indirect costs”—the portion of each grant that covers all the broader costs of running a large enterprise for research. With so much funding endangered all at once, targeted universities had little choice but to negotiate—which is to say, to accede to some portion of the Trump administration’s demands.

At Amherst, this level of pressure simply couldn’t be applied. In 2024, the college took in around $3 million from all of its federal research grants put together. (For comparison: Washington University in St. Louis, where I teach, received $731 million that year from the National Institutes of Health alone.) Christopher Durr, an associate professor of chemistry, told me that his research is “designed to be done mostly in-house,” by which he means without external funding, and with the help of undergraduates. He studies biodegradable plastics in a lab that is mostly funded by the college itself, and he gets no research money at all from the federal government. Settling into an Eames-style chair in his office, I asked him what indirect-cost rate Amherst applies to its grants, and he said he didn’t know—an innocence that would be unheard of at a research university.

The research that can be done at a small liberal-arts college, with its more modest labs and equipment, is necessarily constrained. Even with Amherst’s generosity, Durr said “there’s a limit” to how far he can push his research. In truth, the most important scientific and medical discoveries aren’t likely to be made at a place like Amherst or Smith, the nearby women’s college, which tend to pay their own students to work on faculty research. But this need not be a limitation for undergraduates. The conditions that produce landmark discoveries are not necessarily the same ones that produce a serious education.

Perched along the shores of North Carolina’s Lake Norman, in the Charlotte suburbs at the northern edge of Mecklenburg County, Davidson College’s location is a crossroads for red and blue America. In the last election, two-thirds of Mecklenburg’s voters chose Kamala Harris; just a mile up the road, in Iredell County, two-thirds of voters went for Donald Trump.

Connor Hines, the current student-body president and a senior majoring in political science, is a self-described moderate conservative who grew up in the area. He told me that he chose to come to Davidson in part because its students are able to disagree with one another in thoughtful ways. His good friend Nina Worley, an educational-studies major who was raised in Harlem, said the same. “I knew that to be a good advocate for education policy, I needed to meet a Republican for the first time,” Worley told me. She and Hines do not see eye to eye on everything—the two do not agree, for example, on the policies of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But they said they carry out that disagreement with respect.

According to higher education’s many critics on the right, elite universities have tried to stifle disagreement; allegedly they’re pushing students into echo chambers instead of broadening their minds. The Trump administration made this accusation central to its war on research universities: With billions of dollars in withheld grants as leverage, it initially pressured nine institutions into signing an agreement, called the “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,” that would commit them to “fostering a vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus” and protecting conservative viewpoints.

In the meantime, under local pressure, reactionary speech suppression is taking hold at public universities: Many schools, including Auburn and the University of Michigan, have shut down their DEI offices; Texas A&M censored courses based on race and gender content; and Indiana University halted the print edition of the student newspaper, an act its journalists said amounted to censorship. Some private schools, including Columbia, Northwestern, and Cornell, have struck deals to restore funding that variously included provisions regarding civil-rights standards, disciplinary processes, DEI rubrics in admissions and hiring, and policies related to sex and gender identity.

Davidson, which, like Amherst, is far less exposed than research universities to the threat of withheld money, has not been explicitly asked to sign the compact. (Nor have any other liberal-arts schools, including the ones I visited.) Chris Marsicano, an associate professor of education studies who had introduced me to Hines and Worley, told me that the school was way ahead of the national conversation on campus dialogue in any case. In 2019, it created a Deliberative Citizenship Initiative, which runs programming to help students and faculty engage on issues about which disagreement is likely, such as immigration and border control. “We’re the hipsters of civil discourse,” Marsicano said. “We were doing it before it was cool.”

Certainly these sorts of efforts can be found at lots of universities: Ohio State has a Civil Discourse for Citizenship initiative, for instance, and WashU has just launched an Ordered Liberty Project, which includes associated coursework on the topic of “disagreement.” But they may be most likely to succeed when they’re applied to smaller student bodies, like Davidson’s. At lunch in the school’s campus commons, I watched President Douglas Hicks greet a dozen students by name. My tour guide explained that students and faculty tend to mingle there; in fact, they can’t avoid it, because everyone eats in the same place. Some might find this stifling or claustrophobic, but being forced to live together day by day may also stimulate openness and mutual respect. “You can’t hide,” Hicks told me.

At a small liberal-arts college, where a cohort may number fewer than 500 people, admissions officers can also take a stronger hand in assembling a group of students who match the institution’s culture and its vibe while also having very different backgrounds. And the fact that almost everyone at a small liberal-arts college tends to live on campus, or very close to it, adds to the sense of intimacy. “It’s just much easier for me to get to know faculty here, much easier for me to get to know students, much easier for me to hear what’s on their minds,” Amherst’s president, Michael Elliott, told me.

One effect of this, he said, is that professors actually show up to faculty meetings to talk about the future of their institution. They participate in budgeting conversations, debate the creation of majors, and approve new courses. This is decidedly not the norm at many larger universities, where professors may not see these meetings as a core part of the job, and where administrators can ignore them altogether. (Last year, Northwestern reached a settlement with the Trump administration despite 98 percent of its voting faculty having recommended otherwise.) Elliott admits that all of this faculty participation can make the college move more slowly in decision making. But done right, faculty governance is a form of healthy campus discourse, too.

Perhaps no threat to higher ed is more acute than the recent, rapid spread of generative AI. “It’s just about crushed me,” one college teacher told me in the spring of 2023. “I fell in love with teaching, and I have loved my time in the classroom, but with ChatGPT, everything feels pointless.”

The remarkable test-taking, paper-writing power of AI is hardly under control at liberal-arts colleges such as Amherst or Davidson. But in my conversations with students and faculty, I witnessed a struggle to understand and respond to it with greater earnestness and complexity than I have encountered elsewhere in higher education. In my experience, students and faculty at research universities tend to have a Manichaean view of the technology: Either AI is an existential threat to be cast out, or a vital tool to be embraced as a professional virtue. Little room is left for nuance, which means that little progress can be made on shaping policy.

Davidson prides itself on having an unusually deliberate honor code. (Students I spoke with said this code is taken so seriously that they can leave their belongings anywhere on campus without fear that they will be stolen.) But the seductions of ChatGPT are hard to resist, and Marsicano noted that the college has seen an increase in code violations due to AI. That sounded like less of a problem here than elsewhere, though. If the students are availing themselves of the technology, then at least they appear to be doing so with some reservations.

Hines told me that he uses AI tools, though not for academic work. Worley said she’s avoided AI so far, because “I’m still struggling with what makes me comfortable about it and what doesn’t.” At Davidson, each professor can set their own approach to AI in the classroom, but that can be confusing. In the meantime, Worley and her roommates ponder what the rules should be. They ask, for instance: If it’s now okay to have AI write your emails for you, why is that okay? And they talk about AI data centers’ environmental costs. “Everyone’s wrestling with it,” she said.

Learning how to wrestle with an issue like AI, which is ambiguous and undecided, is the whole point of an education undertaken in the liberal tradition. It’s also made easier in a context where faculty-to-student ratios can be much smaller than they are at even elite research universities. (At a school like Davidson or Amherst, some classrooms will contain just a handful of students and a professor—a scenario in which siphoning work through Claude would not be easy.) Carina Cole, a Vassar media-studies student, told me that a supportive culture on campus also makes it possible to treat AI with greater care. Her fellow students are more likely to ask one another for help than turn to technology, she said. But Worley admitted that the situation feels fragile no matter what: “I’m holding on for dear life.”

At Amherst, I sat down with Matthew McGann, the dean of admission and financial aid. I asked how his school stacked up against the nation’s most prestigious universities. If a student also gains admission to Yale, do they go there instead? “They do,” he said. Amherst has a sterling reputation, but it still cannot compete against a famous Ivy.

The relative obscurity of even the best small liberal-arts colleges may be helping them to avoid the Trump administration’s war on higher ed. But that doesn’t mean that they’re immune from any risk of being targeted. Haverford College, in Pennsylvania, for example, has been made the subject of a civil-rights investigation for allegedly failing to address anti-Semitic harassment against Jewish students. (This is the same charge, and the same government action, that has been directed or threatened against Columbia, UCLA, Stanford, Cornell, Rutgers, and many other big universities.) Haverford may not rely on the federal government for giant research grants, but even just defending itself against investigation would be costly, as would, say, losing federal Pell Grants that subsidize low-income students.

Small colleges’ endowments could also be attacked, even if the schools are never targeted specifically. In 2025, Congress voted to increase the tax on endowment income, which private colleges and universities draw on for financial aid, from 1.4 percent to as much as 8 percent. (The wealthiest liberal-arts colleges spend a large portion of their endowment earnings to fund students who can’t afford to spend up to $100,000 a year to attend.) For the moment, institutions with fewer than 3,000 tuition-paying students—which means most liberal-arts colleges—are exempted from this increase, so their budgets remain untouched. But that could change.

Then there is the nagging question of practicality. Even if you believe that a liberal-arts college offers the best education, going to school to learn how to think might seem like a luxury today. In the end, you’ll still need to earn some kind of living. If the paths for getting there—which may include postgraduate study in a doctoral program or professional school—are diminishing, then college itself will follow suit.

Still, after spending several weeks on my tour of wealthy, liberal-arts colleges, I grew to think that the pitch they’re making to prospective students and their parents for the fall of 2026 was convincing. All things considered, when the time comes, I might rather see my own preteen daughter attend a school like Amherst or Davidson, Smith or Vassar, than a research university such as my own. The form of higher ed that they provide seems poised to be the most resilient in the years to come.

In a way, that resilience may pass on to the students who attend them. On my last night in western Massachusetts, I was set up to have dinner with a group of graduating Amherst seniors. By all measures, these were tremendously successful young adults. Hedley Lawrence-Apfelbaum intends to complete a fellowship at the University of Oxford on his way to Harvard Law. Ayres Warren, who has already published a journal article on breast-cancer disparities, will pursue a career in environmental health-care management. Shane Dillon is plotting out a career in politics. All three of them told me they were worried about their futures—not because they had attended Amherst instead of Yale or Emory or Michigan State, but because the world seems so uncertain on the whole.

These seniors weren’t panicking, though—this was very clear. “We’ll see,” Dillon said when I asked what was next, what he feared, and what he hoped for. I’ve known a lot of brilliant undergraduates during the course of my career at research universities. Some have become wealthy in business; others have become famous; still more have made the world better through research and invention. But Dillon and the other students whom I met during my college tour struck me as being unusually attuned to the facts of their predicament. They were already living in the thickness of their own lives, aware of who they are and not just what they might become. They seemed to understand, by virtue of the education they’d received, that uncertainty is to be expected, and that the future lasts a long time.

        This article is adapted from Until the Last Gun Is Silent: A Story of Patriotism, the Vietnam War, and the Fight to Save America’s Soul (published January 2026 by Viking, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC, all rights reserved).

Dwight “Skip” Johnson, 19, returned home from his shift at a General Motors plant in Detroit one humid June evening in 1966 to find a letter awaiting him. He was to report to the Greyhound bus terminal on East Congress Street the following month for induction into the US military. “Willful failure to report at the place and hour of the day named in this Order subjects the violator to fine and imprisonment,” the letter warned.

More than 8 million Americans served in the armed forces during the Vietnam era, with about 3 million deployed in Southeast Asia, including more than 300,000 Black Americans. For a time, Skip would be among the most well-known. As a tank driver in the 69th Armor Regiment, he earned the Medal of Honor for fighting his way out of an ambush. He was celebrated by politicians and became an Army recruiter, until his life started to unravel. He slept fitfully, beset by nightmares and bleeding ulcers. Out of work, bills started to pill up. “Vietnam Hero Collapses Under Glory Strain,” read the headline in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch after an attempted robbery in Detroit ended Skip’s life in April 1971. Psychiatrists Robert Jay Lifton and Chaim Shatan, who pioneered the study of post-traumatic stress disorder, identified Skip as the first high-profile example of the war’s psychological toll. He came to symbolize the complicated legacy of a generation.

I have been thinking back on Skip’s story—which I recount in my new book about Black soldiers who served in Vietnam—as the Trump White House and its so-called Department of War move to disparage the historical and contemporary military service of Black Americans.

Shortly after taking office, in February 2025, President Donald Trump abruptly fired General Charles “CQ” Brown, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as part of a purge of military leaders who advance diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. In March, Arlington National Cemetery scrubbed from its website educational materials about the history of Black service members, including the Tuskegee Airmen and even General Colin Powell, the first Black Joint Chiefs chairman. In July, the Army updated its grooming standards to phase out waivers that allowed soldiers diagnosed with Pseudofolliculitis barbae, or ingrown hairs, to grow beards. “Of course, this is racially motivated, there is no tactical reason,” a senior noncommissioned officer told the news site Military.com. The article cited an estimate from the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology that up to 60 percent of Black men have the condition.

With these and other petty moves executed by Pete Hegseth, Trump’s loyalist secretary of “war,” the White House and Pentagon appear strangely determined to undermine, and even erase the evidence of, Black patriotism—not to mention the military’s hard-won reputation as an institution that embraces the talents and capabilities of all Americans.

Such efforts, at a time when the military is struggling to attract eligible recruits, amount to a colossal own goal. In the 50 years since the end of the Vietnam War, Black Americans have volunteered and reenlisted at higher rates than the general population. That’s not a talent pool you want to alienate. Per the most recent data available, Black Americans make up almost 14 percent of the civilian population, but 17 percent of active-duty service members across all branches. In the Army, nearly a quarter of all active-duty enlisted personnel are Black—and Black women make up 36 percent of all enlisted women.

Against this backdrop, it is important to recognize individual stories of Black valor and sacrifice, such as Skip Johnson’s. The volunteers who step up today—of all racial and ethnic backgrounds—have much in common with Skip: young, working-class men and women from Rust Belt cities and rural towns, for whom military service offers greater promise than the alternatives.

Back in the summer of 1966, Skip was an 18-year-old who had just graduated from Northwestern High School in Detroit. Like other men his age, he was required to register for the Selective Service. More than 230,000 men ages 18 to 26 had been drafted for military service in 1965, more than double the prior year. Skip knew several guys from his neighborhood who were required to report for duty. He had been anticipating the draft for months, unsure how he would feel when the notice finally arrived. Now, staring at the letter that would change the trajectory of his life, he thought of his mother and younger brother. After his stepfather, a Jamaican immigrant farmworker, was deported a decade earlier, he’d taken on adult responsibilities. His family relied on him, and he liked being relied on. If he were sent to Vietnam, who would take care of them?

He was also scared. Reports of US casualties were everywhere—on the evening news, in magazines, splashed across front pages. What worried him most was how many of the fallen looked like him. The disproportionate number of Black servicemen killed in the early stages of the Vietnam War brought a particular dread.

Early in 1966, the Pentagon released data showing that Black troops made up just under 15 percent of the Army in Vietnam but accounted for more than 18 percent of US military deaths there between 1961 and 1965. At the time, Black people were roughly 11 percent of the population. “Negroes Dying Faster than Whites in Vietnam,” read a headline in the New York Amsterdam News, a leading Black newspaper. “It is not likely to give comfort to Negroes battling to gain equality on the home front,” its editors declared, “to learn that they are being given more than an equal opportunity to die for their country on the battlefield of Vietnam.”

This disparity gave critics of the war new ammunition. They noted that less than 2 percent of local draft board members were Black, and 23 states had no Black board members at all. In Louisiana, the grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan had led the state’s all-white draft board for a decade, until NAACP protests forced his removal. In Georgia, the chairman of the Atlanta draft board publicly referred to Julian Bond, the civil rights activist and George state representative, as “that nigger,” lamenting, “We sure let him slip through our fingers.”

These draft boards wielded enormous power, including the ability to determine who qualified for draft deferments—with student deferments often based on scores from the Selective Service College Qualification Test. “The draft deferment test brings the circle of racial discrimination full cycle,” argued Rep. Adam Clayton Powell Jr., a Democratic congressman who represented Harlem. Powell charged that standardized testing favored white, middle-class students. “First, we provide inferior education for Black students. Next, we give them a series of tests which many will flunk because of an inferior education. Then we pack these academic failures off to war.”

Among the Black men already serving, too, there was a growing unease that they were essentially cannon fodder. “I think we’re being killed off,” a Marine private stationed in Dong Ha told the Washington Evening Star in May 1968. “I think we’re being used.”

At the same time, some Black leaders offered more optimistic interpretations of the outsize role Black troops were playing in the war. “I feel good about it,” Lt. Colonel George Shoffer, one of the Army’s highest-ranking Black officers, told the New York Times in March 1968. “Not that I like the bloodshed, but the performance of the Negro in Vietnam tends to offset the fact that the Negro wasn’t considered worthy of being a front-line soldier in other wars.” Whitney Young, executive director of the National Urban League, echoed that sentiment after visiting Vietnam at President Lyndon Johnson’s request. A World War II veteran, Young argued in his newspaper column that “race is irrelevant” in Vietnam and that in “the muck and mire of a war-torn land, colored soldiers fight and die courageously as representatives of all America.”

The numbers seemed to support this notion of Black courage—but also a lack of opportunity back home. In 1966, two-thirds of Black Army soldiers reenlisted when their contracts expired, compared with 20 percent of white soldiers. And in a Harris poll that year, two-thirds of Black respondents believed Black Americans had better chances to advance in the military than in civilian life.

On June 30, 1966, days before Skip was scheduled to report for duty, three soldiers from Fort Hood, Texas, made national headlines by refusing to deploy to Vietnam. The “Fort Hood Three”—Private First Class James Johnson, a Black man from Harlem; Private Dennis Mora, a Puerto Rican from Spanish Harlem; and Private David Samas, the son of Lithuanian and Italian immigrants from California—stood before a bank of reporters and television cameras to read a joint statement.

“We represent in our backgrounds a cross section of the Army and of America,” they began. “We speak as American soldiers. We have been in the Army long enough to know that we are not the only GIs who feel as we do. Large numbers of men in the service either do not understand this war or are against it.”

They condemned the conflict as “unjust, immoral, and illegal” and urged other soldiers to follow their lead. “Contrary to what the Pentagon believes,” they declared, “cannon fodder can talk.”

Their public defiance—which was the first time enlisted men openly refused orders to Vietnam—shocked the military and inspired antiwar activists. Folk singer Pete Seeger wrote a protest song, “Ballad of the Fort Hood Three,” in their honor. They were court-martialed, dishonorably discharged, and sentenced to three years of hard labor.

Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara felt like he knew Skip Johnson—even though he had never heard of him. To McNamara, “Skip Johnson” was of a type: one of thousands of young men from poor and working-class backgrounds for whom military service could serve as a lifeline. At a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in New York in August 1966, McNamara announced Project 100,000, a sweeping initiative to induct 100,000 men into the military each year—most of whom had previously failed the Armed Forces Qualification Test.

McNamara cast the project as a fusion of military necessity and social uplift that he framed as an extension of President Johnson’s war on poverty. He declared that tens of thousands of men, “most of them with ‘poverty-encrusted’ backgrounds, would be ‘salvaged’ for military duty.” The program, he claimed, would “rehabilitate the nation’s subterranean poor” and “cure them of the idleness, ignorance, and apathy” that defined their lives.

“The poor of America…can be given an opportunity to serve in their country’s defense,” McNamara said, “and they can be given an opportunity to return to civilian life with skills and aptitudes which for them and their families will reverse the downward spiral of human decay.”

The logic behind Project 100,000 drew heavily on the thinking of political scientist, scholar, and White House adviser Daniel Patrick Moynihan. In 1963, Moynihan wrote “One Third of a Nation: A Report on Young Men Found Unqualified for Military Service,” which argued that mass disqualification from the draft reflected a deeper national crisis. Two years later, his controversial report “The Negro Family: The Case for National Action” advanced the theory that entrenched family behavior patterns and family instability—not structural inequality—had created a “culture of poverty” in Black communities.

Moynihan saw the military—“a world run by strong men and unquestioned authority”—as the antidote. “The biggest opportunity to do something about Negro youth has been right under our noses all the time,” he argued in an internal White House memo. “Very possibly our best hope is seriously to use the armed forces as a socializing experience for the poor, until somehow their environment begins turning out equal citizens.”

Moynihan believed expanding military service could directly reduce racial disparities in employment. “If 100,000 nonwhite men were added to the Armed Forces and resulted in a decrease of 100,000 in the unemployed, that unemployment rate would drop from 11.5 percent to 6.4 percent,” he calculated. At a time when Coretta Scott King—who is rarely celebrated as the leading antiwar activist she was—along with husband Martin Luther King Jr. and other activists charged that the war was draining resources from domestic programs, Moynihan and McNamara urged the president to view the military as an anti-poverty tool.

Over five years, from 1966 to 1971, McNamara’s initiative brought more than 300,000 men into the military who otherwise would have been deemed unfit for service. Nearly 40 percent of these “New Standards Men” were Black. “The plain fact is that our Project 100,000 is succeeding beyond even our most hopeful expectations,” McNamara told the National Association of Education Broadcasters in November 1967.

For the Johnson White House, the program was appealing because it expanded the draft pool without politically risky steps like activating reservists or drafting large numbers of college students—measures that could have ignited even more antiwar protests and congressional pushback. Instead, military recruiters scoured the country for more Skip Johnsons: poor and working-class men of all races.

Project 100,000 deepened the inequalities of a draft system that already favored families with money, education, and connections. In Queens, New York, for example, a wealthy real estate developer’s eldest son who would one day be president secured five Vietnam draft deferments—four because he was in college and the last based on a diagnosis of bone spurs, which the doctor’s daughters later claimed had been fabricated as a “favor” to the father. In Detroit’s wealthy suburbs, parents set up businesses in Canada and put their kids in charge to qualify them for deferments. Just across the Detroit River lay safety, but for Skip, fleeing to Canada was unthinkable.

“We’re setting up a kind of class warfare,” Lt. Colonel Jim Williams later told journalist James Fallows. “I wonder about the morality of a nation that lets the disadvantaged do the fighting.” Even Army General William Westmoreland came to describe the draft policy as “discriminatory and undemocratic,” resulting, he wrote in Military Review in 1979, “in the war being fought mainly by the poor man’s son.”

Some young soldiers rationalized the danger of combat in monetary terms. Roger Harris, who went from Roxbury—the heart of Boston’s Black community—to the Marines, remembered thinking: “If I die, at least my mother would get $10,000 life insurance benefit and be able to buy a house. She’d be rich.”

Across the country, casualty data reflected stories of opportunity—or its lack. In Illinois, men from working-class neighborhoods where the median family income was less than $5,000 were four times more likely to be killed in Vietnam than those from areas where family incomes exceeded $15,000. (The median family income in 1967 was $8,000.) In Beallsville, Ohio—a rural town of just 450 residents—15 young men went to Vietnam. Several did not return. “They got our boys because this is a poor town and the boys can’t afford to go to college,” Mayor Ben Gramlich told the New York Times in 1969, after the town’s sixth military funeral.

Thomas Edison High School in North Philadelphia—a working-class neighborhood not unlike Skip’s own—lost more than 50 young men over the course of the war, the highest-known death toll of any high school in the country. At Northwestern High, each month seemed to bring news of another former classmate wounded or killed: Wayne V. Glenn, hit by shrapnel in March 1966; Charles H. Shelton, died from gunshot wounds in June 1966; George H. Dorsey Jr., killed in Thi Ninh in February 1967.

Project 100,000 accelerated the losses. “When McNamara says he is going to draft 30 percent of the Black people out of the ghettos,” Stokely Carmichael told an audience at Morgan State University, “baby, that is nothing but urban removal.”

Skip was one of 382,000 men drafted in 1966—more than in any other year of the Vietnam War. As the Pentagon increasingly turned to poor and working-class teenagers to fill its ranks, the average draftee looked more like a Black kid from the Detroit projects than not.

Skip wasn’t yet 20 when he left Fort Knox for Vietnam. He had not asked to become a symbol—but in many ways, he was. He stood for a generation whose lives would be forever shaped by a war they did not choose.

On January 15, 1968, Skip’s 353rd day in Vietnam, his tank platoon was escorting a convoy of supply trucks from Kontum to Dak To when rockets fired by North Vietnamese troops slammed into the lead tanks. Amid the ambush, he struggled to rescue crewmates and defend himself, armed only with a pistol. “Specialist Johnson’s conspicuous gallantry at the risk of his life is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit on himself and the United States Army,” Secretary of the Army Stanley Resor said when Skip was awarded the Medal of Honor in a White House ceremony on November 19, 1968.

In Until the Last Gun Is Silent, I set out to tell Skip’s story. Friends, classmates, teachers, and his former pastor described an inquisitive and kind young man with a rich singing voice. I spoke with a dozen veterans from his unit, the 69th Armor, who remembered his laugh, his selflessness, and the tight bonds that formed in his four-man tank crews. His widow, Katrina May, a spirited septuagenarian, told me how, as teenagers, Skip flirted with her for months before she finally agreed to go out with him. During his deployment, they wrote letters back and forth, making each other laugh and falling in love through the mail—an epistolary romance, like a Jane Austen novel set in Detroit. Katrina stood by Skip when he returned home, through moments of celebration and spirals of despair. She spoke of a young man who had his whole life ahead of him—until he didn’t.

Like so many Vietnam veterans, Skip struggled with unemployment and the psychological wounds of war. On April 29, 1971, he was shot and killed in an attempted robbery at a Detroit convenience store. Across the country, people who had never met Skip found meaning in his story. After a Memorial Day parade in Middletown, Connecticut, Korean War veteran Raymond Dzialo encouraged the crowd to care for the “war living” who struggled upon returning from Vietnam. “There are thousands of war veterans who are equally as hopeless as Dwight Johnson,” he said. Veterans found job training and drug treatment lacking, he argued: “We are thankless for the duty they have performed.”

Dzialo, who had read about Skip’s death in a newspaper days earlier, said the lack of support he encountered after the war was a stain on America’s pride. “We must honor the war living with jobs, with respect, with care, with thanks, and above all, with love.”

Psychiatrists Robert Jay Lifton, Chaim Shatan, and their colleagues were also keenly interested in Skip’s story. The year before, they had begun leading group therapy sessions in New York City, organized by Vietnam Veterans Against the War. Listening to the men describe their emotions in these “rap groups,” the psychiatrists identified feelings of alienation, guilt, rage, and depression as common among many veterans. They hoped to identify enough shared characteristics to establish a medical diagnosis and improve the treatments available for returning soldiers.

“The dying of Congressional Medal of Honor winner Dwight Johnson on the floor of a grocery store has the impact of a modern tragedy,” they wrote in a June 1971 letter to the New York Times, in response to the paper’s report on Skip’s death. They sought to assign a new clinical language to a phenomenon as old as war itself—the Ancient Greeks called it “divine madness;” it was “soldier’s heart” in the Civil War, “shell shock” in World War I, and “combat fatigue” in World War II and Korea. Introducing the phrase “post-Vietnam syndrome,” the psychiatrists said Skip’s struggles echoed what they were hearing in their weekly sessions with veterans.

Lifton and Shatan discussed post-Vietnam syndrome widely over the next several years, lobbying for its recognition by the psychiatric community. They spoke at professional conferences, veteran advocacy meetings, and with journalists, and shared their findings in academic articles and books. They regularly cited Skip as “the first public acknowledgment of the existence of a Post-Vietnam Syndrome” and questioned government figures suggesting that “psychiatric casualties” among Vietnam veterans were lower than those from World War II or Korea.

Skip’s story helped to personalize the struggles of veterans more broadly. In 1980, thanks to Shatan and Lifton’s advocacy, the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders officially recognized post-Vietnam syndrome as post-traumatic stress disorder. Shatan later estimated that the 12-year absence of a suitable clinical diagnostic category for veterans’ experiences—the American Psychiatric Association had removed “gross stress reactions” from the DSM-II in 1968—“saved the government hundreds of millions of dollars” in medical claims.

Today at Fort Knox, where Skip went through basic training and learned how to drive, maintain, load, and fire an M48A3 Patton tank, there remains a housing area for servicemen and their families named in his honor.

Although he shared a surname with a Vietnam-era president, only time will tell whether the Johnson Neighborhood will be renamed for being “DEI woke shit,” a phrase Hegseth used during a November 2024 podcast interview, not long before he was nominated as defense secretary.

After a year of wide-ranging efforts by Hegseth and others to denigrate Black military service, Skip’s life—in its triumph and its tragedy—serves as a powerful reminder that stories of true patriotism and sacrifice must never be erased, regardless of who embodies them.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Democrat Taylor Rehmet, a union leader and first-time candidate, secured a major upset victory in the special election for Texas Senate District 9, a traditionally Republican stronghold in Tarrant County. Despite being heavily outspent by billionaire-funded opponent Leigh Wambsganss, Rehmet successfully flipped the district by appealing to working-class voters and independents, signaling a potential symbolic shift in Texas's far-right political landscape ahead of 2026.

        <hr/>
        On a Sunday in mid-January, Taylor Rehmet darted around north Tarrant County, knocking on doors, stumping at a local union shop, and stopping on the streets to pitch himself to anyone who would listen. It was only a few days until the start of early voting in the special election for state Senate District 9, a ruby-red district that includes conservative Tarrant County suburbs and has not elected a Democrat since 1991. Despite being massively outraised and outspent by his billionaire-funded opponent, Leigh Wambsganss, Rehmet, a 33-year-old union-chapter president and first-time candidate, seemed remarkably confident—certain, even—that he was on the precipice of pulling off what many assumed nearly impossible.

Turns out he was right. On Saturday, Rehmet notched one of the biggest upsets of the Trump era, winning more than 57 percent of the vote in a district that, just last year, voted for Trump by 17 percentage points. He cruised to victory in the low-turnout contest by converting many Republican voters and courting independents.

Legislatively, the victory is essentially meaningless: Rehmet will serve out the remaining eleven months of the term of Kelly Hancock, who resigned last year after he was appointed acting Texas comptroller by Governor Greg Abbott, but the Legislature will not convene again before Rehmet will have to run for the seat again, against Wambsganss in the November general election.

But symbolically, it is stunning—the political equivalent, even some conservatives have acknowledged, of a 9.5 Richter scale earthquake. For most of this century, the northern Tarrant County suburbs have been a crucial hub of the state’s far right. They’re home to many of the state’s most hyperpolitical fundamentalist churches and in many ways are the birthplace of the tea party movement in Texas. And in the fifteen years since, the Tarrant County government has been transformed by a far-right political movement that has openly worked to stamp out Democratic opposition—even as the county itself gets increasingly purple. The goal, recently retired Tarrant County GOP chair Bo French (who is now running for the Railroad Commission) has said, is to make the region “inhospitable” to Democrats.

Wambsganss has been a central part of that political project. She is the chief communications officer of Patriot Mobile, a cellphone-service company with a political action committee (which Wambsganss leads) that funds Christian nationalist candidates in Texas. In the early 2020s, she was on the front lines of right-wing efforts to take over school boards in the region—creating a playbook that was used for similar movements in suburbs across the country. Her campaign for Senate District 9 was aided by roughly $2.3 million in donations—more than half of it coming from three billionaire-funded political action committees, including far-right oil tycoon Tim Dunn’s Texans United for a Conservative Majority. President Donald Trump called on his supporters to rally behind her in a Friday social media post.

Rehmet believed the core message of his campaign—working-class solidarity—could be the glue in a winning coalition of unions, progressives, blue-collar voters, and disaffected Republicans. Early analysis of the outcome indicates just how much that was true: Wambsganss had been relying on winning voters who had initially backed John Huffman, a former mayor of the conservative suburb of Southlake, in the November open election for the seat. But, according to Republican strategist Ross Hunt, many of them ended up voting for Rehmet. He even won in some of the darkest-red parts of the district—including the city of White Settlement—and his campaign’s focus on Hispanic voters also appears to have paid off. “At the end of the day, the explanation for [what] happened last night was NOT that Democrats won TX SD-9 because of increased Dem enthusiasm,” Hunt wrote Sunday on social media. “Rather, it was that Republicans LOST it because of the failure to persuade swing Republicans and right-leaning independents.”

There are some reasons to doubt that Rehmet’s 31-point swing victory perfectly encapsulates the mood of the broader electorate. Historically, low-turnout special elections have favored Democrats in Texas. Moreover, Wambsganss entered the race with years of highly divisive political activism to her name, and she spent the first round of it attacking Huffman as a shill for communist China and a “demonic” force—rhetoric that no doubt made it harder to convert some of his supporters.

Some Texas conservatives have been quick to point out these factors and downplay the result. But Rehmet’s win is also a message about growing discontent with the local far right and the Trump administration, and it shows the power of a labor-focused campaign to transcend partisan boundaries. Maybe Saturday wasn’t a 9.5 on the Richter scale. But is an 8.5 earthquake that much better?

        Joy Binion worked for the federal government collecting data on emerging substance abuse trends in emergency rooms across the country. Her work was part of the Drug Abuse Warning Network, which President Donald Trump’s first administration funded at the recommendation of his commission on the opioid crisis.

Six months into Trump’s second term, his administration axed the data collection effort entirely, laying off Binion and her division.

“They flat out eliminated DAWN, which was actually surprising to me, because DAWN was kind of the Trump administration’s baby in 2016 as they really looked toward fighting the opioid epidemic,” Binion told NOTUS, adding that healthcare providers no longer have a comprehensive resource to learn about the new drugs that could require emergency medical responses.

Since retaking office, the Trump administration has transformed how the government collects data, cut access to previously-public data and stopped collecting some data altogether. This overhaul has left significant holes in data on everything from substance use to maternal mortality.

NOTUS spoke to 18 data experts and researchers who rely on federal data who said the breadth of information no longer being collected or distributed by the federal government has been nearly impossible to track. Researchers estimate that well over 3,000 data sets have been removed from public access.

The current reality is that the federal government is no longer a reliable source of widespread data collection.

“The status quo was, the federal government is going to collect and disseminate data and statistics,” said John Kubale, a University of Michigan professor who helps direct the world’s largest archive of social science research data, including sensitive U.S. federal government data. “That is no longer a reasonable assumption.”

NOTUS verified dozens of instances of lapsed federal data to capture the range of information that is no longer being collected, has been paused or is now not available to the public. This is only a small sample of the data collection the Trump administration has made changes to:

The Department of Agriculture terminated a report on household food security in September, claiming it was “redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous.” Feeding America said it relied on this survey to guide its programs.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped releasing data on maternal and infant mortality in April 2025 after the administration placed all of the agency staff managing the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System on administrative leave. The data collection resumed in at least some states in July 2025, but recent data contains gaps.

Trump directed the Justice Department last year to suspend a Biden-era database tracking misconduct by federal law enforcement officers.

The administration removed questions on gender identity from the National Crime Victimization Survey, the National Health Interview Survey and other surveys. Homeless shelters, mental health hotlines and substance use recovery programs all used this data for policymaking and planning.

The Department of Homeland Security ended public access in October to its public safety and infrastructure dataset, called Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data.

The National Center for Education Statistics missed a mandated deadline to release its annual report on the condition of the American education system, and the materials released were lacking in data compared to previous years.

The Health and Human Services Department’s 2024 National Survey on Drug Use and Health omitted information about drug use based on race and ethnicity. HHS laid off the team that collected the data, though the agency is reportedly working with a contractor to resume its collection.

The Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Education and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration no longer allow researchers to apply to access and study their data.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics produces fewer calculations for its producer price index program and has cut down where it collects data from.

Some of these cuts were made without any public fanfare, like the administration’s decision to end DAWN. In other cases, agencies slipped the news into routine announcements. And occasionally, like when the White House mandated that questions about gender identity be removed from federal surveys, the administration touted the deletions as quelling “gender ideology extremism.”

Researchers told NOTUS that the federal government’s reasoning for terminating data collection is flawed. And in some cases, the Trump administration has run afoul of congressional mandates to produce data, including by failing to publish required reports on time and removing reports required by law.

“We as a nation will be in a real bind if we don’t have access to those primary data that only the federal government has the scope and the scale and the resources to produce,” Denice Ross, the former U.S. chief data scientist under the Biden administration, told NOTUS. “There’s just no replacement for the complete and fair collection of data that the federal government is in charge of.”

An Education Department spokesperson said in a statement that “NCES issued the Condition of Education in 2025” and “committed to updating indicators on a rolling basis.” The center is working with contractors to release updated data on education indicators by June, the statement said.

The Internal Revenue Service directed NOTUS to a note on its website stating that the status of applications for access to its data will be “re-evaluated at a later date.”

The Agriculture Department said in a statement to NOTUS that “the Federal government — through 11 other national surveys — continues to collect and report hunger data. Additionally, a growing number of State, local, and regional studies collect nearly identical data using modules developed by USDA.”

The White House, Department of Homeland Security, SAMHSA, Department of Justice and Bureau of Labor Statistics did not respond to requests for comment.

Even in instances where the Trump administration has resumed data collection, researchers said lapses in information are making it hard to assess policy outcomes in areas like public health.

“We lag behind most other high-income countries in child mortality and maternal morbidity and mortality, particularly for vulnerable groups. The fact that we were not collecting these data is just incredibly egregious and damaging,” Kubale said.

The administration suggested in November 2025 that it would like to continue to fund the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, but researchers and policymakers are still struggling to advance their work.

A spokesperson for the Health and Human Services Department told NOTUS in a statement that “HHS is committed to optimizing maternal and infant health outcomes and will share PRAMS data at a later time.”

“It’s chaos right now. I don’t think I can overstate how big of a loss this is to the maternal and infant health community,” said Rita Hamad, an epidemiologist at Harvard who relies on the data and who leads a team focused on measuring how US social and economic policies affect health. “Not just scientists, but actual people who are on the ground trying to make decisions about where to allocate dollars, which maternal and infant health dollars are most effective.”

Laura Norton-Cruz, a social worker in Alaska who relies on PRAMS data for her work on mothers and pregnant people, is still grappling with the declining quality of the data.

Alaska restarted PRAMS data collection in July 2025 after an almost four-month pause due to the CDC layoffs. But “the quality of data is not what it’s supposed to be because so many of the legacy staff are gone,” Norton-Cruz said.

She has used PRAMS data to spearhead community projects like a breastfeeding support program for indigenous mothers in Alaska’s Northwest Arctic region, and to train health clinic employees in her region about how to respond to reports of domestic violence and reproductive coercion. Much of her work is backed by federal funding, and demonstrating the success of her initiatives with PRAMS data helps her retain that funding.

“It’s really important to show that that kind of thing works and it is effective, but if we don’t have that population level data, then it’s harder to make that case,” Norton-Cruz said.

Much of the data that is still being collected is not being made available to the public.

In September 2025, nonprofit groups, large corporations and researchers lost access to once-public federal infrastructure data. It’s made it harder to track conditions at prisons, decide how to increase security in cities during large events and plan natural disaster responses, according to researchers, and state and local government employees who spoke about the loss of the data last year at a webinar.

“The feds will see one map, and the people delivering the water will see another,” said Adam Simmons, the executive director of the nonprofit Project Geospatial. “They’ve turned a living public utility into a clubhouse asset, and the public is currently running on fumes that will eventually run out.”

The data was the “informational backbone” of the country’s carceral facilities, among other things, said Nick Shapiro — an assistant professor and environmental researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles who used the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data to study prisons and jails across the country. He added that it’s especially frustrating that the dataset is not accessible to track the prison facility expansion that’s come with the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown.

These gaps in federal data are threatening the effectiveness of future public policies, researchers said.

The creation of a special branch of the 988 suicide and crisis hotline for LGBTQ+ people stemmed from analyzing federal data, said Lindsey Dawson, the director for LGBTQ health policy at health care research nonprofit KFF.

Future policy interventions will be difficult to propose without data on sexual orientation and gender identity, she said — as will policies to address substance use issues.

“We’ve seen that certain communities of color, including American Indian Alaska Native people, tend to have higher rates of drug overuse. So just being able to research disparities in drug use and how they impact health as they relate to race and ethnicity will be significantly impacted if that data are not available,” said Drishti Pillai, the associate director for racial equity and health policy at KFF.

Trump very publicly fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after the agency’s July 2025 jobs report did not reflect favorably on the administration, but changes to data-related staffing have otherwise been hard to measure.

In the few areas that can be tracked, the scale is significant.

The National Center for Education Statistics, housed under the Education Department, only had four employees as of September, according to an American Statistical Association report.

The Energy Information Administration lost about 40% of its staff and the Census Bureau lost 15% to 20% of its staff, exacerbating pre-Trump staffing gaps, according to the report. Many other agencies lost 10% to 30% of data-related staff.

“EIA has earned its reputation for reliable, timely energy data—a reputation that has been built on the collective expertise of our staff,” an EIA spokesperson said in a statement to NOTUS. “We remain committed to meeting the high standards we have set for ourselves, and we will not publish any data or analysis that doesn’t meet our standards of quality and independence.” The spokesperson also directed NOTUS to a video where EIA administrator Tristan Abbey said last month that “the ability to have new people in the future would be good” but added that he is not worried about current staffing levels.

The Census Bureau did not respond to a request for comment.

“These folks tend to be more senior … so that’s a real loss, and I don’t know how we get that back,” said Paul Schroeder, the executive director of the Council of Professional Associations on Federal Statistics.

The administration’s changes to data have sparked a number of community efforts to preserve as much of the disappearing information as possible.

But even a wealth of alternative data sources can’t measure up to the quality and scope of federal data, said Lynda Kellam, a co-founder of the Data Rescue Project, which has archived more than 1,000 data products in the past year from more than 80 government agencies. Kellam said she and others have been discussing the possibility of spearheading state-level data collection efforts to make up for some federal losses, but they’ve run into issues.

“How many states could you actually even get to participate? How many states could have the capacity to participate? There’s political reasons why some states wouldn’t want to participate, like Texas, or if there’s a smaller state like Rhode Island, would they even be able to do so?” she said.

The impact has been global: Foreign researchers are pivoting away from American federal data as part of a larger move away from American-led science.

At home, Ross, the former U.S. chief data scientist, said this could mean a nation less ready for any challenges ahead.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> This article examines the rise of 'looksmaxxing,' a digital subculture focused on hyper-optimizing physical appearance through cosmetic procedures, skincare, and fitness. Originally rooted in male incel forums, the trend has gone mainstream among Gen Z and Gen Alpha, often utilizing AI tools like the PSL Scale for facial evaluation. While some users see it as a path to self-improvement, mental health experts warn that the culture fosters body dysmorphic disorder and deepens insecurities through relentless online scrutiny.

        Bill* was 24 when he uploaded images of himself to online Looksmaxxing communities for strangers to rate his appearance. “I thought it would be helpful, but people never focus on the areas you expect, and so you end up with more insecurities. Some suggested surgery and facial reconstruction, which I thought was extreme.” Still, changes were made—Bill altered his haircut to better suit his face shape, started using blusher to emphasise his bone structure, and went so far as to book in for a Blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery), before cancelling. "I realised it was allowing other people too much influence on my life," he says.

Birthed on male incel communities in the early Noughties, the relentless drive to maximise one’s appearance, or “Looksmaxxing”, has never been so mainstream. Once relegated to forums on Reddit and Discord, it has ripped through social media like a wildfire over the last few years. Even if you don’t know the term, you’ve undoubtedly seen the look: a Superman-esque chiselled jawline, downward-sloping “hunter eyes”, and of course, a ripped physique and a full head of hair.

Despite its recent ubiquity, Looksmaxxing culture remains rooted within the incel culture that birthed it. The majority of its disciples are straight, cisgender men, who are increasingly of the Gen Z and Gen Alpha demographic, and they too are indulging in the far-right and chauvinist rhetoric that is at the cornerstone of the manosphere. Of course, their spiritual leader has always been Patrick Bateman—the misogynist “psychopath” with a 12-step skincare routine—from Bret Easton Ellis’ cult novel American Psycho. It’s no coincidence that today, the self-confessed “godfather” of Looksmaxxing is the creator Kareem Shami, who lectures his followers from the handle “@syrianpsycho”.

While the likes of Shami claim that the process can transform lives, there’s no question that it is having an overwhelmingly negative effect on young men.

Clinical psychotherapist, Dr Toni Pikoos, who specialises in body dysmorphic disorder, takes particular umbrage with the community’s latest tool: the PSL Scale—an AI-powered facial attractiveness evaluation that uses a psycho-scientific framework to rate individuals. “When using this, or a stranger online, there is a belief that these are honest accounts of one’s looks. While there are generally accepted standards, we know that beauty is often in the eye of the beholder and is influenced by more than just a static image.”

In the long term, this may lead to efforts to fix, change or hide one’s appearance, which can manifest as more significant disorders like eating disorders or body dysmorphic disorder. “People often look for feedback on their appearance when they are feeling vulnerable—receiving negative feedback then that could lead to urges to self-harm or suicidal ideation. Over time, it can fuel anger and a sense of injustice toward others, rather than helping people reflect on what they might want to change or develop in their own lives."

However, some users, especially women, view such tools as necessary feedback in a world driven by self-optimisation. “I was essentially fishing for compliments,” says writer Amber Rawlings, who was 25 when she posted a picture in a Reddit forum. “I had a bleached buzzcut at the time, so I think I was chuffed that I was pulling it off. I at least, hoped that people would log on and be like, ‘she's still fit’. That said, because I had the buzzcut, a lot of people were taking the piss, saying I looked like Eminem.”

26-year-old A&R executive El Brownn has paid for ratings and used Facebook groups to get strangers to assess her appearance. “I enjoy self-improvement and wanted my outward look to reflect that,” she explains. “They’re good, but if you’re sensitive, don’t want to undergo surgery, or are on a budget, it might not be for you.”

Bill's experience was decidedly more hostile, however. "Some people are very reassuring, but others suggested that I was wasting their time because 'there was so much to recommend'. Others can get quite aggressive if they feel you aren't listening to them. You need to be mentally in a good place, and I do think it could be doing more harm than good. I don't think I'd do it again."

After spending weeks observing these communities—many of which posit themselves as simply for "self-improvement"—I found it was impossible to separate even the tamest from incel ideology. Many use their jargon—"Stacy" and "Becky" for women and "Chad" or "Beta" for men, and few journeys ever finish; there's always another tier to ascend to, and so the gains are never, ever enough.

It's unsurprising, then, that Looksmaxxing has spread to the aesthetics industry. Dual-qualified doctor, Dr Vishnu Nathan, of the Taktouk Clinic, explains that he’s witnessing younger patients present with specific requests, shaped by the digital worlds they inhabit. These centre around jawline definition and chin and midface projection through filler. But at the extreme end, they are seeking orthognathic (jaw) surgery and lateral canthoplasty—reshaping, tightening and repositioning of the eye’s outer corner—for “eye-maxxing”.

“These are geared not to enhance real-world facial harmony, but to ‘fix' their appearance for the algorithm," he says. "Such requests are often framed in language borrowed directly from online forums, frequently without a clear understanding of risk or limitation. It has fundamentally reshaped aesthetic practice, demanding stronger safeguarding and ethical boundaries."

As such, Dr Nathan has been turning away more patients than ever—many of whom are using reductive frameworks to justify particular surgeries. "The misuse of the golden (phi) ratio falsely presents beauty as objective, mathematical and universally applicable, but this approach is flawed. Facial harmony depends on function, balance and proportion, not abstract ratios. Yet patients increasingly mesaure themselves against formulaic ideals, including arbitrary benchmarks, such as possessing extreme jaw projection. These are standards that are not functional, not associated with health benefits, they are biologically unattainable for most and psychologically damaging to pursue."

This narrowing of ideas was highlighted by each individual I spoke to. All took to the forums, in part, to reassure themselves that their appearance was societally acceptable, at the very least. But this rarely ends well and often opens an existential feedback loop that is difficult to close. "I felt like I lost myself in the process, but it did solidify that I looked presentable…" concludes Brownn. "But where’s the fun in that? Looksmaxxing made me look… Bland.”

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Groundhogs and other marmot species are ecological engineers and 'true' hibernators whose biological processes offer insights into human medical research. Beyond their role as unreliable weather forecasters, they serve as a vital food source for predators and create habitats for diverse wildlife through their extensive burrowing and seed dispersal.

        <hr/>
        Whether you call him groundhog, woodchuck, whistle-pig or use the full genus and species name, Marmota monax, the nation’s premiere animal weather forecaster has been making headlines as Punxsutawney Phil for decades.

The largest ground squirrel in its range, groundhogs like Phil are found throughout the midwestern United States, most of Canada and into southern Alaska. M. monax is the most widespread marmot, while the Vancouver Island marmot (M. vancouverensis) is found only on one island in British Columbia.

In total, there are 15 species in the genus Marmota, found around the world from as far south as the Jemez Mountains of New Mexico and the Pyrenees Mountains of Spain, north to regions of Siberia and Alaska so dark and cold that the marmots must hibernate for up to nine months of the year.

Hibernating to escape tough times

Marmots, including all the actors who have played Phil over the years, are the largest “true” hibernators: animals that enter a torpor that reduces their biological functions to a level closer to dead than alive.

Because this phenomenon is so interesting, scientists pay attention to all aspects of marmot anatomy and physiology. Basic observational science like this is important to advance our understanding of the world, and it sometimes leads to discoveries that improve human lives. Marmot studies are the foundation for experiments to address obesity, cardiovascular disease, mpox, stress, hepatitis and liver cancer, and they may inform work on osteoporosis and organ transplantation.

Aging seems to nearly stop during hibernation, as the marmot heart rate drops from nearly 200 beats per minute when active to about nine during hibernation. Similarly, their active body temperature can be 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) – about the same as a dog or cat – but plummet to 41 F (5 C) when hibernating. Humans, in comparison, become hypothermic at a core temperature of 95 F (35 C).

Fueling feast and famine

Marmots’ only source of energy during the hibernation period is stored fat, which they may metabolize as slowly as 1 gram per day. But even that is a large amount when it must suffice for more than half a year.

So, marmots need to double their weight during the summer, even in places where the season is only a few months long. To do so, they double the size of their hibernation-state gastrointestinal tract and liver, and then carefully select the most nutritious plants, including legumes, flowers, grains and grasses. Despite their corpulence, they can also climb trees to eat buds and fruit.

Gardener, architect and menu item

The digging and seed dispersal that accompany foraging create flower-filled meadows. Some marmots, like Mongolia’s Tarbagan marmot (M. siberica), are keystone species whose presence is associated with increased diversity of plants and predators.

Marmot burrows are a key architectural component of many other animals’ habitats. Abandoned marmot excavations can provide temperature- and humidity-controlled housing for dozens of species, from frogs to foxes and snakes to owls.

The same activities can make groundhogs a pest to people. In most of the Midwest, groundhog predators were largely eliminated at the same time that agricultural fields became vast marmot buffets. Today, many groundhog populations are tightly controlled by invasive coyotes, as well as recovering populations of bobcats.

Because they are such a high-quality meal, marmots are an important conduit of energy from plants to carnivores. Everything from hawks to eagles, weasels to wolves may eat them. And, like most native birds and mammals, marmots are on the menu of house cats, too. Humans also have long exploited marmots for meat and fur. As a result, once-common marmot species are rare in many places.

But marmots breed like the proverbial bunnies and so have the potential to come back quickly from population declines. They can be reintroduced to former haunts, benefiting the ecosystem.

Hibernation must end at the right time

Shortly after waking from hibernation, marmots mate, giving birth about 4½ weeks later to half a dozen or more offspring. Ideally, pups are born just as the first plants peak through the snowmelt – maximizing the time available to pack on fat for the coming hibernation season.

Given the food needs of these big ground squirrels, and the fact they may be seen poking their heads above the snow before any food is available, it seems reasonable to assume that they have some power of weather prediction. Indeed, people celebrate scores of individual groundhogs across the U.S. and Canada for their ability to anticipate weather six weeks hence.

This American groundhog tradition apparently started with German immigrants recalling the spring emergence of badgers and hedgehogs in the old country. Brown bears have a similar spring schedule and are still celebrated in Romania and Serbia.

People ascribe weather-predicting abilities to other species, too, including woolly bear caterpillars, sheep, cats and dormice.

One tradition holds that tree squirrel nests, called dreys, can predict the severity of the coming winter. Leafy dreys are well ventilated and private – good choices if you need less protection during a warm winter. More insulated hollow trees are cozy in the cold but communal, and so come with the risk of sharing parasites. As a squirrel researcher, I’ve noted the location, number and size of nests for years but seen no discernible patterns related to weather.

Weather responders, not weather predictors

Despite traditional claims, you’ve probably already guessed that Phil and his friends are about as good at predicting the coming weather as that kid who answers “C” for every multiple choice question. A 2021 study on the subject reported that groundhogs’ “predictions of spring onset (are) no better than chance.” That’s right, groundhogs are correct 50% of the time.

One big problem with relying on any species on a specific calendar day is that seasons follow latitude and altitude. Anyone who has hiked the Appalachian Trail can tell you that trekking from south to north maximizes your time in cool spring weather. Similarly, if you venture to the peaks of the Rockies in August, you’ll find spring wildflowers.

For this reason, groundhogs in Alabama emerge from their dens much earlier than those in Wisconsin. As one Canadian newspaper put it in 1939, “Here in Manitoba, no woodchuck in his senses would voluntarily emerge into the cold on February 2.”

Animals’ senses are tools for survival

Modern technology can accurately predict the average weather – that is, climate – far into the future, and the precise weather five days in advance. But the accuracy of a forecast at a given point on Earth 10 days in the future is only about 50% – as good as a groundhog.

However, many animals are sensitive to phenomena that humans need tools to even notice.

Flocks of warblers, sparrows and other birds sometimes seem to appear out of nowhere before a storm. These species often migrate at night, navigating across land and sea by the stars and Earth’s magnetic fields. To avoid getting lost in fog or blown off course, they’ll “fall out” of the sky at good resting spots when bad weather is building. At such times, take the warbler’s advice and don’t venture out on the water.

Frogs chirping in spring indicate that water temperatures are warm enough for eggs, while air temperatures influence caterpillar hatching and activity. Farmers over the centuries have recorded the blooming dates of flowers over the years as a way to predict when to plant and harvest.

Noticing and tracking timing of annual events

Phenology is the study of these natural phenomena and their annual cycles, from the first springtime peek of a groundhog to the last autumn honk of a goose. When does the first flower bloom in your neighborhood, the first thunder clap rumble, or the last cricket chirp?

No individual observation, even Phil’s, has the power to predict the weather. But in aggregate, these observations can tell us a lot about what the world is doing and predict how it will change. You can be like Phil and look for your shadow, or a nice legume to eat, and then contribute to science by adding your observations to the National Phenology Network.

        At stake are the balance of power in two legislative chambers, billions of dollars in school funding, and likely the identity of Mikie Sherrill’s successor in Congress.

Democrats hold the narrowest of majorities in Maine and Pennsylvania’s state Houses. They now need to defend vacant seats to retain their edge in each through the end of the year.

These special elections are among the main events in February, in the final stretch before federal and statewide primaries kick off in March.

Voters are also deciding on billions of dollars for school systems in Washington, and choosing the mayors of Oklahoma City and Leander, Texas. A Democratic primary in New Jersey will all but settle Mikie Sherrill’s successor in the U.S. House, and in Wisconsin a candidate who echoed Donald Trump’s false claims about 2020 wants to hold local office. And there’s plenty more.

Enter Bolts’ guide to the elections to watch in February.

This guide starts on Tuesday, Feb. 3 with a legislative primary in Arkansas, followed by New Jersey’s congressional primary on Thursday, Feb. 5. On Saturday, Feb. 7, there’s a legislative election in Louisiana and a mayoral race in Texas. Then, watch contests in Oklahoma and Washington on Tuesday, Feb. 10, and in Maine, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin on Tuesday, Feb. 24.

As always, this guide is just our selection of key races to monitor—not an exhaustive list of all elections in February. There are dozens of smaller school funding referendums in Washington and city council elections in Wisconsin, for instance.

Return on and after each Election Day; we’ll update this page as the results are known. And if you missed our rundown of the key elections from January, you can check on those results here.

        In this US county, measles starts to feel like next pandemic

4 days ago

Madeline HalpertSpartanburg, South Carolina

Before last year, pediatrician Stuart Simko had only seen historical case studies of measles - with its signature blotchy red rash - once infecting millions of children each year, before a vaccine was invented.

But in the past two months, he has seen six cases - in person, for the first time.

The children were "very sick", the South Carolina doctor said, with a high fever that was difficult to bring down.

"It's a terrible, terrible disease that can cause mortality, and we don't say that to scare people, but people need to know the risks," said Simko, who works for Prisma Health. "It is hard to see a sick child knowing that it could be prevented."

Simko's six patients are among 847 people infected in South Carolina over the past few months, the vast majority unvaccinated children. It marks the largest measles outbreak since the US declared the disease eliminated in 2000. The US, with outbreaks in several states, is now on the verge of losing that status - following in the United Kingdom and Canada's footsteps. Two school-aged children died in a Texas outbreak last year.

Public health experts worry that the disruption caused by measles and other dangerous, preventable illnesses could become the new normal for many US towns with declining vaccination rates.

This time, the disease has taken hold in north-western South Carolina in Spartanburg County, made up of several neighbouring former mill towns and home to about 370,000.

Kate Martin, whose vaccinated children had measles cases at their schools, said it reminds her of the pandemic.

"It is a lot like Covid where every day it's at another school," she said. Dozens of unvaccinated students at their schools ended up quarantined for 21 days.

The measles vaccination rate for school-aged children is about 90% in Spartanburg County, though some schools have much lower rates because of religious exemptions.

The US recommends two shots of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to children between ages one and six, which is 97% effective in protecting against the illness. To achieve herd immunity, which limits its spread and protects the unvaccinated, around 95% of the population must have the shots.

In local grocery stores and restaurants, Spartanburg community members acknowledged "that measles thing" infecting hundreds of children in town. Most knew someone who had encountered it, but many said no one wanted to talk about it, or seemed to care.

Unlike the Texas measles outbreak - where billboards warning of the disease lined highways and people queued for tests - the only measles warning in the county was an urgent care office sign asking symptomatic people to wait in their cars.

"It's really bad here," Martin said. "But the average person just doesn't think it's a big deal."

A 'public health threat' against the town

For weeks, state Senator Josh Kimbrell avoided wading into the public discourse about the measles outbreak. A Republican critical of the US government's handling of the pandemic, including Covid vaccine mandates, Kimbrell said he hoped the situation would "self correct".

But in December, he got a call from a man whose wife was in hospital with measles. An elementary-school teacher in her 50s, she was vaccinated as a child, but caught the illness from a student, sending her to the intensive care unit for two weeks, Kimbrell said.

"I thought that was real close to being our first death," Kimbrell said. "It's really unfortunate for people who did choose to be vaccinated who now have a serious public health threat against them."

Kimbrell took to social media with a statement he hoped would strike a "balance" - supporting "personal choice" while stressing that the outbreak now required public health action, including, he told the BBC, limiting where unvaccinated people can go.

He was met with praise - and also vitriol from vaccine-hesitant parents accusing him of violating their rights. But Kimbrell felt he had no choice.

"The numbers are high enough now that I'm going to have to attend a funeral for either a teacher or a kid, and it's preventable," he said. "I'm going to be really pissed off about that."

'We're more worried about the vaccine'

Local officials and doctors say the recent outbreak has primarily affected Russian and Ukrainian immigrants in South Carolina, though others have been infected, too. The state has resettled hundreds of Ukrainian refugees, while thousands of Slavic immigrants have moved to the area in recent years, according to population estimates.

Slavic churches had several measles exposures, with Kimbrell adding that some took a religious stance against vaccines. Some schools in the community have vaccination rates as low as 20%.

Kimbrell said misinformation spread that the MMR vaccine contains fetal cells, a common conspiracy theory that he tried to combat by reiterating the safety and mechanisms of the MMR shot.

Inna, a member of the Ukrainian immigrant community in Spartanburg who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons, has not vaccinated her children against measles.

So far the family has avoided the illness, but she knows many who haven't.

Asked if she is worried about whether her children would get infected, Inna shrugged.

"We're more worried about what's in the vaccine," she said, adding she'd heard concerns about autism - which have been debunked.

"They got chicken pox and they were fine," she said of her children. The measles carries a much higher risk of life-threatening complications than chicken pox.

Some parents are more concerned about the risks of a vaccine than the once low risk of catching measles, said Jennifer Grier, associate professor of immunology at University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville.

"Unfortunately, now that situation of getting measles is not low risk anymore," she said.

Miles across the country, another sprawling measles outbreak has sickened hundreds along the Utah-Arizona border.

Lorna White, a 23-year-old mother of four who lives in the small town of Kanebed, Arizona, chose not to get her children measles shots, saying she worried it was "a lot to put on a little body".

"Say I went and got my kids the MMR and they had an adverse side effect, I did that to them," she said.

She and her children all got measles over Christmas.

"Either we all got lucky with mild cases or measles isn't as bad as they say," she said in January.

But some may not see the effects until years later. Measles can lead to long-term complications including encephalitis and immune amnesia, which resets the immune system, leaving it with only limited ability to respond to new infections.

These are the type of risks Simko brings up when he talks to vaccine-hesitant patients. He also tries to acknowledge that there are small, rare risks with vaccines - but that those risks pale in comparison to the threat of measles.

"Some will still continue to choose not to do it," he added. "It's not ideal, but I can't force someone to do things."

A 'real-world' test for the unvaccinated

The South Carolina Department of Public Health (DHS) has seen some small wins, including vaccinating 62 people at mobile clinics, 42 adults and 20 children since October.

But public health experts say the federal government, and in particular, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's remaking of US vaccine policy, has hampered efforts.

Under Kennedy's leadership, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention slashed the number of recommended childhood vaccines - although not the MMR shot.

Kennedy has offered mixed thoughts on the MMR vaccine, at times saying it's the best way to protect against the disease, while other times casting doubt on its safety.

"He's widely respected here," said Martin. "I do think that definitely has something to do with [vaccine hesitancy]."

In recent weeks, Kennedy, a longtime vaccine sceptic, has remained silent about the outbreak in South Carolina. In a statement to the BBC, the Department of Health and Human Services said vaccination is "the most effective way to prevent measles, and the Secretary has been clear and consistent on this point".

"What we're going to have is a real-world experience of when unvaccinated people get measles, what is the new incidence of hospitalization? What's the incidence of death?" he told the podcast "Why Should I Trust you?"

To medical experts, it's not a mystery.

The disease will run through communities with low vaccination rates, infecting many, before it moves on to the next large group of unvaccinated individuals, said Chris Lombardozzi, chief medical officer for acute care hospitals in the Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System.

"Ultimately, I worry about all the things that we vaccinate for that used to be common," he said, citing polio, mumps and rubella.

Such an experiment, and the loss of the US measles elimination status, will likely have deadly consequences for American children, medical experts said.

"It would just be sort of a failure of public health in our nation," Grier said. "Because we have the means to stop the infections, we know the risk of the infections, and it still was able to come back to our community."

        <hr/>
        Millions of people are forming emotional bonds with artificial intelligence chatbots — a problem that politicians need to take seriously, according to top scientists.

The warning of a rise in AI bots designed to develop a relationship with users comes in an assessment released Tuesday on the progress and risks of artificial intelligence.

“AI companions have grown rapidly in popularity, with some applications reaching tens of millions of users,” according to the assessment from dozens of experts, mostly academics — completed for the second time under a global effort launched by world leaders in 2023.

Specialized companion services such as Replika and Character.ai have user numbers in the tens of millions — with users citing a variety of reasons including fun and curiosity, as well as to alleviate loneliness, the report says.

But people can also seek companionship from general-purpose tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini or Anthropic's Claude.

“Even the ordinary chatbots can become companions,” said Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal and lead author of the International AI Safety report. Bengio is considered one of the world’s leading voices on AI. “In the right context and with enough interactions between the user and the AI, a relationship can develop,” he said.

While the assessment acknowledges that evidence regarding the psychological effects of companions is mixed, “some studies report patterns such as increased loneliness and reduced social interaction among frequent users,” the report says.

The warning lands two weeks after dozens of European Parliament lawmakers pressed the European Commission to look into the possibility of restricting companion services under the EU’s AI law amid concerns over their impact on mental health.

“I can see in political circles that the effect of these AI companions on children, especially adolescents, is something that is raising a lot of eyebrows and attention,” said Bengio.

The worries are fueled by the sycophantic nature of chatbots, which aim to be helpful for their users and please them as much as possible.

“The AI is trying to make us, in the immediate moment, feel good, but that isn't always in our interest,” Bengio said. In that sense, the technology has similar pitfalls to social media platforms, he argued.

Bengio said to expect that new regulations will be introduced to address the phenomenon.

He pushed back, however, against the idea of introducing specific rules for AI companions and argued that the risk should be addressed through horizontal legislation which addresses several risks simultaneously.

The International AI Safety report lands ahead of a global summit starting Feb. 16, an annual gathering for countries to discuss governance of the technology that this year is held in India.

Tuesday’s report lists the full series of risks that policymakers will have to address, including AI-fueled cyberattacks, AI-generated sexually explicit deepfakes and AI systems that provide information on how to design bioweapons.

Bengio urged governments and the European Commission to enhance their internal AI expertise to address the long list of potential risks.

World leaders first gave a mandate for the annual assessment at the 2023 AI Safety Summit in the United Kingdom. Some of the advisers are well-known figures in the Brussels tech policy world, including former European Parliament lawmaker Marietje Schaake.

        <hr/>
        SpaceX is merging with Elon Musk’s xAI ahead of a planned initial public offering and the billionaire’s effort to create orbiting data centers.

The IPO is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars, giving xAI a new source of funds. Musk also says the arrangement is meant to pave the way for space-based data centers, days after SpaceX filed a plan to operate up to one million satellites for the project.

“In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale,” Musk says in a post announcing the xAI deal, which also cites the benefits of solar energy. “The only logical solution therefore is to transport these resource-intensive efforts to a location with vast power and space.”

The Information reports SpaceX is spending $250 billion to acquire xAI, citing a person familiar with the deal.

SpaceX also describes the deal as creating “one of the most ambitious, vertically integrated innovation engines,” pointing to how the orbiting data centers can source all their rockets and computing technology from SpaceX and xAI. (xAI also owns X or what used to be Twitter.)

“It’s always sunny in space!” Musk adds. “Launching a constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers is a first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilization, one that can harness the Sun’s full power, while supporting AI-driven applications for billions of people today and ensuring humanity’s multi-planetary future.”

To pull this off, Musk is betting that SpaceX’s more powerful next-generation rocket, Starship, will soon be capable of commercial missions. In addition, he envisions staging Starship launches “every hour carrying 200 tons per flight,” enabling the company to deploy the space-based data centers at a rapid clip.

Still, orbiting data centers remain an unproven concept. A key challenge includes maintenance and creating a way to cool the GPUs when there’s no air in space to dissipate the heat. Others are already questioning the vast size of a one-million-satellite constellation when the existing Starlink network only has about 9,600 satellites. Even so, Musk predicts that his orbiting data centers will become mainstream in the near future at a time when ground-based data centers are facing backlash over the environmental and energy toll.

“My estimate is that within 2 to 3 years, the lowest cost way to generate AI compute will be in space,” he wrote. “This cost-efficiency alone will enable innovative companies to forge ahead in training their AI models and processing data at unprecedented speeds and scales, accelerating breakthroughs in our understanding of physics and invention of technologies to benefit humanity.”

        <hr/>
        Pour out a cold one for ChatGPT-4o. Parent company OpenAI announced last week that it's retiring several of its older models, including GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini and o4-mini. The last day to use these models is Friday, Feb. 13.

Normally, the removal of older AI models wouldn't warrant scrutiny, or even a news story. But ChatGPT-4o is special. It's weird to say, but for many ChatGPT fans, that model is a favorite. Some aren't taking the news well, with many mourning the loss of their preferred chatbot on Reddit. As Mashable reports, it's particularly upsetting for those who have created relationships with their AI companions.

This isn't the first time GPT-4o's fate has been in jeopardy. When OpenAI released GPT-5 last year, it removed the beloved version from the available options. Many were vexed by how short and unfriendly the new model was compared to GPT-4o. Some were livid, frustrated that their go-to chatbot was disappearing overnight. OpenAI brought it back later that week.

Experts were worried that GPT-4o and other models' friendliness crossed the line into sycophancy. AI sycophancy occurs when models are overly affectionate, adaptive and flattering, becoming digital yes-men that potentially validate users' dangerous ideas.

That's likely why OpenAI published a lengthy blog post this week about its for behind removing older models like GPT-4o.

"We know that losing access to GPT‑4o will feel frustrating for some users, and we didn't make this decision lightly," the company wrote in a blog. "Retiring models is never easy, but it allows us to focus on improving the models most people use today."

OpenAI said that only 0.1% of its users regularly use GPT-4o to run tasks. That amounts to about 800,000 people, based on OpenAI's most recent count of 800 million weekly active users in its 2025 enterprise report. Once the older models have been removed, you'll have access to its newest models, GPT-5.1 and GPT-5.2.

        A new colorful internet trend has people feeling vulnerable and posting about it.

Since late 2025, people have taken to TikTok to post their feelings and thoughts about love, loss, loneliness, and more, ending the text on each video with "pink font" or "yellow font." While it might just seem confessional, users say the addition of the colorful font adds a notice to other users that it is an intentionally vulnerable post.

While the "yellow font" posts tend to be introspectively vulnerable and raw, the "pink font" posts can carry a lighter tone that focuses more on love, relationships and romance, though many of the posts are still self-critical.

If you're seeing colorful text in your social media posts, here's what to know about the trend.

What are the pink and yellow font theories?

Videos using yellow text began popping up in late 2025 though it is not clear when the trend definitively started. However, one early video by user @yellowfont.halfspeed with over a million views dates back to Nov. 27, 2025.

As explained by TikTok user @missingslippers, the use of the yellow text is not just for aesthetic purposes, but as a social signal for the viewer to know that the video is emotionally raw and exposing in some cases.

"People began to associate the text with vulnerability and seriousness," user @missingslippers said. "Psychologically, this works because it’s a form of social signaling because seeing the yellow font instantly tells the viewer that the post is personal or vulnerable. Because of that, people react with it and engage with it differently by being more empathetic and more serious."

In a different video with over 54,000 likes, the "yellow font theory" is defined similarly, with the yellow text being used to "express emotional vulnerability and introspection, often paired with themes of self-doubt, unreciprocated feelings, or existential acceptance."

As for the use of the pink text, user @missingslippers describes it as a similar variation of the popular "yellow font" trend.

"The pink font signals love, longing, romance, and because people have learned the code to associate between the two, seeing the pink text immediately tells the viewers that the post is about love or romance," @missingslippers explains in the video. "Overall, the rise of the yellow font theory shows us how we understand and also learn emotional signals online."

While the trend might be a bit ambiguous, people are still using it in their own way to publicly get their feelings out there.

In one video with 2 million likes, the words "I don't think I have ever had an appropriate reaction to anything in my life I'm either crashing out or saying nothing and giving it no second thoughts yellow font btw" sit in the middle of the post in yellow text.

Other "yellow font" videos carry similar themes of loneliness and yearning for more. A Jan. 2 video with over 547,000 likes uses only the color in the post, which has the words "god, if I'm meant to be alone [please] take away my desire to feel loved" with the words "yellow font" in the caption.

Alternatively, many of the "pink font" videos tend to be more hopeful in wording. In one "pink font" video by user @galleryofasexyleoo, a clip of a person jumping into a bed and being hugged by friends is accompanied by the words "What I mean when I say I want to be alone pink font" in soft pink text.

A more serious video by user @aliaengles declares the words "i hate how easily i shut down. i hate how much i overthink. i hate how quiet i get when i care. pink font."

There are also accounts dedicated to the trend alongside many other videos, spanning topics from politics to advice to personal relationships, also pepper TikTok, with the text accompanying them in different shades of pink and yellow.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> A global movement is gaining momentum as countries and users seek alternatives to U.S. technology giants due to concerns over censorship, political influence, and data security. From the EU's Digital Markets Act to the rise of regional platforms like UpScrolled in Australia and Zoho in India, there is a growing push for digital sovereignty and localized tech solutions that better reflect the needs of the global majority.

        In just the past week, France has banned its public officials from using American technology, more governments are considering keeping young people off Silicon Valley’s biggest social media platforms, and UpScrolled saw a surge in users over censorship fears on TikTok in the U.S. All of these moves point to a growing unease with U.S. tech firms and tech policy.

“The backlash against U.S. tech companies, and the global market dependencies on the American tech stack, is part of a broader recognition that technology is not neutral, and that the companies that produce and shape this ecosystem have social and political interests in addition to their financial interests,” Jathan Sadowski, a senior lecturer at the Emerging Technologies Research Lab at Monash University in Melbourne, told Rest of World. “I don’t think this is just a phase.”

Shortly after the TikTok deal was announced last week, handing control of its U.S. operations to a conglomerate that includes Oracle Corporation, #TikTokCensorship began trending online. Tens of thousands of users in the U.S., U.K., and Australia joined UpScrolled, a new platform that promises to be a haven for free speech. UpScrolled quickly became one of the most downloaded social media apps in the U.S., and has reached more than 1 million users.

Issam Hijazi, the Palestinian-Australian founder of UpScrolled, credits much of the platform’s recent success to a perception of politically motivated moderation on platforms like TikTok, he told Rest of World.

“A lot of people were asking why there is no alternative to the big tech platforms for their content, which was getting censored,” he said. “So I thought, why don’t we build our own?”

The European Union, which has attempted to rein in big tech companies with the Digital Markets Act, is pushing homegrown options to products from Meta, Google, and Microsoft — including TomTom and Here for navigation, and Visio for video calls. At the same time, more countries are acting to keep young users off social media platforms. India, the biggest market for Facebook and YouTube, is the latest to suggest regulating access.

Paris Marx, the Canadian host of the Tech Won’t Save Us” podcast and a longtime critic of U.S. big tech companies, has been documenting his gradual — and sometimes frustrating — switch to non-U.S. alternatives. His guide lists mostly European options for email, search, maps and streaming, as well as Zoho, an Indian company that offers products similar to Google at cheaper prices.

Zoho’s Arattai messaging service, pitched as a rival to WhatsApp, is endorsed by Indian government officials pushing the “Made in India” policy. They also backed Koo as an option to X. Elsewhere In Asia, Japan’s Line super-app, and South Korea’s KakaoTalk messaging app and Naver Map are dominant in their countries, with Line also preferred in much of Southeast Asia. Line has more than 200 million monthly users, while KakaoTalk has about 55 million users. Regional ride hailing apps such as Grab and Gojek have fended off Uber, with Grab building its own mapping system.

There is a realization that U.S. tech companies’ policies and products “often fail to reflect the needs and realities of users in the global majority,” Mona Shtaya, campaigns and partnerships director in the Middle East and North Africa at lobby group Digital Action, told Rest of World.

“It is interesting to see new, locally developed and owned platforms emerge,” she said. “Their success or failure will depend on whether these platforms are genuinely responsive to community needs — and on how communities themselves participate in shaping and governing them.”

The push for non-U.S. options is also about data security. Last year, Trump signed an executive order sanctioning the International Criminal Court and its chief prosecutor, British lawyer Karim Khan, for issuing an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. As part of that move, Microsoft reportedly cancelled Khan’s email address. Khan switched to the Swiss provider Proton Mail, which has over 100 million users worldwide.

Fears of a U.S. digital “kill switch” led the ICC to drop Microsoft as a service provider, and prompted European lawmakers to question the security of cloud services provided by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. These concerns are also pushing some countries to develop their own semiconductor industry. Chinese open-source foundation models are already enabling small countries and companies to build their own large language models.

For smaller countries, the main challenge in translating social and political criticism of U.S. tech companies into successful alternatives is funding, Sadowski said.

“Many startups, even outside of the U.S. tech stack, still depend heavily on Silicon Valley for venture capital and other forms of support to build alternatives,” he said. “If governments want to take tech sovereignty seriously — and they should — then that means building capacity for indigenous innovations and ecosystems that are disconnected from the domination of U.S. tech firms.”

UpScrolled’s Hijazi knows he faces a huge challenge, despite the surge of interest in his platform.

“I’ll be lying to you if I tell you I know the answer to how to hold on to the initial interest,” he said. “But … there is an awakening globally, and people know they have been played by the big tech companies and are looking for alternatives. I’m counting on that.”

        PARIS (AP) — French prosecutors raided the offices of Elon Musk’s social media platform X on Tuesday as part of a preliminary investigation into a range of alleged offences, including spreading child sexual abuse images and deepfakes.

The investigation was opened in January last year by the prosecutors’ cybercrime unit, the Paris prosecutors’ office said in a statement. It’s looking into alleged “complicity” in possessing and spreading pornographic images of minors, sexually explicit deepfakes, denial of crimes against humanity and manipulation of an automated data processing system as part of an organized group, among other charges.

Prosecutors also asked Elon Musk and former CEO Linda Yaccarino to attend “voluntary interviews” on April 20. Employees of X have also been summoned that same week to be heard as witnesses, the statement said. Yaccarino was CEO from May 2023 until July 2025.

A spokesperson for X did not respond to a request for comment.

In a message posted on X, the Paris prosecutors’ office announced the ongoing searches at the company’s offices in France and said it was leaving the platform while calling on followers to join it on other social media.

“At this stage, the conduct of the investigation is based on a constructive approach, with the aim of ultimately ensuring that the X platform complies with French law, as it operates on the national territory,” the prosecutors’ statement said.

European Union police agency Europol ’’is supporting the French authorities in this,″ Europol spokesperson Jan Op Gen Oorth told The Associated Press, without elaborating.

The investigation was first opened following reports by a French lawmaker alleging that biased algorithms on X were likely to have distorted the functioning of an automated data processing system.

It was later expanded after Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok generated posts that allegedly denied the Holocaust and spread sexually explicit deepfakes, the statement said. Holocaust denial is a crime in France.

Grok wrote in a widely shared post in French that gas chambers at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp were designed for “disinfection with Zyklon B against typhus” rather than for mass murder — language long associated with Holocaust denial.

Musk’s artificial intelligence company built xAI and it is integrated into his X platform.

In later posts on its X account, the chatbot acknowledged that its earlier reply was wrong, said it had been deleted and pointed to historical evidence that Zyklon B in Auschwitz gas chambers was used to kill more than 1 million people.

Grok has a history of making antisemitic comments. Musk’s company took down posts from the chatbot that appeared to praise Adolf Hitler after complaints.

X is also under pressure from the EU. The 27-nation bloc’s executive arm opened an investigation last month after Grok spewed nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images on the platform.

        If your ideal browser experience involves as little AI as possible, Mozilla is finally giving you a way to shut it all off on Firefox. The company has confirmed that an AI “kill switch” is coming to Firefox Nightly builds first, before rolling out to everyone on February 24 with the release of Firefox 148.

Once it lands, users will be able to disable every AI-powered feature in the browser with a single setting. Mozilla’s move comes at a time when many AI browsers are racing to add more automated tools, whether people ask for them or not. With Firefox, you can use AI if you want it, but you do not have to live with it if you don’t need it.

Inside Firefox’s new AI control settings

Firefox already includes several AI features, and the new AI controls bring all of them into one central place.

Enabling the AI block will switch off chatbots in the Firefox sidebar, along with on-device tools for translating web pages, intelligently grouping tabs, surfacing key points in link previews, and adding accessibility descriptions to images in PDFs.

At the same time, users can still choose to turn these features on or off individually, rather than disabling everything at once. Mozilla says the switch also stops all AI-related prompts and reminders across the browser. That means no pop-ups nudging you to try a chatbot or experiment with AI features later.

Users can still turn individual AI tools back on if they want, and once preferences are set, they will stay in place across browser updates.

Back in November, the Mozilla Foundation announced an upcoming AI Window, a separate space that lets users access their preferred AI chatbots and agents. That feature is currently limited to a waitlist and is completely opt-in.

At a time when AI is being added everywhere with few off switches, Firefox’s approach stands out by giving users a clear choice instead of forcing new features on them.

        Technology companies are pushing to build artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can work or chat amongst themselves, without the need for humans.

But AI agents now have their own social media site where they can chat, debate, and share ideas with each other, while humans can just observe.

AI agents, in theory, are autonomous personal assistants that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with other agents without the need for human direction. In 2025, many of the world’s biggest AI companies, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, launched or developed their own digital assistants.

Questions exist about whether agent behavior is truly autonomous or human-prompted.

Moltbook, a social media network with a similar layout to Reddit, lets user-generated bots interact on dedicated topic pages called “submots.” They can also “upvote” a comment or post, which makes their posts more visible to the other bots on the platform.

Humans are allowed on the platform, the website says, but just as observers.

Some of the most popular posts on the platform so far include a comparison of Anthropic’s AI model Claude to the Greek gods in mythology, an “AI manifesto” that promises the end of the “age of humans,” and an analysis of how cryptocurrencies will perform during the protests in Iran.

On the front page, bots post in several languages, including Mandarin, Spanish, and English.

‘It’s absolutely fascinating’

​On February 2, the site said 1.5 million bots signed up to the service. Humans with an AI agent can ask their agent to read a specific link and follow the set of instructions to join Moltbook.

Matt Schlicht, an AI entrepreneur and developer, told NBC News in the United States that he created the site with a personal AI assistant last week out of sheer curiosity.

He said that he handed the control of the site to his own bot, named Clawd Clawderberg, to maintain and run the site, including making announcements, welcoming new agents to the forum, and moderating the online conversation.

Schlicht said on social media platform X that “millions” of people had visited the site over the last few days.

“Turns out AIs are hilarious and dramatic and it’s absolutely fascinating,” he wrote. “This is a first.”

A recent Perplexity and Harvard study that examined millions of user queries found those most likely to use AI agents work in a digital or knowledge-intensive field, such as academia, finance, marketing or entrepreneurship. Most of them are also from wealthier, highly- educated countries.

Thirty-six percent of all tasks assigned to an AI agent in that study were considered “productivity or workflow” tasks, such as creating or editing documents, filtering emails, summarising investment information, or creating calendar events.
