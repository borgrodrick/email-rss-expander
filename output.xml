        <hr/>
        Platformer is an independent media company supported by its readers. As such, I strive to maintain the highest standard of professional ethics. Here is our code of conduct, divided into two sections. The first applies to everyone who works at Platformer; the latter contains additional information about me.

Platformer ethics

When we make a mistake, we strive to correct the error promptly and disclose the correction to readers.

We maintain the anonymity of our sources when asked to do so and when they are sharing information we believe to be in the public interest.

We do not, and would never, accept payment to write about any company on Platformer. Nor will we accept paid consulting assignments or speaking opportunities at the companies we cover.

We may run an ad in the free weekly edition of Platformer. Companies we cover are not eligible to advertise, and advertisers have no editorial control what we write about. For more on this subject, see our advertising policy.

Platformer is hosted on Ghost Pro. When we moved to Ghost, we took advantage of its free migration services. We do not receive any financial subsidies from Ghost.

Platformer was formerly hosted on Substack, a platform that we write about from time to time. Substack provided me with design resources and a healthcare subsidy when I started the publication.

We pay for all of our own travel and expenses while covering company events.

We do not accept gifts of more than minimal value from companies. We do sometimes keep the odd branded coffee cup, pair of socks, or T-shirt.

We may sometimes acquire small amounts of cryptocurrency to better understand and report on companies and trends. We will disclose this if we do so. We will not acquire cryptocurrency for the purposes of trading, staking, or speculation. If, despite our best efforts, our crypto holdings temporarily rise above $1,000 in value, we will disclose this.

We sometimes accept free trials of paid software to better understand the industry we cover. The same holds true for hardware, although rarely. If we find ourselves using any review software or hardware on a regular basis, we will buy the device for ourselves.

Casey Newton’s ethics

I do not hold any individual stocks in any companies, including but not limited to the ones I write about. I do have a 401(k) and other retirement accounts that invest in a wide range of stocks, but I have no control over their contents.

I do own some stock options in Vox Media, where I worked at full time from 2013 to 2020 and was a contributing editor until 2023. If the company is sold or goes public, I would benefit financially. I don’t plan to disclose this relationship every time I link to a story from a Vox outlet, since I do that on most days. But whenever I write about Vox or The Verge as institutions, I’ll disclose that in the piece.

I co-host Hard Fork, a podcast produced by the New York Times. I don’t plan to disclose this relationship every time I link to a Times story, since I do that on most days. But whenever I write about the Times as an institution, I’ll disclose that in the piece.

In January 2025 my boyfriend began work as a software engineer at Anthropic, the artificial intelligence company behind the chatbot Claude. He found and applied for this job independently of me, and Anthropic was unaware of our relationship during the application process.

While he works at Anthropic, my boyfriend will not disclose confidential information about the company to me, nor will he be a source for me in my reporting. His own work lies outside my core focus on product and policy.

We live together, and share household expenses. Otherwise, we maintain separate finances.

Here is how I share this disclosure:

Emailing a link to it to all new subscribers.

Publishing this disclosure in the newsletter, at platformer.news/ethics, and updating it whenever circumstances warrant it.

Adding a permanent link to my ethics disclosure on the Platformer home page.

Adding a permanent link to my ethics disclosure in every edition of Platformer.

Linking to the disclosure at the top of any column that primarily concerns Anthropic, its competitors, or the AI industry at large. (In the latter cases, I intend to do this even when the column does not specifically mention Anthropic.)

I welcome reader comments on this disclosure and how it might be improved. Please send them to casey@platformer.news.

        <hr/>
        Once a summer for the past few years, I've taken a break from the news cycle to share a little about how I use technology to do my job. (Here's last year, and the year before.) Readers often tell me they look forward to posts like these, and so in the spirit of giving you more of what you want, here's what I learned about productivity in the past year.

Just like last year, I'll offer a couple recommendations for software tools I've recently started using. (None of these recommendations are sponsored, incidentally.) But in an effort to offer a more complete picture of what it's like for me these days to get things done as a journalist and entrepreneur, I also want to talk about what I'm still doing, what I stopped doing, and why.

Let's get into it.

What I'm still doing

In my experience, most people use software tools only begrudgingly, and will go to great lengths to avoid ever having to learn a new one. For some percentage of tech enthusiasts, though, trying out new software is a hobby all unto itself.

I count myself among this pathological second group, and will regularly drop everything to try out a new to-do app for no productive reason at all. For that reason, I think, the strongest case I can make for you about which software tools are truly useful involve the ones that I have continued to use for more than a year.

With that in mind, I'm happy to say I'm still a more-or-less daily user of two apps I told you about last year.

Raycast, a launcher app I began using on my Mac, continues to make navigating my laptop effortless. I simply type ⌘-space and can instantly open an app, perform a calculation, reposition my windows, access my clipboard history, look up a word's definition, and dozens of other things. But my favorite use of Raycast is still asking quick questions of AI (a paid upgrade): without ever leaving the tab I'm on, I can look up a quick fact, jog my memory, or get more context. And yes, I double-check any fact it gives me before putting it in the newsletter. But the amount of time and energy I save in context-switching continues to make Raycast a cherished companion.

Raycast came to iOS this year, but in truth, I haven't found much use for it. The better news is that it is soon coming to Windows as well; you can sign up for the waitlist here.

Capacities, a personal knowledge management app, continues to be my home base for daily planning, journaling, and lightweight task management. The app offers extensive features for folks who like to have dedicated structures and metadata for keeping track of the books they read, the people they meet, and the places they travel. It also has integrated AI chat, integrations with Todoist and other third-party apps, and a growing library of plug-ins built by its community.

I've dabbled with those features, but none have stuck. What brings me back to Capacities is the value I find in taking a few minutes most mornings to write in my journal about work, life, and whatever else is on my mind. This clears my head and makes space for me to make a plan for the day, while also letting me noodle on ideas for the column and the podcast.

I still do some lightweight tagging of people, topics, and ideas. But I've also come to trust my memory more; it turns out that my mind returning to a subject over and over again is a much more useful signal to me than seeing that I keep tagging the same idea or subject all over again. Or rather, by the time I'm tagging the same idea over and over in Capacities, it has already occurred to me that it's something to write about. And how hard would have it been to find all those stories I so meticulously added and tagged, anyway?

What I stopped doing

Last year I talked about my experiments with Readwise, which I hoped would become a kind of AI librarian. The idea was that it would become a kind of next-generation Pocket, replacing the now-defunct read-it-later app with something more dynamic. It was especially useful at quickly parsing large PDFs, such as court decisions or NGO reports, allowing me to summarize and find relevant parts of the document much faster than I could do myself.

It didn't stick. Like Pocket, Readwise turned out to be less of a read-it-later app than a read-it-never app — a place to save articles, books and other media with the best of intentions, and then never to look at it ever again. Summarizing and navigating through PDFs is now something any chatbot will do for you, and for free.

Abandoning Readwise is part of an overall move I am making to collecting less stuff. In the past, it seemed obvious that slurping up every item of remote interest into a single database would eventually reap huge rewards for my intellect. And while I continue to investigate new approaches to that question — see below — on the whole I am trying to do less of it.

I experimented with Lazy; I spent the past six months keeping a journal of stories about AI in Tana. The best thing I can say about these experiences is that they made it modestly easier to jog my memory about recent events involving a certain company or topic, thanks to the work I had put into tagging them. But doing so required a lot of manual effort, and for only a modest reward.

How I'm using AI

Last month 404 Media's Jason Koebler wrote something that has haunted me ever since: "Where are the journalists who were formerly middling who are now pumping out incredible articles thanks to efficiencies granted by AI?" Koebler's question came as part of a broadside against feckless media executives betting that artificial intelligence will somehow save their businesses despite all current evidence to the contrary. But he also cast doubt on the idea that AI is transformative even at the individual level. I found myself agreeing with him.

Like Koebler, I believe that AI is no kind of business model for journalism; and that any efficiencies that individual reporters are seeing from it are relatively modest. There is nothing that AI now does for me that I could not do myself.

That said, there are things that AI does for me that I would now hate to do myself, and hope never to do again. There are also some things it can do better than I can, in most cases because it's simply much faster. Here are some of those things:

Thinking models have gotten surprisingly good at identifying potential sources — potentially academic ones. When writing about Grok last month, I wanted to talk to someone who had studied relationships between people and chatbots. ChatGPT led me to Harvard's Center for Digital Thriving, and suggested someone to talk to, along with their email address. I wound up interviewing them for the piece. The fact that thinking models can quickly analyze the academic literature about any subject and identify prominent researchers on the subject, along with their email addresses and phone numbers, is beginning to save me a lot of Googling.

Often when writing about a topic, I need examples to make my point. I find that thinking models are really good at "finding a time when." "Find examples of previous times that an AI company caused a backlash by cutting off access to a model with no warning," is one I used recently. ChatGPT and Gemini make easy work of this kind of question, and cite high-quality sources that I can actually use. It saves me time.

Similarly, I'll use thinking models to "summarize reactions to" things. It used to be that I could simply look at Twitter to understand the conversation about the top tech stories of the day. But Twitter is dead now, and social media is fragmented. And so recently when I wanted to gauge early reaction to Perplexity's Comet browser, I asked ChatGPT to summarize early reviews. It quickly gave me a good range of perspectives.

A lot of what I do at Platformer involves news analysis. Lately, I've been telling thinking models to read three or four stories, and then suggest connections between them, or unanswered questions that I ought to pursue. If you have a good human editor, they will often do this for you, and give you a head start as you set off reporting and writing. As my own editor, though, I appreciate the ability to use the model as a kind of backstop. I find this is true even and especially when its ideas are bad — as most millennials know by now, nothing spurs you to write quite like seeing something wrong on the internet.

Each day before publishing, I ask one or two thinking models to analyze my column for spelling, grammatical, and factual errors. This is something that has gotten significantly better over the past year. Last August, bots routinely told me I had made mistakes that were not even in the text I submitted; they also could not access the web for fact-checking purposes. Now they can — and the emails I get from readers pointing out typos and other mistakes have notably declined. Of course, I also fact-check these columns myself, but everyone benefits from another set of eyes — even virtual ones.

For what it's worth, my most-used models are GPT-5 thinking (previously o3), and Gemini 2.5 Pro. GPT-5 is my daily workhorse, but I also think Gemini is underrated. (Did you know you can upload an audio file to it and it will create a very good transcription for you, and even clean up the filler words?) I find Claude less useful for the tasks above, but I do use it for personal stuff; it has the highest EQ of today's models. (See my ethics disclosure!)

And before anyone asks — I do not use AI to draft columns or even to draft outlines. I started a newsletter because I like to write!

What I'm trying

Two years ago, I wrote this:

Within some reasonable period of time, I expect that I will be able to talk to my Notion database as if it’s ChatGPT. If I could, I imagine I would talk to it all the time.

Much of journalism simply involves remembering relevant events from the past. An AI-powered link database has a perfect memory; all it’s missing is a usable chat interface. If it had one, it might be a perfect research assistant.

This feature actually shipped a few months later. My early experiments with it had not gone well. But after interviewing Notion CEO Ivan Zhao for Decoder this month, I gave it another shot. And I'm happy to say that Notion delivered exactly what I was looking for in 2023: the ability to talk to the giant database of links I have stored in it over the past five years, grounded in the actual links and article text I have saved.

I can give Notion a sprawling question like "how did the Cambridge Analytica case resolve" and get a good summary of regulatory actions across several years and countries. And by default, web search is off, meaning I know that its AI systems are drawing only on the vetted journalism that I have saved into my database.

This is a dream come true. I finally have a meaningful way to sift through millions of words of article text, ask follow-up questions, and get citations that I can use in my work. Notion may yet prove to be the AI librarian that Readwise never became.

One more thing I'm trying: I mentioned above that I continue to experiment with different ways to save material that might be useful later. Recently a Reddit post turned me on to Recall, which positions itself as a "self-organizing knowledge base." Currently available as a web and mobile app, Recall lets you save web pages, YouTube videos, PDFs, podcasts, Google Docs, and other materials into a single database that it then organizes on your behalf.

Recall is largely redundant to Notion. But I love its interface, its speed, and its overall user experience. Lately, the CEOs I cover have all started doing two- to three-hour podcast recordings. With Recall, I can save the podcast with one click, have it instantly generate a summarized transcript with timestamps, and let the app automatically connect it to other relevant articles and podcasts in my database. It performs similarly well with PDFs of books, which I rarely have the time to read in their entirety, but can now skim using Recall's detailed summaries and decide whether I want to dig in deeper.

Recall aims itself in part at students — it will also generate quizzes for you based on the material you save. And like basically every other productivity app today, it also has integrated AI chat, so you can ask questions about long documents and get grounded answers. I haven't been using Recall for long, but for the moment it is scratching my web-hoarding itch unlike anything else has quite been able to do to date.

In conclusion

If I've learned one bitter lesson about this stuff over the years, it's that the best productivity hack in the world is simply liking your job. If you enjoy what you do, you will find ways to do it, and in 2025 almost any software remotely suited to the purpose will be more than good enough. On a fundamental level, every single to-do list app is exactly the same.

But it's fun to try new things. And while I continue to waste countless hours and a fair bit of money doing so, I also feel like this pursuit keeps me connected to the state of the art. The Notion workspace I dreamed of two years ago is now here at my fingertips. The looming question, as ever, is what I will do with it.

On the podcast this week: Kevin and I explore what it means that we're in an AI bubble. Then, Reuters' Jeff Horwitz stops by to discuss his blockbuster story about Meta's policy to let its chatbot engage in "sensual" roleplay with children. And finally, I introduce Kevin to the wild world of "shock slop" — AI-generated songs meant to freak out your parents.

Also: thanks to Left of the Dial for naming Hard Fork one of its 100 best podcasts of all time!

This article answers some frequently asked questions about Recommended stories on the Firefox New Tab page on both computers and mobile devices.

Recommended stories on the Firefox New Tab page is a feature currently available in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, France, Spain, and India. We’re working to bring it to other countries.

Why am I seeing these stories, from these publishers, on the Firefox New Tab page?

Firefox’s recommendations elevate content that is worthy of your time and attention – that informs, inspires, entertains, and offers new and unique perspectives. Firefox’s recommendations team works with custom machine learning algorithms to surface the most compelling content from around the web, drawing on a wide array of sources with a track record of trustworthy and accurate coverage.

Are these stories on the New Tab page personalized to me?

For the most part, no. Most recommendations on your New Tab page come from a general list of the best stories on the web. But Firefox is actively working on ways to deliver personalized recommendations in a way that vigorously protects users’ privacy. Importantly, Mozilla never receives a copy of your browser history. When personalization does occur, recommendations rely on a process of story sorting and filtering that happens locally in your personal copy of Firefox.

What information is collected when I interact with Recommended stories?

By default, when stories recommended by Firefox are displayed on your New Tab page, we collect information about how many times they appear and how many times they are clicked. You can learn more about how to manage how your data is collected.

Firefox partners with select publishers and brands to deliver high-quality sponsored content and advertisements to our users. This content will always be clearly marked, and you have control over whether it is shown on your New Tab page.

If you prefer to not see a sponsored story on your New Tab page, you can easily dismiss it by selecting the three-dot button next to the recommendations and clicking Dismiss. You can also permanently opt-out of viewing sponsored stories by following the instructions here.

Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us. Except for an aggregated total count of impressions and clicks that a particular item receives, sponsors do not receive any additional data from Mozilla. We do not collect personally identifying data through these interactions, nor do we share it with our sponsors.

Many stories remain relevant beyond 24 hours. Firefox elevates content that’s interesting and relevant regardless of publication date.

I don’t want to see recommended stories on my New Tab page. How do I turn this off?

To hide recommended stories in Firefox on your computer or mobile device, follow these instructions:

If you don’t like a piece of content that was recommended, you can dismiss it from the menu that appears when you select the three-dot button at the top right corner of the tile.

Why does an article recommended to me have a paywall?

What is a paywall?

A paywall is a way to restrict access to certain online content. Some publishers use it to encourage readers to log in or subscribe to be able to view their articles.

Websites can implement two kinds of paywalls:

A soft paywall that lets readers view a limited number of articles before prompting them to log in or subscribe.

A hard paywall that blocks viewing any content without subscribing first.

Why might I see an article with a Paywall in Recommended stories?

From time to time, you may encounter a Recommended story that is from a site that utilizes paywalls. Our policy is to not recommend content that’s behind hard paywalls, but we will include recommendations from sites that use soft paywalls.

Our aim is to recommend the best of the web by connecting readers with stories that are worthy of their time and attention, and this policy means that we can connect these stories with the widest possible audience.

If you hit a paywall when trying to view a story, it’s likely you have already hit your maximum number of stories allotted by that publisher. At that point, you can choose to subscribe to the publisher if you’d like, or move on to the next article.

What if I want to opt out of data collection?

Firefox collects technical and usage data by default, but you can turn this off at any time.

In the Menu bar at the top of the screen, click Firefox and select Settings (select Preferences on older macOS versions).Click the menu button and select Settings.

Select the Privacy & Security panel.

Scroll down to the Firefox Data Collection and Use section.

Uncheck the box next to Allow Firefox to send technical and interaction data to Mozilla.

To learn more about what data Mozilla receives and how it's used, see Mozilla's Firefox Privacy Notice.

        How is your data used?

To provide you with the Firefox browser

Mozilla collects certain data, like technical and settings data, to provide the core functionality of the Firefox browser and associated services, distinguish your device from others, remember and respect your settings, and provide you with default features such as New Tab, PDF editing, password manager and Total Cookie Protection. You can further customize your Firefox experience by adjusting your controls, buttons, and toolbars and adding features with add-ons.

Some Firefox features, like automated translation for web pages and “alt-text” suggestions when you upload images in your PDFs, are powered by artificial intelligence (AI) based on small language models downloaded to your device. These operate locally — web page content, PDFs, images and tab URLs stay on your device and are not sent to Mozilla’s servers or used for training purposes without your explicit consent. Note that other Firefox features may integrate third-party AI models, as further detailed in this Notice.

To adapt Firefox to your needs

Firefox processes a variety of personal data in a way that does not leave your device, such as browsing history, web form data, temporary internet files, and cookies. This means the data stays on your device and is not sent to Mozilla’s servers unless it says otherwise in this Notice. If you choose to allow it, your precise location may also be processed for location-related functionality for websites like Google Maps; this data is only accessed from your device by the website(s) you choose to enable it for — it is not sent to Mozilla’s servers.

If you choose to enable the Shake to Summarize feature in Firefox mobile on a device with Apple Intelligence (iPhone 15 Pro+ with iOS 26+), summarizations will be created locally on your device when you request them. If you enable it on a device without Apple Intelligence, your page content will be sent to a Mozilla server for processing when you request a summary, and the summary will be returned to your device; Mozilla does not store this content or resulting summaries.

More details, including how to adjust your data settings: Data processed on your device remains in your control. You can manage your browsing data and your local storage settings, or update your location permissions at any time.

Provide and improve search functionality and suggestions

As you type a search query within Firefox, Firefox offers search suggestions to provide you with faster and more direct access to what you’re looking for. Some of the search suggestions come from your search provider (“Search Suggestions”). Others come from Firefox, and are based on information stored on your local device (including recent search terms, open tabs, and previously visited URLs), or content from Mozilla and Mozilla’s partners, including paid sponsors and internet resources like Wikipedia (“Suggestions from Firefox”).

By default, Firefox shows Search Suggestions. Suggestion requests — including your real-time search query and technical data — are sent directly to your search provider as you type, and processed according to your search provider’s privacy notice (linked below). You can turn off Search Suggestions or change your default search provider at any time, as outlined on this Firefox Support page.

Users in the United States and certain other regions will also receive Suggestions from Firefox. You can turn these off entirely, or just turn off sponsored Suggestions from Firefox, in your browser settings.

In the United States, Firefox fetches suggestions from Mozilla’s servers as you type your query. We use a privacy preserving technology called OHTTP, which combines encryption and a proxy server to conceal your IP address and other identifying information. Your real-time search query, along with technical, interaction, and IP-derived location data are passed through this OHTTP proxy by default before being sent to Mozilla. This helps prevent anyone (including Mozilla) from associating your specific query with you, or from combining it with unrelated information about your browsing activity. Mozilla processes this data to serve you relevant suggestions, understand how useful the suggestions are to you, and improve the service. In some circumstances Mozilla’s partners will receive de-identified search and interaction data, in order to serve relevant suggestions and measure user engagement with suggested content.

Some users — including users in some regions outside the U.S. and U.S.-based users who deselect “retrieve Suggestions from Mozilla as you type” in their settings — will instead receive locally processed results when using the Suggestions from Firefox feature. For these users, the suggestions will be served locally, using information stored on your device, in your copy of Firefox. Your de-identified click and interaction data for specific query keywords (but not your search query) are sent to Mozilla via OHTTP to conceal your IP address and other identifying information. For sponsored suggestions, our partners may receive aggregated information about which of their suggestions are shown and clicked on, but not which users saw the suggestions or which keywords caused those suggestions to be served. (If Suggestions from Firefox are unavailable in your region, you will only receive suggestions Search Suggestions).

Serve relevant content and advertising on Firefox New Tab

Firefox shows content on New Tab, along with advertising to support its development. You can turn these off at any time in your browser settings.

We use technical data, language preference, and IP-derived location to serve this content in the correct format (i.e. for mobile vs desktop), language, and relevant location. Mozilla collects technical and interaction data, such as the position, size, views and clicks on New Tab content or ads, to understand how people are interacting with our content and to personalize future content, including sponsored content. This data may be shared with our advertising partners on an aggregated and/or de-identified basis.

In some regions, we use this data to build models and group users based on common attributes. These groupings help us understand how people are interacting with our content and to personalize future content, including sponsored content. We use on-device processing and OHTTP to avoid revealing to Mozilla the attributes of any specific user. Learn more.

We also work with advertising providers to deliver relevant sponsored content using programmatic technologies. To support this, we may share limited, non-identifying information — such as device type, IP-derived location information, and category of content viewed — to help determine which ads to display. We don’t share any information that identifies you. You can turn off sponsored content in your New Tab settings at any time.

In some cases, when ads are enabled on New Tab, additional browsing and interaction data (including interactions with our advertisers) may also be processed locally on your device to measure the effectiveness of those ads; the shortcuts feature also uses browsing data locally on your device to select top shortcuts, some of which may be sponsored. Any such data will only be shared with Mozilla and/or our advertising partners via our privacy-preserving technologies on an aggregated and/or de-identified basis.

When a user visits a third-party website by clicking an advertisement or link in Firefox, that site may use cookies and other web APIs available to any website to collect data subject to that website’s privacy and/or cookie notices.

You can turn off or customize any of these New Tab features along with their associated data processing in your browser settings (Desktop, Android, iOS). You can also disable sponsored content while continuing to use the rest of the features.

Provide Mozilla accounts

If you sign up for a Mozilla account, we process additional information alongside the data set out in this Notice, such as account details, contact information and sync data, in accordance with the Mozilla Accounts Privacy Notice.

Provide AI chatbots

You have the option to use a third-party AI chatbot of your choice to help you with things like summarizing what you’re reading, writing, and brainstorming ideas, subject to that provider’s terms of use and privacy notice.

If you choose to enable a chatbot in the sidebar and/or through a shortcut, Mozilla does not have access to your conversations or the underlying content you input into the selected chatbot. We do collect technical and interaction data on how this feature is used to help improve Firefox, such as how often each third-party chatbot provider is chosen, how often suggested prompts are used, and the length of selected text.

More details, including how to adjust your data settings: You can read more about how to manage or remove AI chatbots in Firefox.

Provide and enable add-ons (addons.mozilla.org)

You can install add-ons from addons.mozilla.org (“AMO”) or from the Firefox Add-ons Manager, which is accessible from the Firefox menu button in the toolbar. We process your search queries in the Add-ons Manager to be able to provide you with suggested add-ons. If you choose to install any add-ons, Firefox will process technical, IP-derived location, and settings data, and periodically connect with Mozilla’s servers to install and apply the correct updates to your add-ons. We also collect technical and interaction data on usage of add-ons, to help improve Firefox.

When you visit the AMO website, Mozilla collects technical and interaction data about your usage of the site in accordance with our Mozilla Websites, Communications and Cookies notice.

More details, including how to adjust your data settings: Learn how to remove or enable add-ons. You can also review the Privacy Notice for the add-ons website.

Maintain and improve features, performance and stability

Mozilla runs studies within Firefox and makes certain experimental features available through Firefox Labs to test different features and ideas before they’re made available to all Firefox users or become part of the core Firefox offering — this allows us to make more informed decisions about what our users want and need. This research uses technical, system performance, IP-derived location, settings and interaction data.

We also need to process data to keep Firefox operational, improve features and performance, and identify, troubleshoot and diagnose issues. For this we use technical, IP-derived location, and settings data, as well as interaction and system performance data (such as number of tabs open, memory usage or the outcome of automated processes like updates). In the rare situations where the information needed also includes limited browsing data (e.g., Top Level Domain annotations for page-load performance monitoring), it will be transmitted using OHTTP; this helps prevent Mozilla from linking you or your device to the data collected for this purpose.

On desktop and Android, if Firefox encounters an unexpected issue, the Mozilla Crash Reporter will also ask if you wish to send us additional information, which may include sites that were open at the time of the crash and other browsing data. On Desktop and Android if you opt in to sending us crash reports automatically, we collect this information without prompting you each time; on iOS, crash reports contain less information and are sent automatically to us by default. You can change your settings at any time.

More details, including how to adjust your data settings: You can learn more about the studies you’re enrolled in and opt out of all (or a specific) studies at any time, and opt into experimental features through Firefox Labs. You can also learn more about the technical and interaction data we process, including how to turn it off.

Improve security

Because maintaining the latest version of Firefox helps keep you safe against vulnerabilities, desktop versions of Firefox regularly connect to Mozilla’s servers (or another service that you used to install Firefox) to check for software updates; updates for Android and iOS versions of Firefox are managed by Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store, respectively.

We also process technical data and settings data to protect against malicious add-ons. In addition to these standard processes, we use Google’s Safe Browsing Service to protect you from malicious downloads and phishing attacks, and validate webpage and technical data with Certificate Authorities. As part of our work to improve privacy and security for all internet users, we collect technical data via OHTTP, to better understand, prevent and defend against fingerprinting.

For some Firefox users, Firefox routes DNS requests to a resolver service that has agreed to Mozilla’s strict privacy standards for resolvers. This provides added protection from privacy leaks to local networks and also from certain DNS security attacks. System logs of your DNS requests are deleted from the service within 24 hours and are only used for the purpose of DNS resolution. Learn more about DNS over HTTPS.

Understand usage of Firefox

We process data to better understand how you engage with our services, such as how much you use Firefox, your language preference, how often you use our search tools or interact with search suggestions, how fast pages load for you and how many ads or CAPTCHAs you see. This allows us to measure how people access and use our services, which helps improve our business and the functionality of Firefox.

More details, including how to adjust your data settings: You can update your data collection settings for Desktop and Mobile at any time. Note that deselecting “Allow Firefox to send technical and interaction data to Mozilla” will not impact the Daily Usage Ping. This Daily Usage Ping solely provides us with de-identified information that a user is using Firefox; it is not tied to any other data about you and you can opt out in settings.

Market our services

When you allow us to do so, Firefox sends Mozilla data about the website domain or specific advertising campaign (if any) that referred you to our download page to help us understand and improve our marketing efforts. Firefox also shares information with our marketing partners to measure and improve these campaigns; what information is specifically shared varies (depending on how you discovered Firefox and your operating system) but generally includes how you were referred to our download page and whether you actively use Firefox. When Firefox is pre-installed on your device, technical and interaction data (your device type and whether Firefox is used) will be sent to our marketing partners, and shared with Mozilla.

More details, including how to adjust your data settings: Learn more about what Campaign Measurement data is collected and shared, and how to opt out. Firefox does not share information like your browsing history, search queries, or saved passwords with marketing technology partners. Mozilla only collects the data necessary to measure and improve our marketing campaigns.

To pseudonymize, de-identify, aggregate or anonymize data

As part of the activities outlined above, such as understanding usage of Firefox and measuring our marketing, we may create pseudonymous, de-identified, aggregated or anonymized data. We use technology that is appropriate to the circumstances, including identifier removal, OHTTP, or DAP — these help prevent data from being linked to you. In some cases, we may share or publish aggregated and anonymized data to facilitate research or as part of the lawful business purposes outlined above (such as sharing aggregated insights with advertising partners).

Communicate with you

Depending on your settings (and whether or not you have a Mozilla account), we may communicate with you via in-product messaging, send you communications (including marketing-related communications), ask you to participate in research / surveys, or respond to customer support communications. You may also reach out to us directly, such as to report a broken site within Firefox. When you communicate with us via these methods, we will only use the information you share for the purpose you provided it. We also process interaction data related to these communications to better understand who has received our service-related announcements (such as new features, updates or security alerts).

When you visit Mozilla’s help pages in connection with Firefox, Mozilla collects technical and interaction data about your usage of our websites in accordance with our Mozilla Websites, Communications and Cookies notice to enable us to understand your usage of our support and help pages and improve them.

Comply with applicable laws, and identify and prevent harmful, unauthorized or illegal activity

We may also be required to process your personal data to comply with applicable laws and protection purposes, such as:

Responding to lawful requests and complying with legal processes, such as responding to subpoenas, investigations, or requests from government authorities. Mozilla requires a valid Legal Process to compel the disclosure of specific user data to a government.

Responding to requests to exercise privacy rights, such as your right to access or delete your personal data.

Identifying, investigating and addressing potential fraudulent activities, or other harmful activities such as illegal activities, cyberattacks or intellectual property infringement (including filing or defending legal claims).

Performing internal compliance and security activities, such as audits and enterprise security management.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> The author explores the utility of Claude Code for non-programmers, reflecting on Andrej Karpathy's prediction that English is the hottest new programming language. By utilizing natural language instructions, the writer successfully built a personal website and several custom research tools, illustrating a shift in LLM usage from simple text generation to functional tool creation.

        <hr/>
        This is a column about Claude Code. My boyfriend works at Anthropic. See my full ethics disclosure here.

Three years ago this month, the prominent AI researcher and commentator Andrej Karpathy declared that “the hottest new programming language is English.” At the time, ChatGPT was less than two months old, and millions of people were discovering that natural language could now be used to generate code. GPT-3.5 had demonstrated that large language models could follow complex instructions with increasing reliability. Karpathy’s tweet predicted a world where knowledge of a programming language would no longer be required to program.

At the time, I remember a CEO friend of mine gently scoffing at the idea of English as a programming language. As the leader of an engineering team, he spent all day “programming” in English: giving projects to his engineers and telling them what to build. The method was less reliable than you might expect, he told me. In the eternal quest to build digital products by describing them in words, something almost always gets lost in translation.

Over the next three years, the CEO’s experience matched my own. English is the only language in which I am fluent, and for the most part it made for a poor programming language. Unable to write anything more complicated than HTML, I found that the advent of vibe coding (another Karpathy coinage) largely passed me by. After every major new model release, I would dutifully ask it to build me some basic but ultimately useless piece of software. Programming remained something other people did.

As I noted last week, the release of Claude Opus 4.5 in Claude Code changed that. In just about an hour of typing into a box — of programming in English, as Karpathy put it — I made a personal website that far surpassed anything I had been able to put together in Squarespace. Like my CEO friend’s engineers, Claude regularly made strange choices and outright errors that I would have to correct. Without too much effort, though, I was able to get the site that I asked for — as well as several features I never would have thought to build had Claude not suggested them.

In the week since, amid a general craze for Claude Code, I have let my imagination run wild. In just a few days, I built a series of tools I expect to return to over and over again to help me in my work. As with my website, I don’t understand the underlying code at all. But for the moment, anyway, I’m not certain it matters.

ChatGPT was the moment when people woke up to the power of LLMs to generate text. The Claude Code moment, while orders of magnitude smaller, strikes me as potentially just as significant. It's waking people up to LLMs' power to generate tools. And I suspect the consequences of this strange new ability will reverberate over the next several years.

In the spirit of showing rather than telling, today I wanted to share a few of the things I’ve built for myself as a writer. Some are tools I’ve wanted for years. Others were suggested by Claude itself. All are things that I would not have been able to create before a few months ago.

A couple caveats up top. One is that I’m not interested in AI tools that do the writing for me. I occasionally experiment with trying to get models to write in my voice, for the same reason you might check the area surrounding your tent for grizzly bears before camping for the night. But I’m almost always more interested in tools that improve my thinking, rather than substitute for it.

That’s why you’ll note that a common thread running through these tools is that they help me make sense of things. To cover technology is to be at the center of a sprawling collection of characters, events, narratives, and history. Tools that help me capture and organize them are invaluable to me.

Second, given my conflict of interest, I realize today’s edition may come across as wide-eyed Claude-glazing. Should that be a concern, I encourage you to swap out Claude for OpenAI’s similar Codex or Google’s Antigravity, both of which should be capable of building software of similar quality. My goal here is not to persuade you to use any particular framework to tackle your project; it’s simply to suggest what is newly possible.

If nothing else, Claude Code fulfills a desperate need that every writer has at one time or another: to procrastinate. So, with that said, here are some things writers can build with the tools now available — along with some notes on the obstacles I still find myself running into.

Build a website. While I covered this last week, it’s worth saying that I think a website is the ideal place to start after downloading Claude Code. Every writer can benefit from having a website, and you probably already have a few things in mind for what might belong there. (If you don’t, ask Claude for some ideas.)

Building a website with Claude Code will help familiarize you with the basic rhythms of this work. Type what you want into the box; Claude either goes forth and does it or asks follow-up questions to help you refine your idea. Look at the resulting product, then tell Claude what you want it to change.

The best part about this project is that you don’t even have to publish the site Claude makes for you — you can just spend an hour or so building something locally and tweaking it to your liking.

If you do like what you build, you can publish your site more cheaply than you would on Squarespace using a service like Netlify (which I’m using at the moment) or GitHub Pages. As a bonus, you can integrate a simple blog onto your site. I used micro.blog.

Where Claude falls short: If you’re working on local files, Claude moves very quickly. If it has to debug anything in your browser, though, it will go much more slowly, and ask for permission at every step of the way. I implemented a simple website in about an hour; the blog, which involved lots of Code poking around in various online services in Chrome tabs, was a half-day project. There was probably a faster way to do it, and I’ll never know what it is!

Build a searchable database of your own work. I’ve always wanted a database of my writing that I could run semantic queries on. Stuff like: “When was the last time I wrote a column about Grok?” Or, “what criticisms have people made of the Meta Oversight Board?” It is possible to get answers to these questions via Google. But I’ve always wanted answers grounded in my own work, with quick links to the relevant materials.

The 2026 Olympics are set to be the most geographically widespread Games in history, the first to span multiple regions and two host cities: Milan and Cortina, which are about 250 miles apart from each other by road.

Over the course of two and a half weeks, athletes in 16 sports will compete in events at 25 venues.

The action is divided among four main clusters across northern Italy: Milan, Cortina d'Ampezzo, Valtellina and Val di Fiemme. Athletes will live in one of six Olympic Villages throughout the region: Milan, Cortina, Anterselva, Bormio, Livigno and Predazzo.

"This approach allows the maximum use of existing venues, reducing the need for new construction and, as a consequence, minimising the carbon footprint," states the International Olympic Committee on Olympics.com.

The competition venues span an area covering some 8,495 square miles. Getting between towns could take more than a few hours by car — especially on remote, wintery roads.

Sarah Hirshland, CEO of the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee, says spectators hoping to attend events in person should be realistic about the time and distance required to get between venues and should plan accordingly.

"I think this will be the classic 'pack your patience,' because there will be some travel time," she said.

Even if you're watching from afar, it's still helpful to know which events are happening where. Here's a guide to the 2026 Olympic venues.

Milan: Opening ceremony, skating and hockey

Milan is a major financial hub in Italy, not to mention a global capital of fashion and design. This is the first time it will host the Olympic Games, kicking off the opening ceremony and housing most of the indoor sports.

The opening ceremony on Feb. 6 will be hosted at Milan's iconic San Siro Stadium. The stadium — known as the Temple of Football — is home to the city's two main soccer clubs, AC Milan and Inter Milan, and marks its 100th anniversary in 2026.

Figure skating and short track will take place at the Milano Ice Skating Arena, known as the Unipol Forum, located in the small town of Assago, less than 2 miles outside Milan.

Ice hockey is spread across two venues, the temporary Milano Rho Ice Hockey Arena and the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena. The latter is the only new permanent venue constructed for the Games.

Speed skating will be hosted at the Milano Speed Skating Stadium.

Cortina d'Ampezzo: Sliding sports and women's Alpine skiing

Cortina, a prestigious resort town in the Dolomite Mountains, is known for its Alpine scenery and winter sports. The "Pearl of the Dolomites" has hosted the Winter Games before, in 1956.

Alpine skiing will take place at Tofane Alpine Skiing Centre, named after one of the most dramatic mountain groups in the Eastern Dolomites. Many competitors will be familiar with the Olympia delle Tofane — the ski run became a permanent fixture on the women's World Cup circuit in downhill and super-G in the early 1990s and also served as the venue for the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships in 2021.

Curling events will take place at the Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium, which hosted many of the indoor events at the 1956 Games. This time around, the venue will also host the Paralympics closing ceremony.

Bobsled, luge and skeleton are all happening at the new Cortina Sliding Centre, built on the grounds of the historic track used in 1956. It has already been chosen as a competition venue for the 2028 Winter Youth Olympic Games.

The biathlon will take place in the Antholz valley, about 30 miles north of Cortina, near the border with Austria. The Anterselva Biathlon Arena has the largest spectator capacity of any of this year's Olympic venues, set to accommodate up to 19,000 people per session.

Valtellina: Freestyle skiing, snowboarding, ski mountaineering and men's Alpine skiing

Valtellina Valley is in the Lombardy region of northern Italy, bordering Switzerland, and is known for its skiing, cheeses and wine. The towns of Bormio and Livigno will host several outdoor events.

Men's Alpine skiing, as well as the new sport of ski mountaineering, are happening in Bormio, a historic ski resort in the Italian Alps. The Stelvio Ski Centre will crown the men's downhill skiing champions and host the one new sport making its Olympic debut this year.

Freestyle skiing and snowboard events will take place at two venues — Livigno Aerials & Moguls Park and Livigno Snow Park — in Livigno, near the border with Switzerland.

Val di Fiemme: Cross-country skiing and ski jumping

Val di Fiemme is a valley in the eastern Trentino province, known for its museums, hiking and cross-country skiing. Olympic events in the cluster are spread across two of its villages, Tesero and Predazzo.

Cross-country skiing and Nordic combined events — as well as Para biathlon and Para cross-country skiing — will take place at the renowned Tesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium, which has nearly 12 miles of trails and one of the bigger spectator capacities, at 15,000. It has been a landmark for cross-country skiing since it hosted the Nordic World Ski Championships in 1991.

Ski jumping competitions and the jumping segment of the Nordic combined events will take place at the renovated Predazzo Ski Jumping Stadium, which has two main competition hills, three smaller training jumps, a new judges' tower and a spectator capacity of 15,000.

Verona: The closing ceremony

The medieval town of Verona, in the Veneto region, is perhaps best known as the setting of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It will also be the closing site of the 2026 Olympics.

        <hr/>
        Update, January 27, 2026: Clawdbot has been renamed to Moltbot following a trademark-related request by Anthropic.

For the past week or so, I’ve been working with a digital assistant that knows my name, my preferences for my morning routine, how I like to use Notion and Todoist, but which also knows how to control Spotify and my Sonos speaker, my Philips Hue lights, as well as my Gmail. It runs on Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.5 model, but I chat with it using Telegram. I called the assistant Navi (inspired by the fairy companion of Ocarina of Time, not the besieged alien race in James Cameron’s sci-fi film saga), and Navi can even receive audio messages from me and respond with other audio messages generated with the latest ElevenLabs text-to-speech model. Oh, and did I mention that Navi can improve itself with new features and that it’s running on my own M4 Mac mini server?

If this intro just gave you whiplash, imagine my reaction when I first started playing around with Clawdbot, the incredible open-source project by Peter Steinberger (a name that should be familiar to longtime MacStories readers) that’s become very popular in certain AI communities over the past few weeks. I kept seeing Clawdbot being mentioned by people I follow; eventually, I gave in to peer pressure, followed the instructions provided by the funny crustacean mascot on the app’s website, installed Clawdbot on my new M4 Mac mini (which is not my main production machine), and connected it to Telegram.

To say that Clawdbot has fundamentally altered my perspective of what it means to have an intelligent, personal AI assistant in 2026 would be an understatement. I’ve been playing around with Clawdbot so much, I’ve burned through 180 million tokens on the Anthropic API (yikes), and I’ve had fewer and fewer conversations with the “regular” Claude and ChatGPT apps in the process. Don’t get me wrong: Clawdbot is a nerdy project, a tinkerer’s laboratory that is not poised to overtake the popularity of consumer LLMs any time soon. Still, Clawdbot points at a fascinating future for digital assistants, and it’s exactly the kind of bleeding-edge project that MacStories readers will appreciate.

Clawdbot can be overwhelming at first, so I’ll try my best to explain what it is and why it’s so exciting and fun to play around with. Clawdbot is, at a high level, two things:

An LLM-powered agent that runs on your computer and can use many of the popular models such as Claude, Gemini, etc.

A “gateway” that lets you talk to the agent using the messaging app of your choice, including iMessage, Telegram, WhatsApp and others.

The second aspect was immediately fascinating to me: instead of having to install yet another app, Clawdbot’s integration with multiple messaging services meant I could use it in an app I was already familiar with. Plus, having an assistant live in Messages or Telegram further contributes to the feeling that you’re sending requests to an actual assistant.

The “agent” part of Clawdbot is key, however. Clawdbot runs entirely on your computer, locally, and keeps its settings, preferences, user memories, and other instructions as literal folders and Markdown documents on your machine. Think of it as the equivalent of Obsidian: while there is a cloud service behind it (for Obsidian, it’s Sync; for Clawdbot, it’s the LLM provider you choose), everything else runs locally, on-device, and can be directly controlled and infinitely tweaked by you, either manually, or by asking Clawdbot to change a specific aspect of itself to suit your needs.

Which brings me to the most important – and powerful – trait of Clawdbot: because the agent is running on your computer, it has access to a shell and your filesystem. Given the right permissions, Clawdbot can execute Terminal commands, write scripts on the fly and execute them, install skills to gain new capabilities, and set up MCP servers to give itself new external integrations. Combine all this with a vibrant community that is contributing skills and plugins for Clawdbot, plus Steinberger’s own collection of command-line utilities, and you have yourself a recipe for a self-improving, steerable, and open personal agent that knows you, can access the web, runs on your local machine, and can do just about anything you can think of. All of this while communicating with it using text messages. It’s an AI nerd’s dream come true, and it’s a lot to wrap your head around at first.

To give you a sense of what’s possible: I asked Clawdbot to give itself support for generating images with Google’s Nano Banana Pro model. After it did that (Clawdbot even told me how to securely store my Gemini credentials in the native macOS Keychain), I asked Navi to give itself a profile picture that combined its original crustacean character with Navi from The Legend of Zelda. The result was a fairy crab featuring the popular “Hey, Listen!” phrase from the videogame, which it preemptively found on the web via a Google search:

I then went a step beyond: I asked Navi to assess the state of its features and use Nano Banana to create an infographic that described its structure. Since Clawdbot is running on my computer and its features are contained in folders, Clawdbot scanned its own /clawd directory in Finder, went to Nano Banana, and produced the following image:

As you can tell from the image, I’m barely scraping the surface of Clawdbot’s abilities here. “Memory files” are, effectively, daily notes formatted in Markdown that Clawdbot auto-generates each day to keep a plain text log of our interactions. This is its memory system based on Markdown which, if I wanted, I could plug into Obsidian, search with Raycast, or automate with Hazel in some other way.

The integrations are, by far, the most fun I’ve had with an LLM in recent years. In keeping with the “you can just do things” philosophy we’ve discussed on AppStories lately, if you want Clawdbot to give itself a piece of functionality that it doesn’t have by default, you can just ask it to do so, and it’ll do it for you. Case in point: a while back I shared a shortcut for Club MacStories members that quickly transcribes audio messages using the Whisper model hosted on Groq. I grabbed a link to the article, gave it to Clawd, and told it that I wanted it to give itself support for transcribing Telegram’s audio messages with that system. Two minutes later, it created a skill that adapted my shortcut for Clawd running on my Mac mini.

Then, I went a step beyond: like any good assistant, I wanted to make sure that if I issued a request with voice, Navi would also respond with voice, and if I sent a written request, Navi would reply with text. At that point, Clawdbot went off to do some research, found the ElevenLabs documentation for their new TTS model, asked me for ElevenLabs credentials, and created three test voices with different personalities for me to choose from. I chose one, fine-tuned it a little bit, and a few minutes later, Navi had a “voice” to use for future audio replies. Now, when I want to ask my assistant something but I’m busy doing something else and can’t type, I just send it a brain dump as an audio message on Telegram and, a few seconds later, I have a reply ready for me to listen to.

Being able to dictate messages in either Italian or English – or a mix of both! – for my assistant running in Telegram has been amazing – especially when you consider how the iPhone’s own Siri is still not multilingual today, let alone capable of understanding user context or performing long-running tasks in the background.

Still not impressed? How about this:

Last night, I wondered if I could replace some automations I had configured years ago on Zapier with equivalent actions running on my Mac mini via Clawd, to save some extra money each month. One of them, for instance, was a “zap” that created a project for the next issue of MacStories Weekly in my Todoist soon after we send the newsletter each Friday. It does so by checking an RSS feed, adding 1 to the issue number, and creating a new project via the Todoist API. I asked Clawd if it was possible to replicate it and, surely enough, it outlined a plan: we could set up a cron job on the Mac mini, check the RSS feed every few hours, and create a new project whenever a new issue appears in the feed. Five minutes of back and forth later, Clawd created everything on my Mac, with no cloud dependency, no subscription required – just the task I asked for, pieced together by an LLM with existing shell tools and Internet access. It makes me wonder how many automation layers and services I could replace by giving Clawd some prompts and shell access.

All of this is exhilarating and scary at the same time. More so than using the latest flavors of Claude or ChatGPT, using Clawdbot and the process of continuously shaping it for my needs and preferences has been the closest I’ve felt to a higher degree of digital intelligence in a while. I understand now why Fidji Simo, CEO of Applications at OpenAI, wrote that AI labs should do much more to leverage the capabilities of models (address the “capability overhang”) to build personal super-assistants. When I’m using ChatGPT or Claude, the models are constrained by the features that their developers give them and we, the users, can’t do much to tweak the experience. Conversely, Clawdbot is the ultimate expression of a new generation of malleable software that is personalized and adaptive: I get to choose what Clawdbot should be capable of, and I can always inspect what’s going on behind the scenes and, if I don’t like it, ask for changes. Being able to make my computer do things – anything – by just talking to an agent running inside it is incredibly fun, addictive, and educational: I’ve learned more about SSH, cron, web APIs, and Tailscale in the past week than I ever did in almost two decades of tinkering with computers.

Clawdbot also serves as a shining example of what happens when you give modern agents (with the right harness) access to a computer: they can just build things and become smarter for specific users (but not more intelligent in general) via quasi-recursive improvement. It’s no wonder that all AI companies have noticed, and every major feature launch these days is about a virtual filesystem sandbox or CLI access.

As I argued on AppStories, I believe that the repercussions of all this will soon ripple through the various app stores, and we’ll need to have serious conversations about the role of app developers going forward. Clawdbot is a boutique, nerdy project right now, but consider it as an underlying trend going forward: when the major consumer LLMs become smart and intuitive enough to adapt to you on-demand for any given functionality – when you’ll eventually be able to ask Claude or ChatGPT to do or create anything on your computer with no Terminal UI – what will become of “apps” created by professional developers? I especially worry about standalone utility apps: if Clawdbot can create a virtual remote for my LG television (something I did) or give me a personalized report with voice every morning (another cron job I set up) that work exactly the way I want, why should I even bother going to the App Store to look for pre-built solutions made by someone else? What happens to Shortcuts when any “automation” I may want to carefully create is actually just a text message to a digital assistant away?

I don’t know the answers to these questions right now, but we’re going to try and unpack all of them on AppStories and MacStories this year.

        <hr/>
        Thrift shopping can be overwhelming for many—with so many different items to sift through, it can be difficult to determine which are actually worth bringing home and which are better being left on store shelves. We spoke with an array of secondhand shopping experts based throughout the South to learn about eight types of valuable items that you should never leave behind when thrifting. We’re also sharing three helpful tips to keep in mind while shopping, too, so that you don’t bring home items unless they’re truly worthwhile.

Items Not To Pass Up

Silver

Silver—or silverplate—items are always worth browsing for at the thrift store, says Ellie Christopher. The Birmingham-based founder of Ellie Christopher Interior Design notes that many pieces will have markings on the bottom identifying their origin. “This is when relationships with knowledgeable dealers come in handy,” she adds. “Ask questions and most will be happy to tell you about the maker and history.”

Well Made Chairs

Chairs with good quality bones are always worth bringing home, Christopher notes. “I love Beidermier pieces, which are made of cherry, ash, and oak, and they normally have a restrained geometric style and lighter color finish,” she says. “Many pieces have burled wood or bookmatched veneer on them.” Note that you can reupholster chairs as needed down the line.

Items Made of Quality Materials

Stephanie Wells recommends not getting distracted by looking for a particular type of item while thrifting but instead keeping your eyes open to a number of quality materials. Some of her favorites to look out for include brass, marble, onyx, and alabaster, just to name a few. “When you open your horizons to a general material, you will stumble across a lot more,” says the founder of The Bonny & Blithe Collection, who is based in Baltimore, Maryland. “You may even end up striking gold.”

Original Art

Hailey Covington, the Seabrook, Texas-based founder of Gulf Coast Grandmillennial, advises not passing on original artwork at the thrift store. “Unlike mass-produced prints, original pieces add a personal touch to a home, making it truly one-of-a-kind,” she says. “When identifying valuable items, I look for quality craftsmanship, materials, and unique designs that stand out.” You won’t have to worry about regretting such a purchase, either. Adds Covington, “These are the pieces that not only hold their value but also bring a distinct character to any home.”

Searching for a number or signature is another way to determine whether an art piece is an original, and the material it’s made of may provide some indication, too, explains Emi Deilus, the Fort Mill, South Carolina-based co-founder of Lainey James Collective. “Canvas and linen paper hold value and are a sign of original work versus poster board, for example,” she says. That said, “Artwork is also very subjective and if I find the beauty in it that is sometimes all the value I need,” Deilus adds.

Books

Deilus has found that many of her customers like to style vintage books on shelves or coffee tables and will keep her eyes peeled for interesting titles while thrifting. “Wording that shows that it is a first edition or finding a signed copy by the author can be especially valuable,” she says. “I am always hunting for books that have unique bindings, special materials used, or very ornate covers.”

China

Brands including Wedgwood, Limoges, Herend, Waterford, Meissen, and Fenton are all known for being top quality and are popular among collectors, Deilus says. That said, brand name isn’t everything. She adds, “Right now plate walls are a very popular home decor trend, so we find value in plates that are colorful, ornate, and just plain pretty.”

Timeless Pieces

If you spot a timeless piece of decor at the thrift store, you certainly won’t want to leave it behind. Covington will happily take home blue and white ceramics as well as brass items. “They have a warm, vintage appeal and can easily be polished up to look stunning,” she says.

Items That Bring You Joy

Regardless of an item’s actual monetary value, it’s worth bringing home if it is something you’re truly excited about, says Allison Bannister, the Salem, Virginia-based founder of Antiques with Allison. “Thrifting is always fun, but remember, if an item sparks joy for you, it’s already special and valuable regardless of the price tag,” she says.

Wells shares similar thoughts. “It’s so fun to strike gold at a thrift store, but by far the most important thing to ask yourself is if the piece is something you genuinely enjoy and makes your home feel more welcoming to you,” she says. “You also never know what will end up being a ‘treasure’ in years to come.”

Tips To Keep in Mind While Shopping:

Look for Maker’s Marks

While at the thrift store, don’t hesitate to turn an item over to inspect it further. You may just learn quite a bit! Stamps or maker’s marks are often located on the underside of items. “Not only do they typically indicate a more valuable/notable find, but they are often great indicators of age,” says Nicole Gard, the owner of Atlas + Forage Vintage in Owensboro, Kentucky. “You never know when you’ll come across a unique antique from the mid-1800s or that limited edition stamp from the 1940s.”

Make Use of Google Image Search

Reverse Google image searches can prove to be extremely helpful while you’re out thrifting, too. “You can learn pretty quickly if you’ve stumbled upon something special, just be careful as there can be copycats of items,” Wells says. “The details matter!” That said, don’t assume that the pricing that pops up on Google is going to 100 percent accurately describe an item’s value. As Kristyn McCray, the co-founder of Lainey James Collective says, “You may find items on auction sites valued in the hundreds, but have these items actually sold at that price? Pricing in a lot of instances is subjective to the seller and current buyer market.”

Don’t Buy Something Solely for Its Value

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Adrian Crook, a Vancouver father, faced an investigation by British Columbia's Ministry of Children and Family Development after allowing his four children, aged six to ten, to commute to school independently via public transit. The case highlights the conflict between 'free-range parenting' philosophies—which emphasize child empowerment and statistical safety—and government regulations that mandate adult supervision for children under the age of ten.

        <hr/>
        ADRIAN CROOK, a father of five from Vancouver, has always known what danger looks like: it’s a boxy stamped-metal contraption, with four wheels, a transmission, and a hood. When Crook was a teenager in the ’90s, his high school friend Sheri was killed in a car crash. She was coming back from a party with three friends when the driver lost his bearings and wrapped the vehicle around a pole. Over a decade later, in 2006, Crook’s grandmother was walking home from a shopping mall in Burnaby, British Columbia, when a truck ran her over at a crosswalk. She went into a coma and died in hospital.

Crook’s first son was born two months after that accident. From that moment, Crook carried the certainty that if the boy met an early death, it would almost certainly involve a car. This was a simple matter of statistical probability. In Canada, vehicular accidents are, by far, the leading killer of children and teens.

Crook and his wife had four more kids, before separating in 2013. She found a house in North Vancouver, and Crook, who hated suburbia, rented a three-bedroom condo across the inlet in downtown Vancouver. As a freelance video-game designer, he made his own hours and, in his spare time, threw himself into projects for his children. He commissioned a custom dining table large enough to seat all five kids plus their friends, and he converted his condo storage room into an art space. Often, he’d dress his kids in matching pinnies so he could see them easily, then take them out for a downtown adventure—a play session at a jungle gym, a walk by False Creek, or, on special occasions, a trip to a local diner, which served deep fried Mars bars.

Crook owned a car but avoided driving: he views it as expensive, dirty, and dangerous. To get around, he and his children relied on transit, which worked fine for summers and weekends. The problem was weekdays, when his four oldest kids went to school near their mother’s home. For the first two years, he drove them. Then he stopped—unwilling to keep relying on a car—and began riding with them on the bus, a forty-five-minute haul across two routes. Crook made the trip morning and afternoon. “It took a three-hour bite out of my day,” he says.

To him, accompanying his children seemed pointless. The kids, by then aged six to ten, were consummate transit users. They were on a first-name basis with the bus drivers and knew the routes so well they could do them blindfolded. Plus, they travelled in a pack, with cellphones that tracked their movements. Did Crook really need to be there?

In early 2017, he decided to opt out. He gave his kids lessons on transit safety and did a few trial runs, with him sitting at the back of the bus, silently observing them. Then he let them do the trip on their own. They returned from school triumphant. Crook was elated too. “Kids feel empowered when they get to navigate the world,” he says. At last, he had his workdays back.

His victory was short lived. In the spring of 2017, Crook got a call from a social worker with BC’s Ministry of Children and Family Development. Somebody had spotted his kids on the bus and notified the department, triggering an investigation. The ministry’s view was that children under ten should be watched by someone at least twelve years old. In late April, Crook sat down in his living room with a government-appointed social worker, who assailed him with questions: Why wasn’t he with his kids? Couldn’t he drive them to school? Did he really think a seven-year-old was safe riding the bus without an adult?

The social worker visited the kids at school and interviewed each of them. She and a colleague also continued to speak with Crook. He says he asked them for specifics about the supposed dangers his children faced. Their answers struck him as either preposterous (Was it even possible, he wondered, for a kidnapper to whisk one of his kids away without the others raising a hue and cry?) or banal (If a bus was delayed and his children were forced to wait at a street corner, so what?).

To defend himself, Crook appealed to data. He cited a 2013 study that analyzed crash risks according to mode of travel and showed, overwhelmingly, that bus passengers are the safest travellers on the road. (More recent research has bolstered this conclusion, including a 2018 study that examined the ten Montreal bus routes with the greatest number of injuries and found that the risk of injury for car occupants was nearly four times higher than for bus passengers). Riding a bus, in other words, is far safer than travelling by car. The ministry, Crook argued, was asking him to increase his children’s risk exposure. And they were doing it in the name of safety.

The conversations, he says, went nowhere. When Crook spoke statistics, the social workers spoke vibes. Didn’t he just know his kids were too young to be left alone? In desperation, Crook asked the query that weighed heaviest on his mind: Had he done anything illegal? A social worker explained that questions of legality weren’t the only issues at stake. The ministry was enforcing a guideline, not an actual law—but in practice, that distinction seemed to make little difference. To Crook, the message was clear: We don’t necessarily think you’re a criminal. But we still might think you’re a lousy dad.

WHEN I BECAME a parent, over three years ago, I found myself asking questions similar to the ones Crook wrestled with—about danger and reward, independence and safety. What risks, I asked, would I let my daughter take? What parenting norms would I break? And what would other people think of me?

As an elementary school kid in the ’90s, I lived much of my life away from the gaze of hovering parents. My best friend and I would walk to and from school together. On weekends, we’d bike around our suburban Toronto neighbourhood. We’d search for abandoned properties to explore or bring shovels to the nearby ravine to dig for God knows what—buried treasure, I guess, or bodies. In my friend’s basement, we’d grind charcoal, then mix it with sulphur and potassium nitrate to make gunpowder, which we’d stuff into homemade fireworks. Our world felt rich and mysterious. We saw ourselves as swashbuckling adventurers, not the prepubescent rugrats we so clearly were.

As the world has come to seem scarier, the tech industry has found ingenious ways to draw kids indoors, and offline spaces have emptied.

The culture has changed, and our perception of danger has too, because we know so much more about it. Schoolyard bullying, we now see, can do real emotional damage—much as concussions, which we once brushed off as minor, can have lasting neurological effects. We no longer see kids on milk cartons, but we get loud, piercing Amber alerts by phone, reminding us, at any hour, that another child is missing. As the world has come to seem scarier, the tech industry has found ingenious ways to draw kids indoors: iPad games that are micro-targeted to every age level, YouTube channels with unlimited slop. And so the offline spaces where kids once congregated have emptied out.

In her new book, 10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World, Jean M. Twenge—a leading US psychologist studying generational change—catalogues the differences between childhood today versus childhood four decades ago. “While 10-year-olds once had the free range of their neighborhoods, many kids these days are not allowed to go anywhere by themselves,” she writes. She later adds, “While 13 was once considered old enough to be a babysitter, many now think 13-year-olds need a babysitter.”

Twenge’s description resonates. In the residential Ottawa neighbourhood where I now live, I rarely see kids playing pick-up sports or roaming the streets in packs. The adventure playgrounds of the ’70s—with their hammers, nails, and planks of wood—have been replaced by prefabricated climbing structures with catalogue-ordered parts. In Ottawa, these contraptions have notices on them telling parents to supervise their children’s play. The parents obey, following a foot behind their kids and issuing instructions in that cloying voice adults use for babies and animals.

Is any of this healthy? When my daughter was born, I promised myself I’d do things differently. Together, she and I constantly search out new spaces to explore—ravines, splash pads, brew pubs with big outdoor patios. I let her wander as far as she wants to, so long as she doesn’t go near roads or escape my peripheral vision.

Frequently, my daughter and I travel to Toronto by train. I refuse to anesthetize her with a screen for the entire ride. Instead, she runs up and down the aisles, climbs into the baggage compartments, and has imaginary tea parties with her stuffed animals on the vacant seats. On winter days in Ottawa, we go to the National Arts Centre, which often leaves its lobby and mezzanine open to the public. One time, we broke into the empty theatre, likely because custodial staff had neglected to lock the door. I watched my daughter roam the hall, her journey illuminated by a ghost light on the proscenium stage.

My hands-off approach to parenting gets mixed reactions from other parents. Some praise me. Some are fascinated by my toddler, who strides through public spaces, arms swinging confidently. Others are appalled. In the fall of 2024, my daughter fell from a climbing structure. I was reading on a nearby bench and didn’t realize that the crying I heard was coming from her. After about thirty seconds, I looked up, saw what had happened, and came running. My daughter calmed down in my arms, but another parent at the park was furious with me.

She told me to take my daughter to the ER and request a cognitive assessment for brain injury. I ventured that the accident had been minor, since the ledge from which my daughter had tumbled was a mere foot and a half above the ground. The woman said that I was in no position to judge the fall since I hadn’t actually seen it. “We have different parenting styles,” I offered, trying to defuse her anger. “This isn’t about parenting styles,” she shot back. “This is about neglect.”

Like many journalists, I have a thick skin, but this stranger’s words destroyed me. For a week, I walked around in a funk, wondering if she’d seen something in me that I’d failed to see in myself. In the future, when I ran into her at the park, I stood close to my daughter, performing attentiveness. I feared another blow-up or a call from child services.

A year has passed since then, and I can now more clearly see the obstacles to my preferred style of parenting. Even peers who agree with me are hesitant to do things my way, because they dread the social and emotional costs. If you’re a “free-range” parent—someone who gives their kids room for independence and autonomy—you’re going to get chastised by random busybodies. When that happens, a voice inside you will ask, What if the busybodies are right? Danger, after all, is real. And on the other side of danger? Unimaginable loss. Who on Earth wants that?

IF I COULD DETACH from emotions and focus on data, I’d probably feel less internally conflicted about my approach to parenting. As I understand it, the science has my back. Today, across the world, researchers in education, pediatric health, and developmental psychology are making the strongest case yet for childhood independence and risk. Some entered the field in the 1990s and 2000s, when safety culture was coming into vogue and their ideas were pushed to the margins. They are now part of the establishment: the agenda setters, the influential thinkers, the voices shaping their fields. They’re trying to shift norms in the larger world too.

Research reveals that children allowed to wander alone play longer, burn more energy, and build richer social lives.

Why might safety culture harm young people? One answer is that it suppresses spontaneity. Chaperoned kids are less likely to do things they probably should be doing. Research from University College London reveals that children allowed to wander alone play longer, burn more energy, and build richer social lives than “sedentary, house-bound peers.” Researchers at the University of Bristol found that ten- and eleven-year-olds trusted with wider roaming rights were vastly more active, especially on school days, than those kept close to home—shrinking freedom, it seems, helps explain shrinking fitness. In 2010, researchers in Sydney, Australia, outfitted the playgrounds at twelve local schools with car tires, milk crates, and weighted boxes. These objects created mild dangers—they could be dropped, thrown, or stacked into rickety climbing structures—but they also got students moving: physical activity levels increased by 12 percent.

The benefits of free play go beyond friendship and exercise. One might view childhood as a kind of rehearsal for adulthood. By this reasoning, when adults intervene unnecessarily in children’s lives—supervising their play, mediating their disputes—they effectively call the rehearsal off, increasing the odds that things will go poorly later on.

Even the school playground may be a site where adult life skills are formed. In a forthcoming study, Mariana Brussoni, a health scientist at the University of British Columbia, found that kids more prone to engage in risky scenarios—that is, thrilling and exciting forms of play, with a real chance of injury—were better at navigating a virtual-reality road-crossing game than their peers. They made faster decisions about when to cross, with fewer near accidents. Low-stakes risk taking on the playground, Brussoni theorizes, may help build up the instincts and intuitions needed to avoid serious injury throughout our lives.

Of course, childhood isn’t only about skills acquisition. It’s about developing cognitive capacity and mental resilience too. This is where the benefits of independent play may be most powerfully felt. It’s a near consensus among researchers that, when young people are given space to manage conflicts independently, they build up an arsenal of cognitive aptitudes—empathy, tolerance, self-reliance.

Relatedly, a study out of the University of Colorado Boulder and the University of Denver shows that children who engage in unstructured activities tend to have better executive functioning—a suite of cognitive skills that includes planning, self-control, and flexibility—relative to children whose time is regimented and monitored. Good executive functioning, moreover, contributes positively to a variety of life outcomes, from higher earning potential to greater longevity.

Some of the most promising new research is in the area of childhood independence and mental health. In the mid-2010s, Helen Dodd, a child psychologist at the University of Exeter, was watching her own children play when she had a novel thought: Isn’t play basically a form of exposure therapy? For around two decades, Dodd has helped young people with extreme anxiety. Treatment often involves some form of therapy whereby the patient goes out and does the very thing they’re afraid of doing. A young person with social phobia, for instance, might go to a party or strike up a conversation with a stranger. The logic is simple: you conquer fears by facing them.

Dodd realized that a rich play environment—at least when it’s not overregulated by hovering adults—is a terrain of risk: failure, injury, social rejection. Perhaps we seek out risky play as kids because it familiarizes us with uncertainty and also with our capacity for adaptation. “If parents just got out of the way during playtime,” Dodd reasoned, “children might learn to handle anxiety on their own.”

She has since reoriented her research to focus on this theory. She surveys parents of children aged two to eleven—and, where age appropriate, the children too. Drawing on established research protocols, she asks questions like: How many tantrums does your kid have per week? How long are the tantrums? Does your child have prolonged periods of extreme isolation or withdrawal? Are they anxious about doing things that other children consider fun? The results suggest that young people who engage in risky play are less likely to exhibit signs of anxiety or depression. Dodd is now working on a randomized control trial, in which four schools will embrace risky play and four will not. “Resilience,” she theorizes, “is a muscle to be trained.”

This line of thinking requires us all to reframe our understanding of childhood risk—to see it as both a hazard and an opportunity. When she was coming up in the ’90s, Brussoni, the UBC professor, found herself out of step with her peers. The field of pediatric public health came to be dominated by epidemiologists who noted that the primary cause of childhood injury was falls from playground equipment. The trend was reinforced by ER physicians who were routinely treating children with serious injuries. When you’ve witnessed trauma like that, you naturally want to eradicate it from the world. Still, Brussoni thought that this goal was untenable—and harmful too.

She favours a more evidence-based, expansive understanding of risk. Car accidents, suicides, and opioid use are among the leading causes of death for kids. But other hazards take up more room in our imaginations. Pregnancies, violence, criminal delinquency—these phenomena are vastly less prevalent among teens and tweens than they were a generation ago, perhaps because of lower levels of lead poisoning and its behavioural effects, decreasing rates of child sexual abuse, and the widespread availability of contraception.

In BC, where Brussoni lives, only 241 of the province’s roughly 700,000 children, on average, were hospitalized annually for playground injuries between 2002 and 2023. The vast majority of these injuries were broken bones. In the twenty-first century so far, says Brussoni, the available data suggests only two children across the country have died from such accidents. Stranger abduction, meanwhile, is so rare its probability is estimated at one in 14 million. In cases of abduction, the culprit is almost always a person the child already knows. And those Amber alerts on our phones? The vast majority of missing children reports are the result of young people running away.

Is it heartless to say that the rates of playground deaths and street abductions are already as low as we might reasonably want them to be? It’s probably also true. “I’m a population-health researcher, so I look at the big picture,” says Brussoni. “I’m not looking at any one kid with exceptionally tragic circumstances, although I have great sympathy for that kid and their parents.” An anomalous tragedy is just that—a tragedy. And an anomaly. Sound health policy isn’t based in random statistical outliers. Neither is sound parenting.

IT’S ONE THING to agree with this argument; it’s another to live by it. People adjusting to the idea of free-range parenting can struggle, as I do, with fear and self-doubt. To get over it, they seek new ways of thinking.

Heidi Bergstrom, an accountant and parent of three in Camrose, Alberta, became a proponent of risky play after her husband, Gregory Doll, a phys-ed teacher, attended a conference session on the subject. Bergstrom is risk averse by nature, but she keeps her protective instincts in check. In summer, she and Doll allow their two oldest, aged eight and six, to explore a nearby walking path independently while staying within a one-kilometre radius. The kids are well versed in road safety and travel with walkie-talkies, which sometimes go out of range.

Bergstrom doesn’t know exactly what they get up to on their rambles, but she says that they always return energized and elated. “Of course, the whole thing makes me nervous,” she admits. “But I remind myself that, by letting them have autonomy now, I’m protecting their future selves.”

In moments when parental anxiety threatens to overwhelm her, Bergstrom thinks back to her most joyous childhood memories—the afternoons spent jumping into haybales, wading in ponds, or setting off down a slough on makeshift rafts assembled from junk. “I was happiest,” she says, “when I was outside with friends, without adults around. My children need to make similar memories.”

Lauren Jane Heller, an executive coach and mother of two, had, in some ways, a less idyllic childhood than Bergstrom’s. She was born in South Africa, where she spent part of her formative childhood years, along with extended stints in Toronto. In Cape Town, where she and her family lived in the ’90s, muggings at gunpoint were rampant. The homicide rate was higher than in most other places on Earth. Heller’s grandmother was murdered in a violent home invasion.

When Heller was fourteen, her family returned to Canada, and she was struck by the similarities and differences between her two homes. Montreal, where Heller eventually settled, was a thousand times safer than Cape Town, yet people still talked as if danger lurked around every corner. If a child was abducted and killed anywhere in the country, the incident would dominate the news cycle for months. “I remember thinking, Isn’t it amazing that Canadians can afford to freak out about one kid?” says Heller.

As a new mother in the early 2010s, Heller lived with her husband in Pointe-Saint-Charles, a gentrifying neighbourhood southwest of downtown Montreal. She tried to conform to the vigilant parenting norms of her Canadian community, but these practices frustrated her. “I remember sitting in the park watching my kids play,” she says. “I kept thinking, This is so dumb. Why do I have to be here?”

In 2015, the family moved to a new home one block from the old one. Across the street was a couple with four kids and a parenting ethos similar to Heller’s. Soon, her kids, aged six and three, were roaming the neighbourhood with the children from across the road, aged eleven, nine, seven, and five. “The older two girls were sweet and helpful, and they loved my kids,” says Heller. “I trusted them. We live in a densely populated community. If anything went wrong, they’d find an adult to help out.”

Today, Heller’s children, both teenagers, take the metro to school—and to hang with friends, who live all over the city. “They’ve been asked for drugs,” says Heller. “They know what used condoms look like. But they’ve surely seen worse things on TV.”

If there’s anything unusual about her children’s upbringing, she argues, it’s the degree of security they enjoy. “One of my kids is trans, and the other is thirteen but dresses like a twenty-year-old punk rocker,” says Heller. “And yet they feel secure. Isn’t this evidence that we’re succeeding as a society?” Heller believes that safety, like all forms of privilege, goes unacknowledged and unappreciated by those who possess it.

That doesn’t mean she never worries. Every free-range parent I spoke to for this piece told me—albeit not in so many words—that they manage their safety concerns by invoking that old adage about changing the things you can’t accept and accepting the things you can’t change. Risk is an essential part of life, they reason, but you can still distinguish between necessary and excessive kinds.

Jeni Marinucci, a writer and editor from Milton, Ontario, remembers when her youngest child first discovered the power of fire. The family was on a camping trip when, one morning, she felt warmth at her back. She turned around to see her four-year-old son standing over a fire and smiling with Promethean glee. With a stick, he’d dug up glowing embers from the evening before, then stoked them with leaves and twigs.

How should she respond? One option was to scold her son, then vow to keep a closer eye on him going forward. But an interest in fire, she reasoned, is linked to a broader sense of curiosity about the world. Isn’t that a virtue? “We need fire when camping,” she told her son. “Do you want to be the fire chief? If so, you also need to be the fire safety chief.”

The distinction between risk and recklessness is sacred. But there’s no fail-safe way to ensure you’re on the right side of that line.

She bought him protective gloves, goggles, tongs—even, eventually, a Zippo lighter—and taught him everything she knew about fire management. In an era when young men are disappearing into bedrooms and internet forums, her son remains fascinated by the tactile, physical environment. When he was eleven, he built a homemade kiln to fire clay he’d dug up in the backyard. Now, he’s twenty-one and a trained blacksmith, volunteering at a real-life smithy run by a local historical society.

For Marinucci and other free-range parents, the distinction between risk and recklessness is sacred. You embrace the former and avoid the latter. But as everyone knows, there’s no fail-safe way to ensure you’re always on the right side of that line. And so you trust your instincts and make peace with an uncomfortable fact: things can go horribly wrong, even if they likely won’t.

Nathan Whitlock, a parent of three in Hamilton, Ontario (and a contributor to The Walrus), remembers the time he climbed a waterfall on the Niagara Escarpment with his preteen daughter. For half an hour, they scrambled along mossy rocks, grabbing hands for stability, until, suddenly, they were looking out at the world from forty feet up. The memory is one of Whitlock’s favourites. But the adventure didn’t have to turn out so well. “I remember thinking, What if she slips and falls?” Whitlock says. “This is either the best parenting decision of my life or the worst one.”

My Job as a Parent Is to Make My Kids’ Lives a Little Harder

How Do You Know When Your Kids Have Outgrown You?

Why We Need Car-Free School Streets

THE WORK OF PARENTING, as I understand it, is not to shield kids from risk but rather to help them navigate a world of countervailing risks. The dangers of free play—injuries, bullying, peer pressure, substance abuse, the possibility of getting lost or mugged while roaming the neighbourhood—are real. But they’re offset by other dangers: depression, anxiety, isolation, the negative cardiovascular effects of a sedentary lifestyle, and the developmental costs that come from a lack of familiarity with danger. Parenthood is an unwinnable game. We’ll be better at it if we accept this fact.

I wish our culture did more to support free-range parents. Recently, we’ve taken modest steps in that direction. In early 2024, the Canadian Paediatric Society set out its position on risky play, which encouraged “thrilling and exciting forms of free play that involve uncertainty of outcome and a possibility of physical injury.” Newly opened playgrounds, from Vancouver’s Charleson Park, with its pirate ship decked out in climbing nets, to Toronto’s Biidaasige, with its ziplines and water pumps, hark back to the ’70s, the golden era of children’s play. We need more of that.

In 2018, the state of Utah passed North America’s first free-range parenting law. The bill clarifies that child protection agents cannot investigate parents merely for allowing kids to walk, play, or wait in a car unsupervised. As of summer 2025, ten other states have passed similar bills. In Canada, we could do the same. At the very least, we could put more government resources into making Stay Safe—a safety-training program devised by the Canadian Red Cross and targeted to kids—widely available. In doing so, we’d shift the burden of child safety, ever so slightly, from adults to children, who are capable of doing some of this work themselves.

Ultimately, though, a change in parenting practices must come from parents. This means reckoning with the psychological barriers that prevent us from giving our children the space they need to play and grow—barriers that are, perhaps, more complicated than I originally thought they were. Yes, a fear of abduction or injury is holding parents back, but so too is another, more deep-seated, anxiety.

Last September, I was at the National Arts Centre again with my daughter, when I realized I had to pee. “Come to the bathroom,” I told her. She responded, as usual, with an authoritative no. “You go peepee,” she told me. “I stay here.” I didn’t feel like fighting. So I left her for two minutes, believing that she’d be fine.

When we follow kids at the playground and accompany them at job interviews, we shore up our centrality in their lives. We do it for us, not them.

The next morning, I nevertheless felt weird about my decision, not because things had gone badly but rather because they’d gone well: my daughter had enjoyed two minutes of complete autonomy in the middle of a bustling city. It was a victory that presaged greater victories to come—and greater losses too. Someday, she’d be able to spend hours or even days on her own. Those two minutes of freedom were the beginning of a gradual process of separation, exhilarating for her, devastating for me.

Helicopter parenting isn’t only about risk aversion. When we overprotect our kids—when we follow them at the playground, chaperone them on social outings, and accompany them at job interviews—we shore up our centrality to their lives. This tendency may feel benevolent, but it’s probably damaging. And let’s not lie to ourselves: we do it for us, not them.

After a nearly two-month investigation, the Ministry of Children and Family Development found that Crook’s children were unsafe on transit, noting, as well, that Crook’s ex-wife did not approve of his kids travelling to school on their own. (Unlike Crook, I’ve been lucky, as a free-range parent, to have the complete support of my co-parent and extended family.) The ministry set new rules for Crook: he was now forbidden from letting his younger kids out of sight for any amount of time until they turned ten. To comply with the order, Crook mostly kept his children indoors. He resumed the daily commutes to and from school.

He also petitioned the ministry to review the order. They left it in place, as eventually did the Supreme Court of British Columbia. It would take three years—and roughly $70,000 in legal fees, most of it crowdfunded—for Crook to finally have the decision reversed. That happened in 2020, when the Court of Appeal for British Columbia determined that the ministry had overstepped its mandate.

In a sense, Crook had beaten the charge of being a lousy dad. But what was his reward? The same painful outcome that parents who raise healthy, independent kids all eventually face. Crook’s oldest son recently left the Army Cadets, which had him living on bases across the country, and is starting post-secondary studies. His oldest daughter is studying media at university. His middle and youngest children, both boys, are gym rats and rugby players; they live with their mother, close to school. Crook’s youngest daughter, a budding athlete

and student council rep, still lives with him, but her calendar is jammed with social and extracurricular activities.

In short, everything worked out fine. In a world in which many kids are homebound, lonely, and struggling to launch, Crook has helped raise five confident children with rich, autonomous lives. The upshot, for him, is a rapidly emptying nest. His children call when they can, but they have other priorities on their minds and other relationships to manage. “I sometimes get sad,” says Crook. “But parenting is about making your kids not need you.”

        ‘InnSæi’, pronounced ‘in-sy-ay’, is an Icelandic concept that refers to the magnificent, complex, largely incomprehensible but fascinating world that exists within all of us. InnSæi merges two words: Inn, translated as ‘inside’ or ‘into’, and Sæi, derived from the verb ‘to see’ but also evoking sær, the word for ‘sea’. I love the alchemy of words and the way they can help us make sense of things. InnSæi poetically captures the nature of intuition and provides a framework for cultivating it. In this Guide I will show you how.

InnSæi has three meanings: the sea within; to see within; and to see from the inside out. The ‘sea within’ refers to the flow of your unconscious mind: a world of imagination, vision, sensing and emerging that works much faster than the relatively slow, focused mind. To ‘see within’ refers to self-awareness and metacognition: the ability to see inside yourself, to discern intuition from your biases, fears and wishful thinking, and to know when you can rely on intuition and when not. Finally, to ‘see from the inside out’ implies a strong inner compass, which enables you to navigate and create your own path in the ever-changing ocean of life.

In a world characterised by uncertainty, opportunities, speed and ceaseless attempts to numb our senses and hijack our attention, developing your InnSæi will give you clarity, focus and resilience.

I know this all too well myself.

The only way out was in

In my late 20s, I hit a wall, lost direction in life, and descended into darkness. A series of crises brought me to my knees and forced me to connect within, to my intuition, as I had nowhere else to go.

It started when I embarked on my dream career at the dawn of the 21st century, working for the United Nations in war-torn Kosovo, where I managed a small UN agency. Coming to Kosovo after the war was like walking into an open wound. I was determined to give it all I had, knowing that the people who’d suffered war were my priority, and thinking that my wellbeing was not.

You probably know the feeling I had at the time – that sense of overwhelm when faced with an urgent task, thinking that it will be OK, if only you work harder, try better.

In early 2002, I was travelling for work from Kosovo to Kazakhstan when I felt a terrible pain and started to bleed. I didn’t think much of it, took painkillers and went on with work. It was only a couple of years later that I realised I’d had a miscarriage. Instead of this being my wake-up call, I’d just kept ploughing on, deepening my disconnection from my emotions and body.

Soon after, I was in the unique position of having a guaranteed job at the UN for life. But the heavy bureaucracy and hierarchy at the UN in Geneva, Switzerland felt all-consuming. There, I felt my sense of drive and purpose get weaker, and I felt out of touch with the living world. It was as if we were serving a system instead of serving people and the planet.

Not long afterwards, I also started to go through difficulties in my personal life. The accumulated effect began to take its toll on my physical health. But then, in the middle of a turbulent, sleepless period, I experienced a precious moment of clarity, close by the sea near our home in Iceland. I realised deep down that I wanted a different life. I decided to leave my job at the UN: what followed was a period of uncertainty, healing, rehabilitation and finding my InnSæi.

My story about losing hope in life, about my body caving in, to alert me to my disconnection from within, is by no means unique. Many people all over the world have had similar experiences. Perhaps you have too?

Learning how to align with InnSæi and its rhythms meant that the world inside and around me started to move and flow. I had begun the process of healing. Let me share with you four ways that helped me do it.

Key points

InnSæi is an Icelandic concept that poetically captures the nature of intuition and how to cultivate it. InnSæi has three meanings: ‘the sea within’ (your unconscious); ‘to see within’ (self-awareness); and ‘to see from the inside out’ (a strong inner compass). You can find your InnSæi by following four exercises.

Connect with your gut. Mind-body connection is necessary to be able to align with and hone your intuition through InnSæi. To practise, take some deep breaths, try asking yourself questions and see how your stomach reacts to them.

Use journaling for mental clarity. Keep a daily journal each day for 5-15 minutes. Don’t analyse or judge your thoughts. Simply allow them to flow onto the piece of paper. Make sure you also tune in to your body as you write.

Keep an attention journal. Carry your daily journal with you wherever you go and make a note of anything that captures your attention. Paying attention to your attention provides information about what you’re allowing into your system – what’s informing and shaping you, mostly unconsciously.

Cultivate a state of flow. Choose a meaningful, challenging task that you really want to achieve, set aside 60 minutes of private time to focus on it (consider playing instrumental music in the background) and then let your ideas flow. Reflect afterwards on whether you manged to become fully immersed and lost track of time (a sign of flow). What would you do differently next time?

Connect with your gut (the sea within)

Mind-body connection is necessary to be able to align with and hone your intuition through InnSæi. Reading your body’s signals (eg, your ‘gut feelings’) will help you tap into unconscious information: the sea within.

When something feels off, we talk about getting chills down our spine or a gut reaction. That’s your cue to ask: what is my unconscious trying to tell me? Learning how to read your body signals is a matter of constant practice – you are the only one who can become an expert at it.

Take the example of a knot in the stomach. It could have different meanings. It might signify an urge to do something you’ve been postponing, avoiding or are ready to do. Alternatively, a knot in the stomach may be telling you that you are about to do something that goes against your values. Honing your InnSæi will help you tell the difference.

Learn to interpret your body’s signals

Here’s an exercise to help you practise interpreting your gut’s signals. It’s especially good if you are worried, stressed or anxious:

Take a few deep breaths and observe how your breathing moves your stomach. Listen to what your stomach is telling you it needs. Does it want extra-deep breaths? Or does it want a full stretch – extending your feet and spine while expanding your belly?

Ask yourself questions and see how your stomach reacts to them, does it feel calm or anxious? Your questions could be: How are you doing [insert your own name]? Is [insert a decision you’re contemplating] the right choice for me at this point? Am I afraid of [insert a decision or outcome relevant to your situation]?

Next, lie on your back and take two or three deep breaths to settle into the position.

Breathe in deeply, keep the air in and, on the count of four, breathe out until there’s no more to exhale. Now suck in your stomach two or three times in a rhythmic movement, holding in your breath on the last inhale. When you can’t hold your breath any longer, let it all out before filling your lungs with air once again.

Repeat this a few times.

Now write down in your journal (more on this next) what came up for you. Expressing your thoughts in this way, after connecting with your body, will help you process and more effectively reflect on what your unconscious is trying to tell you.

Use journaling for mental clarity (to see within)

Keep a daily journal

Journaling daily, in a stream of consciousness, is a powerful way to reduce mind-chatter and witness yourself unfold. You are ‘asking’ the journal to store a lot of the thoughts that are otherwise floating around in your mind and taking up mental space. That is a goal in itself, and it will help you hone your intuition.

Write for 5-15 minutes. Allow the thoughts and words to flow from your mind. If you miss a day, continue the day after.

Don’t analyse or judge your thoughts. Simply allow them to flow onto the piece of paper. I recommend writing with a pen or a pencil: research shows it is more effective for your clarity and memory than typing.

Journaling helps you better see what type of thoughts are swirling around in your mind and to become more aware of any critical voices in your head. When you journal, it’s important to consciously decide that these voices need to leave your headspace.

Other voices will pop up, too, and it is important to recognise them in order to find your own. We all have stories in our heads, based on old beliefs and assumptions. Some of these beliefs and assumptions may come from loved ones or may even be something you think loved ones would say. When your brain predicts outcomes from old mental models, it reinforces a loop. Your mission is to make a hole in your mental model, step out of your habitual thinking and behaviour, and create space for new visions and ideas.

Journaling can help you unravel unhelpful patterns, realising things like: ‘Oh my God, I’m in a loop. How many minutes a day do I spend on this thought? Is this a recurring fear? Is it someone else’s voice in my head or a genuine gut feeling?’ Over time, you can better differentiate between intuition and other internal signals. You can become more selective about the thoughts you listen to. Make sure you also tune in to your body as you write. Note down when you feel physical reactions to your thoughts. This will build on the previous step about gut feelings and teach you to read your body’s signals.

Keep an attention journal (to see within and to see from the inside out)

Your attention is the key to intuition. You pay attention with your whole body and senses. And as we know, our attention is a scarce resource, and highly sought after in today’s world.

It is important to remain the steward of your own attention, because how you pay attention and attend to the world shapes your intuition, intelligence and the world you experience.

The guiding principle for attention journaling is a simple, yet powerful instruction:

Pay attention to what you pay attention to, and document it in your journal

Make sure you keep your journal with you wherever you go. Attention journaling collects snapshots from your senses, body and mind. (You can use the same journal as for your daily journal practice – don’t worry if the two types of journaling get mixed up.)

Any time something catches your attention, write it down in the journal (either in the moment or, if not practical, then at the earliest opportunity). Don’t judge, simply weigh and evaluate what your attention picks up.

Research shows that our hearts sometimes know before our minds do. Somatic markers like changes in heart rate, gut sensations or muscle tension is our embodied intelligence at work and it often occurs before conscious awareness. By paying attention to what grabs your attention, you will better hear what your intuition is telling you.

Let’s say you’re shopping at the food market and notice the energy of the person beside you at the till. Later, you write in your journal: ‘The energy of the person next to me was …’ You don’t even have to explain it. You just notice it. What we pay attention to brings certain things into life while others recede, but rarely do we notice what we notice. While we could never possibly notice all the information surrounding us at every moment, most of us can do a better job of paying attention to what we are picking up with our mind and bodily attention.

Paying attention to your attention provides information about what you’re allowing into your system – what’s informing and shaping you, mostly unconsciously. It is also a brilliant generator for creativity. It helps wake up sleeping systems, sparks ideas, can bring us joy, and make unexpected connections between seemingly unrelated dots.

There are also various deliberate ways to learn from your attention journaling, here is one:

Choose 10 words or phrases from one week of attention journaling

At the end of a week of writing your attention journal, flip through the pages and choose 10 words or phrases randomly, and underline or highlight them. Don’t worry that the pages mix with the daily journaling.

Now write out those 10 words or phrases in a vertical line on a fresh sheet of paper.

Give yourself time to observe this list and sense what these words tell you. Don’t rationalise them, practise observing them and keeping your mind open for them to speak to you. Here we practise one of the ways to see from the inside out. What emerges for you?

Each word and sense is there because you paid attention to it. Allow patterns, shapes, narrative or a feeling to emerge. Trust the process, let go of control, let the context come to you.

Many of us find it very hard to not control the process, but to allow this raw material to speak to us and for ideas to emerge. The more times you try it, the easier it will become and it will help you tune in to your intuition and sense-making, without being deliberate or having preconceived plans.

For instance, an engineer who studied with me in 2009 found this exercise foreign and challenging to begin with. But after doing it, she came back with a prototype of a ring, which soon became a successful jewellery brand. Some of what her attention picked up was ‘egg shell’, ‘feather’ and ‘a red thread’. She noticed she was always creating something decorative from random things she found in her environment. (Paradoxically, the things that come very naturally to us are often things we do not usually value or notice enough.) Paying attention to what she paid attention to made her realise her artistic inclination and that her way of seeing items and the environment was unique to her.

If by the end of this exercise you have come up with a valuable and interesting insight, you have experienced how intuition can work cognitively, and how intuition and analysis are mutually supportive and synergistic.

Cultivate a state of flow (see from the inside out)

This exercise helps you merge together bits and pieces of all the three dimensions of InnSæi – but especially helps you to see from the inside out. It’s about allowing your intuition to flow and work hand in hand with presence so that you can tap into your inner sense of direction, interest, knowledge, imagination and experience. Each time you perform this exercise, you are disciplining a part of your mind not to get in the way of your ‘flow mindset’. When you are in your zone, in a flow mindset, you lose track of time and self, and feel fully immersed in the act. You are aligned with your intuition and inner compass.

To start, I recommend you set an alarm for 60 minutes, so you can fully focus on the task at hand in private. I personally find it helpful to play instrumental music during the exercise, to help everything flow and release me from the grip of my often overly logical, analytical mind.

Three steps into a flow state:

Choose one task that you really want to achieve. Flow takes all your mental energy, deployed deliberately in one direction, so that’s why it’s necessary to focus on just one goal at a time. It could be writing a presentation, pitching an idea or creating a strategy for something you care about.

Think about why this task is meaningful to you – you can’t flow into a goal that you don’t care about. My work on InnSæi is deeply meaningful to me. At the start of 2025 it had become clear that my book was coming out in many languages around the world. How did I want to continue to work on InnSæi besides the book? Should I write another book? Start to teach at a university? Focus on giving talks? I felt the urge to find a clear focus for my work and my task for the next 60 minutes would be to identify what practical steps I needed to take.

It helps if the task you choose to do is at the edge of your abilities; so try taking what you like doing a step further, make it a bit more challenging. For me, I was doing something new. I had never written a strategy for InnSæi and I was intimidated by the ‘business’ side of it. I downloaded a strategic planning template I found online. I set the alarm for 60 minutes, and I started to fill the template with my vision for InnSæi until 2030. I allowed ideas to flow on the paper – the process was effortless and I enjoyed it. I didn’t stop to think what I was writing, I simply allowed what emerged to flow. I wrote with more courage than I would have had if I’d stopped myself along the way with questions like ‘You think you can do that?’ ‘How are you going to make this happen?’ ‘Shouldn’t you be walking the dog now!?’ At the end of the 60 minutes, I read what I’d written and allowed my analytical mind to make only a few tweaks.

After you’ve practised the flow exercise for a set time, reflect on your experience in your journal. What is your takeaway from practising a state of flow? Did you manage to lose track of time and place and to feel immersed in your activity? Would you have had the same outcome without being in a state of flow? Jot down how the flow state helped you align with your InnSæi and inner compass. What would you do differently next time?

Final notes

In our age of information overload, uncertainty and search for meaning, a well-honed intuition – InnSæi – is crucial to stay consciously and courageously anchored to our inner compass while constantly adjusting to new realities. Realistically, learning how to align with, tune in to and master your intuition and InnSæi takes both intention and discipline – the more often you practise the exercises in this Guide, the easier they will become. If you would like to get to know more about InnSæi and how it is practised among leaders, explorers, artists, philosophers, scientists, healers and people from the world of sports, read my book InnSæi: Heal, Revive and Reset with the Icelandic Art of Intuition (2024).

        <hr/>
        QUARTZITE, Ariz. — Rachele Adair had a problem.

The van that she lived in as a nomad had broken down. But she needed to be hundreds of miles away in a matter of days to volunteer at the Rubber Tramp Rendezvous, an annual meetup of nomads who live in their vehicles. So the retired nurse scrounged up $500, bought a truck in California, threw some clothes and a mattress in the back and drove off to the dusty Arizona desert.

She planned to sleep in the unheated vehicle at the January event.

Instead, a small group of her friends at the RTR offered her a heated trailer to stay in for a few days while they chipped in money, time and expertise to help build out her truck. Many of them did so anonymously so she couldn't know who to pay back.

"It will literally be a small cabin on the bed of my truck that goes 8 feet out and will be an amazing home. Exactly what I wanted," she said.

Adair's story is far from unique at the gathering organized by the Homes on Wheels Alliance, a nonprofit that helps those living a "mobile lifestyle."

The movement

Rather than a quirky band of drifters, the people behind the Rubber Tramp Rendezvous are each other's support systems, safety nets and security blankets. And they're organized.

Bob Wells set up the first RTR back in 2011. It was a meeting place for people who travel across the U.S. in vans, buses, cars and RVs and typically camp, untethered from a physical address.

Some of them live in their vehicles out of necessity — homelessness is the alternative. "They're looking at moving into a vehicle as a way to find shelter and to thrive rather than consider themselves homeless on the street," said Suanne Carlson, who co-founded the alliance with Wells.

Others are drawn to a lifestyle that allows them the freedom to explore North America and live minimally. Wells was hugely influential in setting a philosophy built on community support and small living.

The gatherings had two goals in mind, said Carlson: to offer a venue where people can build community, and to help people learn how to be successful in the lifestyle.

"How do you actually live on the road? … Because it's not like just porting over a house into a vehicle. It really is more like camping than it is like living in a house," she said.

The event

Hundreds of volunteers descend on a baseball field in Quartzsite, a small town near the California border, over about a week in the middle of January. They don safety vests and guide cars into parking spots, buzz around the grounds picking up trash and chirp back and forth to each other on walkie-talkies.

Thousands of people attend the event — which is free, although donations to the alliance are welcome. People can set out items they no longer need for others to take, like books, clothes and cookware. A small sewing circle gathers to mend clothes.

People write their needs and offer up skills on index cards posted on billboards. "Need tent zipper repair ideas/skills," one card reads.

There's also a raffle: Attendees can enter to win a $10,000 cash prize alongside a kitted-out ambulance designed by Bob Wells himself.

The community

It's taco Tuesday in the open air of the Arizona desert. Music blares as the sun slips below jagged mountains. A couple dozen volunteers are eating after a full day working at the RTR.

The food was made by Derrick Hansler, better known in the community as D Rock, as part of his project he calls, "Smell what D Rock is Cooking."

"I have built a little chuckwagon. And I pull it around to all kinds of nomadic gatherings and put out food, beer, for donations or whatever you have," he said.

The dinner is emblematic of the deep community ties among the nomads. Many have stories to tell like Rachele Adair's.

April Craren was on the brink of homelessness when she applied to a program run by HOWA that provided her with a van.

"They will give you the shirt off their back, even if they don't have one," said Craren. "They'll do anything for you."

When Tracey Power was involved in a serious car crash that sent her spiraling mentally, other nomads were there for her.

"Within 24 hours of the situation, I had a volunteer therapist. A week later, I had a second therapist. The community just really rallied around me, not just my little tribe, but the whole community. And it's what saved my life," said Power.

Home proud

Attention to detail is huge among the nomads. The "rigs" — the lingo for their vehicles — are as unique as their owners. They're both practical and beautiful. Some are bedecked in antiques and artwork; others are minimalist and pristine.

In Mary Feuer's teal school bus, the kitchen cabinet doors are made from 1920s fruit crates. Her bed has a wooden headboard from the '30s. Out front, a shrine is embedded into the wall next to the door.

"That's Saint Rita. She is the patron saint of improbable causes. And that's why she's the patron saint of this bus. Because this bus has had its highly improbable moments," she said.

Lori Gaskill has modified the interior of an ambulance with a rustic feel. She has wood cabinets, a custom-made tambour door that slides up to reveal her closet and live edge oak countertops.

"I wanted it to look like a log cabin, barn type of environment. I'm kind of a freak when it comes to woodworking … so everything's wood," she said.

Off the back is a flagpole where she can hoist the Stars and Stripes. Gaskill has also outfitted the ambulance to help with search and rescue efforts.

"If I've got to pull somebody over the side of a cliff or something, I can take my rear winch or my front winch and put my A-frame on it, let it hang off the back and be like a little crane," she said.

Vanessa, who runs a popular YouTube channel, chose black, orange and gold as her color scheme in her van. (She only uses her first name on her channel because of previous online harassment and asked that her last name not be used for this story.) She wiped down the glossy black floor before showing off the interior, where even the kitchen block knife set has gold handles to match the other gold accents throughout.

She's also got a four-burner stove and a deep sink so she can cook herself homemade meals.

"My kitchen is going to always be the main focal point for me because I am the oldest of six children and I've been cooking my whole life," she said.

Adair's new home on wheels is taking shape, too. The contractor who is helping with the build has put up walls with insulation and windows in her Toyota Tundra's bed. Adair calls it a "cabin on wheels."

Adair said she came to the event with a truck, but she's leaving with a home.

        Isn’t it truly fantastic, downright impossibly impressive, that the Grammys have always gotten everything exactly right? For an institution that has been around for several decades, witnessing countless trends and artists rise and fall, to always nominate and award the most deserving efforts, especially when it comes to Album of the Year, is astonishing. So, let us just say ahead of the 2026 Grammy Awards this weekend: Kudos, Recording Academy, kudos.

Sarcasm can be hard to convey via text, but we have little worry that you’ve missed our snark. The Grammys — and pretty much all award shows — are just as synonymous with snubs and bad decisions as they are with rehearsed spectacle and drunken moments of celebrity. They don’t always get it wrong, but we remember the egregious whiffs much more than we do the times they actually picked a deserving winner.

Missing on album of the year is a tradition that’s as old as the ceremony itself, so join us on a journey through the most undeserving Album of the Year wins in Grammy history. These albums aren’t necessarily bad — at worst, they tend to be safe and forgettable — but they are Album of the Year recipients that beat some of the greatest records of all time. Our list of the worst album of the year winners outright would surely look different — and, hey, maybe we’ll get to that one day!

For this exercise, we also played on the Grammys terms, pitting the category winner against only the other albums nominated that year. To consider all of the amazing records never even recognized by the Recording Academy would be a can of worms not even the proudest of early birds would be interested in opening.

So, with all of that being said, scroll on to see our picks of the 10 most undeserving Album of the Year winners in the history of the Grammys. You can also see a full list of the 2026 Grammy nominations here, and once the ceremony begins, check back here to follow along with our coverage.

Sure, Frank Sinatra's sprawling career retrospective compilation A Man and His Music was a feat of popular entertainment. It was the mid '60s and Sinatra, who re-recorded dozens of staples for the project, had already reached icon status. But the reason it's an undeserving Album of the Year pick, beyond the fact that there were only three new songs on the record, is that it beat The Beatles' Revolver at the 1967 Grammys. Sinatra had beaten The Beatles the prior year with September of My Years winning over Help!, which is probably fair — but Revolver is an undeniable step up from Help! and remains one of The Beatles' masterpieces. Clearly, the Recording Academy hadn't quite grasped the current and future impact that the Fab Four would have; denying the album with "Eleanor Rigby," "Got to Get You Into My Life," and "Tomorrow Never Knows" over a retread of sentimental Sinatra was certainly a miss. — Paolo Ragusa

There's a funny thing award shows like the Grammys or the Oscars like to do, where they seemingly attempt to right past wrongs by awarding later era work by a beloved artist (almost always not their best, mind you) solely because they now recognize said artist should have won in the past. Maybe its the cool kids of the past growing into eligible voters with a vengeance, maybe it's merely a game of name recognition, but it turns categories like Album of the Year or Best Picture into lifetime achievement awards rather than, you know, a chance to spotlight the best art of the year. Such is the case with Steely Dan, a great act with classics under their belt that won their first Album of the Year with their 2000 comeback album Two Against Nature. Ask just about anyone, and they'll tell you it's no Aja, no Can't Buy a Thrill, and certainly no Kid A, The Marshall Mathers LP, or even Midnight Vultures. Beck fans can rest easy, though, as he'll pull off a similar gambit in due time (FORESHADOWING ALERT). — J. Krueger

This is certainly one of the more puzzling choices in the pantheon of Album of the Year winners. Thirteen years out, we can comfortably say that Mumford & Sons' Babel had very little cultural impact compared to Frank Ocean's Channel Orange, which remains a genuine masterpiece and influenced an entire class of artists. Now, if it were Mumford & Sons' first album we were talking about, it'd almost be more understandable; before then, it seemed like no one in popular music dared to pick up a banjo, and that record certainly left a "stomp, clap, hey!" trail to be followed. But this is their second album, the one with "I Will Wait" (a horrible song, frankly), and it offered no substantial deviations from their established sound or any folk anthems worth screaming along to. As an artistic statement, it absolutely pales in comparison to Channel Orange, which should have taken the Album of the Year award in 2013. — P. Ragusa

        Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:

The animal kingdom contains a vast array of animals capability of remarkable regenerative abilities, but known are quite as adept at this healing task than sea-swelling Cnidarians, such as hydra, jellyfish, and sea anemones.

Scientists from the University of Vienna studied the genome of the scarlet sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis) in an attempt to undercover its immortal abilities.

According to a new study, the scientists discovered possible multipotent stem cells in the anemone for the first time, which could point to how these creatures are able to successfully fight back against the ravages of time.

Homo sapiens have remarkable regenerative abilities—wounds heal, bone fractures “thread” back together, and some organs can even regrow from devastating injury—but none of these biological bonafides compares to the healing power of the humble starlet sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis).

Located along the eastern coast of the U.S., with a few introduced populations scattered along the western U.S. coast and the southeast coast of Britain, this sea anemone is a member of the sea-dwelling phylum Cnidaria, which is well-known for its full-body regenerative abilities—so much so that some animals in this phylum, such as the jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, are functionally immortal. Because of this ability to seemingly defy the aging process, these animals have figured prominently in anti-aging research.

Now, in a study published in the journal Science Advances, researchers from the University of Vienna have possibly identified small, multi-potent cells in scarlet sea anemones that basically allow cnidarians to continually drink from the proverbial fountain of youth. In humans, stems cells allow limited regeneration of certain cells in our body (which is why they’re central to the exploration of anti-aging therapies), however, other animals display much greater, whole-body regenerative abilities compared to us humans.

Because it can reproduce asexually (though it can multiply sexually as well) and can be raised easily in laboratory conditions, N. vectensis has quickly become the go-to species for studying the immortal abilities of cnidarians more broadly (a concept known as a “model organism”). While scientists have known that the scarlet sea anemone shows little to no signs of aging, they haven’t been able to identify stem cells that drive this unending youth mainly due to their extremely small size.

University of Vienna’s Ulrich Technau, the senior author of this new study, and his team used a new method called “single cell genomics” in the hunt for these missing stem cells. The scientists were able to discern the stem cell lineage of certain cells developed based on transcriptome profiles, which are a collection of mRNA transcripts.

“By combining single-cell gene expression analyses and transgenesis,” University of Vienna’s Andreas Denner, the first author of the study, said in a press statement. “We have now been able to identify a large population of cells in the sea anemone that form differentiated cells such as nerve cells and glandular cells and are therefore candidates for multipotent stem cells.”

The team looked specifically at highly-conserved (i.e. unchanged via evolution) genes nanos and piwi, which are regulatory proteins involved in stem cell differentiation as well as gametogenesis—the process of creating germ cells and gametes (sperm and eggs). When the team mutated the nanos2 gene using CRISPR gene scissors, they discovered that this protein was necessary for forming germ cells as well as somatic cells and likely appeared in nature around 600 million years ago.

Now that scientists have enticing stem cell candidates, future studies will delve deeper into the mechanisms that make cnidarians, such as the scarlet sea anemone, adept fighters against the ravages of aging that afflict nearly every other species on the planet.

        <hr/>
        HOUSTON (AP) — Winter’s brutal grip on the U.S. East is not letting up, with coming days bringing subfreezing temperatures that will plunge deep into what had been a toasty Florida peninsula and a powerful blizzard forecast that may strike the Atlantic coast.

Deep cold is forecast to stick around at least into the first week of February. Meteorologists are also watching what could become a “ bomb cyclone ” — a quickly intensifying storm that’s a winter version of a hurricane — forming off the Carolinas Friday night into Saturday.

“A major winter storm appears to be coming to the Carolinas,” said meteorologist Peter Mullinax of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Weather Prediction Center.

That storm could dump snow — at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) with white-out conditions — in the Carolinas, northern Georgia and southern Virginia. After that, it could turn and plow through the Interstate 95 corridor late Saturday into Sunday to dump loads more snow from Washington to Boston, further paralyzing much of the country. Or it could deliver a glancing blow, mostly striking places like Cape Cod.

Alternatively, it could just veer off harmlessly to sea. Meteorologists and forecast models aren’t yet settling on a single outcome.

“The confidence is much higher that in the coastal Carolinas and Virginia that there will be significant snowfall this weekend,” said James Belanger, vice president for meteorology at the Weather Channel and its parent company. “The real question is going to be the trajectory it takes” from there.

Private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former NOAA chief scientist, said for the mid-Atlantic and north it’s a “boom or bust” situation. “If it happens (to go along the coast) it’s going to be a big-time event.”

Models still disagree on storm track

On Tuesday forecast models were all over the place, from out to sea to inward toward Philadelphia. By Wednesday morning they started to agree that “we’re likely to see some form of a powerful coastal storm somewhere east of North Carolina, off the Delmarva coast, but they still disagree as to where,” Mullinax said.

Chances of the storm veering away from the East Coast entirely had diminished Wednesday morning, but hadn’t disappeared altogether, Mullinax said.

Of all the options, “from D.C. up to New York is probably the most unclear,” Mullinax said. He said a mere 50-mile (80-kilometer) difference in the storm’s center will be critical. AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said it may be hard for the southern mid-Atlantic to avoid some kind of snow, whether a little or a lot.

This storm will blow harder than the last one

This weekend’s storm will differ from the previous storm, which started with moist air from the Pacific that combined with a deep plunge of Arctic air from an elongated polar vortex supplemented by more moisture from the south and east, meteorologists said. The last storm had little wind. This one will generate high winds, even if the snow misses the Washington area, generating gusts that could still reach 40 mph (65 kph), plunging wind chills near subzero Fahrenheit (minus 18 Celsius), Mullinax said.

“It looks like a pretty strong and explosive storm so everybody is going to have some gusty winds,” Pydynowski said, even inland places that won’t come close to getting snow like Pittsburgh. Strong winds may take daytime temperatures in the teens there down to feeling like they are below zero, he said.

“This is what we’d consider more of a classic nor’easter,” Belanger said, describing a storm forming around the U.S. Gulf Coast crossing into the Atlantic and going up that coast.

Frigid air and warm water combine to make strong storm

In this case, one key is warmer-than-normal water in the Gulf of Mexico — partly from human-caused climate change — and the always toasty Atlantic Gulf Stream, said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist for the nonprofit Climate Central.

When that happens the storm “pulls in more moisture and it gives it more strength,” she said.

Once the core of the storm nears the Carolinas its pressure will drop tremendously, enough to qualify for what meteorologists call “bombogenesis” or “a bomb cyclone,” That will give it the effect of a moderate-strength hurricane, including huge winds, but in the winter, Maue and Belanger said.

If the storm does come ashore, those winds and extra snow could cause massive snow drifts big enough to bury cars, Maue said.

Arctic chill sticks around and goes further south

What is more certain is that the Arctic chill in the Midwest and East will continue through mid-February, with only slight warmups that would still be below normal, meteorologists said.

And this new weekend storm “is going to take that cold and it’s going to spill right down the heart of the Florida peninsula,” Pydynowski said. Orlando is forecast to go well below freezing and only have a high of 48 F (9 C), smashing temperature records, while even Miami and Key West will flirt with record cold Sunday and Monday, meteorologists said.

The outlook for Florida was cold enough to raise concerns about damage to the state’s citrus and strawberries.

“We’re going into a brutally cold period,” Maue said.

Storms keep on coming

After this weekend storm, long-range models see another one at the end of the first week of February, Maue said. Meteorologists see the East stuck in a pattern of bitter cold and snowstorms because of the plunging Arctic air and warm water.

East Coast snowstorms don’t happen too often, but “when it happens, it happens in bunches,” said former National Weather Service director Louis Uccellini, who has written meteorology textbooks on winter snowstorms.

        <hr/>
        WASHINGTON — After Donald Trump and his top aides rushed to portray Alex Pretti as a “gunman,” “domestic terrorist” and “would-be assassin” in the hours after he was shot and killed by Border Patrol agents on Saturday, the president shuttled back and forth between the Oval Office and his adjacent private dining room, where he watched news coverage of the incident and fielded calls from concerned aides, lawmakers and other allies, according to two senior administration officials.

Trump already had posted an image of Pretti’s legally permitted Sig Sauer P320, along with a message referring to Pretti as a “gunman” whose firearm was “loaded (with two additional full magazines!), and ready to go.”

But as he absorbed clips of the fatal confrontation, and the news reports surrounding it, Trump grew increasingly disturbed by what he saw, according to one of the senior administration officials.

“He doesn’t like chaos on his watch,” the official said.

If Trump wasn’t ready to change the tactics, he was starting to understand that he needed to change the optics.

By Sunday night, Trump decided to hit the reset button while preserving the mass-deportation operation he promised to execute during his 2024 presidential campaign. After all, in the signature tax and spending legislation of his second term, Trump and Congress had provided an additional $170 billion for the Department of Homeland Security, including tens of billions of dollars for detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants and billions more for recruiting federal agents.

This account of how Trump came to the conclusion that he needed to switch the script — dominated by the shooting deaths of two American citizens, the fast-declining popularity of his deportation tactics and calls for the ouster of prominent administration officials — was told to NBC News by 15 sources, many of whom were granted anonymity to speak candidly.

It is hard to overstate how much is at stake for Trump, and for his Republican Party, both in terms of the substantive goal of deporting millions of undocumented immigrants and the politics of appealing to swing voters before the midterms. It is inconceivable to some of his allies that he would alter the underlying aim of the mission.

“The reality is, you can’t stop what you’re doing,” said a former White House official. “This is the whole point of ICE existing in these cities, and Minnesota is not going to be the last state that ICE goes to. Oregon was next. We were not done. We need to keep going.”

On Monday, Trump executed a bureaucratic face-lift by removing confrontational Border Patrol commander-at-large Greg Bovino from the scene in Minneapolis, subbing in border czar Tom Homan — widely viewed as more placative — and effectively sidelining Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Trump also spoke by phone with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Democrats he has harshly criticized in the past, about turning down the temperature.

While those moves may assuage establishment Republicans in Congress — and political independents distressed by the violence in Minnesota — they do not come without a cost for Trump among the MAGA base voters who did not want to see any sign of retreat from the hard-core immigration crackdown, said one Republican strategist with ties to the White House.

“The conservative base is pissed” about what they see as signs of weakness in his new approach in Minnesota, the strategist said, arguing that Trump is “demoralizing” voters he needs to turn out for Republicans in this year’s midterm elections. At the same time, Trump’s aides have broken into ugly rounds of finger-pointing over the botched initial response to the shooting, blaming one another in private conversations with reporters.

A botched response

When federal agents encountered Pretti on a street in Minneapolis on Saturday morning, Washington, D.C., was bracing for a major snowstorm. Trump had recently returned from Switzerland, where he had agreed to compromise on his plans to take Greenland.

Just after 9 a.m. in Minneapolis, Border Patrol agents killed Pretti. “Shots fired in Minneapolis,” Bovino alerted on a text-message chain with top White House and DHS officials about five minutes later, at 10:10 a.m. in Washington, according to the senior administration official. Within the hour, Noem spoke to Trump about the shooting.

By 11 a.m. ET, Walz had talked with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, and he posted to X his demand that Trump withdraw “thousands of violent, untrained officers” from his state. Despite the heated rhetoric, Walz and Wiles had a productive first conversation. She would become a key intermediary between Walz and Trump, working over the weekend to lay groundwork for the president and governor to speak directly.

Seven minutes after Walz’s tweet, at 11:10 a.m., DHS launched its public-relations campaign, telling reporters on “background,” without naming a particular official, that the “suspect had a firearm with two magazines — situation evolving.” The agency then shared a photo of a handgun, which it said was taken from the victim, sitting on a car seat. The implication from DHS was that Pretti had been a threat to federal agents.

What unfolded in the aftermath would lead to perhaps the most intense interagency blame-casting of Trump’s second term.

At 11:30 a.m., the first draft of a public statement circulated among top officials at the White House and DHS, and these officials negotiated for nearly an hour over the exact wording of the information they would release to the public.

Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and longtime Trump adviser who has broad authority over immigration enforcement — including a supervisory role over Noem and her DHS team — later said that officials in Washington worked from information provided by Customs and Border Protection, the agency that encompasses the Border Patrol, which is also part of DHS.

“The initial statement was based on reports from CBP from a very chaotic scene on the ground. That’s precisely why an investigation is underway and DHS will let the facts lead the investigation,” a DHS spokesperson said.

But when DHS’s official X account tweeted the statement at 12:31 p.m., not all of the key players at the White House had signed off on it yet, according to the senior administration official. Some aides realized it was out only when they looked up at the TV and saw it on Fox News.

The statement said that Pretti, who had not been identified publicly by name, “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” It accused him of having “violently resisted” being disarmed and asserted that an agent, “fearing for his life” fired “defensive shots.”

In a Minneapolis news conference that began shortly thereafter, state and local officials confirmed that Pretti had a gun in his possession when he was confronted by Border Patrol agents and noted that he had a permit to carry it.

His shooting followed a Jan. 7 incident in which Renée Nicole Good, a 37-year-old Minnesota woman, was killed by a federal agent in her car. Witness videos show that at the moment the federal officer fired his first shot into the front of Good’s SUV, its wheels were directed away from him. His legs appeared to be clear of the car. The second and third shots into the open driver’s side window came as the car was moving.

Her death became an instant partisan flashpoint, with some of Trump’s supporters and officials calling her a “domestic terrorist“ and arguing that she endangered the agent by driving at him, and the president’s critics insisting that the agent had no reason to fear for his safety.

After first blaming Good for driving at the agent — inaccurately claiming that she “ran him over” in an interview with The New York Times — Trump later called the incident a “tragedy.”

On Saturday, the administration was racing to define another crisis. Officials leaned on Bovino’s version of events. Miller took on the role of chief spokesperson for the White House position, sending three tweets between 1:22 p.m and 1:43 p.m. in which he called Pretti “a domestic terrorist” who tried “to assassinate federal law enforcement,” a “would-be assassin” and “an assassin.”

Trump followed suit at 2:06 p.m., posting the picture of Pretti’s firearm with the message referring to him as a “gunman.”

Bovino, who had been appointed to the new role as commander-at-large last year and became the face of aggressive immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles, Chicago and Minneapolis, held a news conference in which he repeated the talking points DHS used in its initial statement. “This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement,” he said.

Video clips of the shooting that contradicted the administration’s version of the deadly altercation were already whipping across social media platforms. But officials including Vice President JD Vance reposted Trump’s “gunman” statement, and Noem, at an early evening news conference on the impending snowstorm, repeated the allegation that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist.”

“When you perpetuate violence against a government because of ideological reasons and for reasons to resist and perpetuate violence, that is the definition of domestic terrorism,” she said. Noem, a noted gun enthusiast, suggested, as others in the administration did, that the possession of a firearm and ammunition made Pretti an inherent threat to law enforcement officers.

Throughout the day, Second Amendment advocates, many of them Republicans and Trump supporters, bristled at the notion that a man with a permit to carry his weapon in public should be shot for doing so.

Inside the White House, Trump, an inveterate consumer of television news, assessed the images on his screen.

“He’s the smartest guy I know, and he saw it wasn’t playing well,” said a GOP lawmaker who spoke to Trump on Saturday.

In Minneapolis, Trump had hoped to win the argument over so-called sanctuary cities, where municipal officials refuse to cooperate fully — or at all — with federal immigration enforcement agents, and to highlight allegations that Somali-Americans are at the heart of a massive scheme to defraud the federal government of daycare subsidies. Instead, those aims were being frustrated by weeks of videos of federal officers strong-arming civilians, culminating in Saturday’s killing of Pretti.

“He knows the sanctuary city debate is a good one,” the lawmaker said. “But the visuals were not playing well. He understands TV. … He saw it for himself.”

Still, as guests gathered at the White House that same night for a private black-tie screening of the first lady’s new documentary, “MELANIA” — Queen Rania of Jordan and Apple CEO Tim Cook among them — there was no public indication from Trump that he was displeased with the conduct of Border Patrol or anyone else in his administration.

Time for a change

On Sunday morning, administration officials fanned out on public affairs programs, giving Trump and White House aides — as well as the American public — an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of their narrative.

Bovino addressed the rights of gun owners in the context of federal law enforcement on CNN, adopting a line of argument that Trump, the survivor of a 2024 assassination attempt, has echoed in the days since.

“What I’m saying is we respect that Second Amendment right, but those rights don’t — those rights don’t count when you riot and assault, delay, obstruct and impede law enforcement officers, and most especially when you mean to do that beforehand,” he said, sparking a new round of criticism from gun rights advocates. He offered no evidence that Pretti, who never drew his weapon, intended to harm — much less shoot — federal agents.

In mirror comments on ABC News and Fox News, respectively, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and FBI Director Kash Patel blamed Pretti for carrying his gun in a place where federal agents were confronted by protesters.

“You cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest that you want,” Patel said. “It’s that simple. You don’t have that right to break the law and incite violence.” He also faced a backlash over his seeming disregard for the Second Amendment and over the conflict with his past support for people bringing guns to protests.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, appearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” said that he did not know if Pretti had been disarmed before he was shot.

Behind the scenes, Wiles expressed her displeasure with the way DHS was handling the messaging, and she privately urged Trump to send Homan to Minneapolis, according to a person familiar with her discussions. Trump also fielded calls Sunday from allies who worried that the situation was spiraling out of control. Some of them also suggested that he send Homan, who had been honored by President Barack Obama for his work on immigration, to Minneapolis.

By Sunday night, Trump had signaled to aides that he was ready to change his lineup and his public posture, and White House staff set a news briefing for Monday.At the same time, a senior administration official told NBC News, Trump planned to keep his immigration enforcement policy intact and continued to have discussions with advisers about invoking the Insurrection Act in order to deploy the military to Minneapolis.

New team, same policy

On Monday morning, Trump connected with Homan by phone, and Homan offered to go to Minneapolis to take over the operations there. He said he believed he could negotiate with Democratic officials to secure greater cooperation in locating and removing undocumented immigrants with criminal backgrounds. They then met in person Monday afternoon as well, according to a White House official with knowledge of the meeting.

With the path already laid out by Trump’s allies and aides, the president said that dispatching Homan was a “great” idea and announced the move publicly on social media. Bovino was stripped of his commander-at-large title and sent back to the El Centro, California, border region, where he had worked before being elevated to carry out interior operations.

Later that morning, Trump spoke with Walz for the first time since the shooting, describing their discussion as a “good call” and saying they "seemed to be on a similar wavelength" — a noticeable shift in tone toward the governor. At a news briefing Monday afternoon, press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to defend the way in which Noem and Miller attacked Pretti on Saturday, when they accused him of seeking to assassinate federal agents.

“I have not heard the president characterize Mr. Pretti in that way,” Leavitt said.

And by Monday night, after Homan had arrived in Minneapolis, Noem and Corey Lewandowski, her most influential adviser and a former Trump campaign manager, met with the president at the White House, according to two White House officials and a DHS official. The DHS official described that meeting as “positive.”

It wasn’t until Tuesday around noon — more than three days after Pretti’s death — that Trump first appeared on camera to address the situation in Minneapolis and his decision to change his leadership team.

He told reporters that he did not believe that Pretti intended to assassinate anyone, but reiterated his view that “you can’t have guns” in a situation like the one Pretti was in.

He also said Noem would remain in her position, even as Democrats — joined later by two Republican senators — called for her immediate ouster. Most notably, he underscored a shift in tone, if not tactics, in Minnesota, where Homan met with Walz and Frey on Tuesday.

“We’re going to de-escalate a little bit,” Trump said.

On Tuesday night, there was more trouble in Minneapolis. A man confronted Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., at a town hall. He was arrested after trying to spray her with what a preliminary report later showed to be apple cider vinegar, according to Omar’s spokesperson.

Contacted after the attack, Trump told an ABC News reporter he hadn’t yet seen video of the incident, but he nevertheless blamed Omar, whom he frequently targets.

“She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her,” Trump said.

        Guy Fieri has eaten more meals in front of the camera than most of us will eat in a lifetime. He's visited grease pits, culinary classics, and hole-in-the-wall treasures in every region of the U.S., wearing his signature sunglasses that multiple generations know to be synonymous with the best food reviews around. When the Mayor of Flavortown says a restaurant is special, it’s not just good TV; it’s a guarantee of quality recognized nationwide.

Fieri doesn’t keep his favorites a secret, and his picks aren’t about popularity. The five restaurants that left the biggest impression are places that made him drool over each bite and laugh in the face of calorie counting, all in one savory moment.

Together, Fieri’s top spots, recorded by LoveFood, tell a fascinating story of American cuisine. They’re not connected by price or location; they’re united by soul (food, of course). Each restaurant delivers robust, no-nonsense dishes and gives back to its community.

When you’ve dined everywhere, the places you revisit must be in a league of their own. From Midwestern meat havens to modest desert taco joints, these five restaurants define the spirit of Flavortown.

Let’s dig in!

1. LA SCAROLA - CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

2. OLNEYVILLE N.Y. SYSTEM - PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND

3. ROBERTO'S TACO SHOP - LAS VEGAS, NEVADA

4. TOM'S BARBECUE - MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE

5. KUMA'S CORNER - CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

1. LA SCAROLA - CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

Taking the top spot is La Scarola, a beloved Italian American restaurant situated in Chicago's West Loop, featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. Sidestepping the modern twists of trendy Italian eateries, this restaurant is famous for delicious, hearty portions and recipes rooted in tradition.

At La Scarola, both plates and stomachs overflow, sauces are rich, and everyone leaves feeling satisfied. Fieri has dubbed this one of his favorite restaurants in the country, not just in Chicago. From crave-worthy pasta to perfectly seasoned calamari, this spot embodies everything the Mayor of Flavortown looks for in a five-star meal: generous portions, bold flavor, and a down-to-earth atmosphere that celebrates great food and the people enjoying it.

2. OLNEYVILLE N.Y. SYSTEM - PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND

Hot dogs don't usually inspire devotion, but Olneyville N.Y. System has managed to turn a humble sausage into a local obsession and one of Fieri's all-time favorite stops.

Here, "hot wieners" are served "all the way," a local phrase referring to a specific combination of meat sauce, mustard, onions, and celery salt. It's messy. It's savory. It's absolutely impossible to eat politely, which is half the fun. Fieri has labeled these some of the best hot dogs he's ever consumed, which is high praise for a man who's encountered this American delicacy in almost every form imaginable.

3. ROBERTO'S TACO SHOP - LAS VEGAS, NEVADA

Las Vegas is famous for being over the top, but Roberto's Taco Shop is beloved for the opposite. No frills, no celebrity chef advertisements, just deeply satisfying Mexican food that Guy Fieri has raved about since his college days.

That level of loyalty says a lot. Whenever Fieri returns to Vegas, Roberto's is still his go-to for carne asada burritos that make him feel at home in Flavortown. It's a reminder that food doesn't need to be fancy to be legendary. Sometimes the best meal is one that tastes exactly the same every time you eat it.

4. TOM'S BARBECUE - MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE

Tom's Barbecue is the definition of a Tennessee classic. This Memphis staple has been feeding locals for over half a century, serving slow-cooked meats prepared with patience and a deep respect for smoke.

Fieri has praised Tom's for embodying everything great barbecue should be: melt-in-your-mouth meat, undeniable flavor, and a relaxed environment that lets the food speak for itself. The rib tips are so irresistible, you’ll abandon your napkin and dive in without hesitation. There’s no reinvention here; just pure mastery. In a city populated with endless barbecue joints, Tom’s stands out by doing what it’s always done. With barbecue like this, you really can’t go wrong.

5. KUMA'S CORNER - CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

Is Fieri partial to the Windy City, or do its restaurants truly rise above the rest? With two Chicago spots making his top five, you can’t help but wonder.

Kuma’s Corner crafts colossal burgers that are just as fun to marvel at as they are to eat. With a menu inspired by heavy metal music and unapologetic flavors, Kuma’s has achieved cult status in Chicago and earned a permanent place on Guy Fieri’s list of America’s best restaurants.

        <hr/>
        NEW YORK (AP) — No longer confined to the partisans and activists, the fierce backlash against Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has begun to break out across American culture, spanning the worlds of business, sports and entertainment.

Bruce Springsteen released a new song Wednesday that slammed “Trump’s federal thugs.” OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman told employees that “what’s happening with ICE is going too far,” referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And lifestyle icon Martha Stewart lamented that “we can be attacked and even killed.”

“Things must and have to change quickly and peacefully,” Stewart wrote to her 2.9 million Instagram followers this week.

A little more than one year into his second term, Trump is facing a broad cultural revolt that threatens to undermine his signature domestic priority, the Republican Party’s grip on power and his own political strength ahead of the midterm elections.

Trump, a former reality television star often attuned to changes in public opinion, tried to shift the conversation this week by dispatching border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota to replace Greg Bovino, a Border Patrol commander who has been a lightning rod.

But it’s unclear if the move will change anything on the ground.

Thousands of federal agents remain in Minnesota, where two U.S. citizens have been killed and communities have felt besieged by Trump’s crackdown. Meanwhile, operations have expanded into Maine as well.

White House is ‘spooked’

Republican strategist Doug Heye said it’s too soon to know whether Trump’s attempt to control the fallout will work. He’s been in communication with Republican leaders across Washington in recent days who are worried that the escalating situation could jeopardize control of Congress in this fall’s midterm elections.

“It’s very clear that the administration is spooked,” Heye said.

And while some in the party may be concerned, Trump’s Make America Great Again base remains largely unified behind him and the immigration crackdown that he promised repeatedly on the campaign trail. They’re pushing the president not to back down.

“It’s time for President Trump to ramp up mass deportations even more,” Laura Loomer, a Trump loyalist who has the president’s ear, told The Associated Press. “And if Minnesota is any barometer, it’s time for the focus to be on deporting as many Muslims as possible.”

Such advice is at odds with a growing faction of prominent voices across American culture.

Who is speaking out?

Joe Rogan, a leading podcast host who endorsed Trump during his comeback campaign, said he sympathizes with concerns about immigration agents’ tactics.

“Are we really going to be the Gestapo?” Rogan said. “‘Where’s your papers?’ Is that what we’ve come to?”

Over the weekend, more than 60 corporate executives, including the leaders of Target, Best Buy and UnitedHealth, released a public letter calling for de-escalation following the death of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old Veterans Affairs nurse fatally shot during a confrontation with federal agents.

The outcry intensified as the week progressed.

Apple CEO Tim Cook on Tuesday issued a memo to employees saying he was “heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis.”

“I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they’re from, and when we embrace our shared humanity,” Cook wrote in the memo, first reported by Bloomberg News.

Tech billionaire and venture capitalist Vinod Khosla used stronger language on social media to condemn “macho ICE vigilantes running amuck.”

Jason Calacanis, a prominent tech podcaster, on Wednesday warned of dire consequences for Trump if he does not make sweeping changes among the people running the immigration crackdown.

“President Trump needs to replace them all and reverse his plummeting ratings, or the entire Trump 2.0 agenda is over,” Calacanis wrote to his 1 million X followers. “America needs to put this dark and disgusting chapter behind us and unite behind a crisper immigration policy.”

Actors and musicians speak up

More outrage came from the entertainment industry, which is often viewed as a liberal bastion.

Springsteen dropped his new song, “The Streets of Minneapolis,” on Wednesday. The famed musician referenced Pretti’s death directly.

“Trump’s federal thugs beat up on his face and his chest. Then we heard the gunshots. And Alex Pretti lay in the snow, dead,” Springsteen sings.

Other actors and entertainers who spoke out in recent days include Natalie Portman, Elijah Wood, Olivia Rodrigo and Billie Eilish. Actor Mark Ruffalo described Pretti’s death as “cold-blooded murder.”

The sports world has also begun to engage.

Minnesota Timberwolves head coach Chris Finch called the shootings “unconscionable” and expressed support for protesters. So did superstar NBA player Steph Curry.

“There’s a lot of change that needs to happen,” Curry, who plays for the Golden State Warriors, told reporters this week. He said he’s been glued to news coverage of the latest Minnesota shooting.

Guerschon Yabusele, of the New York Knicks, went further the day after Pretti’s shooting.

“I can’t remain silent. What’s happening is beyond comprehension,” he wrote on X. “We’re talking about murders here, these are serious matters. The situation must change, the government must stop operating in this way. I stand with Minnesota.”

Trump may be getting the message

Trump appears to be softening his tone on immigration — at least by his standards.

“We’re going to de-escalate a little bit,” he said during a Tuesday interview on Fox News. He also chided Bovino, whom he displaced from his role.

“Bovino is very good, but he’s a pretty out-there kind of a guy,” he said. “In some cases, that’s good. Maybe it wasn’t good here.”

But Trump pushed back on the characterization that he was scaling back his operations in Minnesota. And in a social media post, he warned Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey that he was “PLAYING WITH FIRE” by refusing to enforce federal immigration laws.

Even before Pretti’s death Saturday, public opinion was starting to turn against Trump on immigration, which was among his strongest issues at the beginning of his second term.

Just 38% of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling immigration, down from 49% in March. That’s according to an AP-NORC poll conducted Jan. 8-11, shortly after the first shooting death of a U.S. citizen in Minnesota.

There’s also some indication that Trump’s approval on immigration could be slipping among Republicans. The president’s approval among self-described Republicans fell from 88% in March to 76% in the January AP-NORC poll.

A separate Fox News poll, which was conducted Friday through Monday, found that 59% of voters described ICE as “too aggressive,” a 10-point increase since last July.

The serious son of Quaker parents, Philip Noel-Baker was first a scholar, then an Olympian, and finally a Nobel Peace Prize winner. He is the only person ever to have won both an Olympic medal and a Nobel.

First, an Olympic medal

By 1912, Noel-Baker had already earned honors in history and economics at Cambridge, and he was on the way to a graduate degree in international law.

But the 22-year-old was also president of the Cambridge Athletic Club, and that July he took some time off from his studies to join the British track and field team for the fifth modern Olympic Games in Stockholm.

It was an eventful Olympiad. The American multi-sport phenom Jim Thorpe easily won the pentathlon and decathlon, prompting an impressed King Gustav V of Sweden to declare Thorpe “the greatest athlete in the world.” That year saw the Olympic debuts of equestrian sports, women’s aquatics, and the nation of Japan.

Great Britain took home a silver in tug-of-war, just one of 41 medals British athletes won that year. Noel-Baker was not among them; he ran the 800 and 1500-meter races, taking sixth place in the latter.

It may not have been his best showing, but Noel-Baker—who hyphenated his name when he married his wife, Irene Noel, in 1915—did better at the next Olympiad, held in Antwerp in 1920, after the 1916 Olympics were cancelled due to World War I.

That year, the 30-year-old won silver in the 1500 meter race, his only Olympic medal. But nearly four decades later Noel-Baker would return to Scandinavia for a gold one.

Then, a Nobel Peace Prize

Noel-Baker’s father, a successful London businessman and dedicated pacifist, put his own belief in public service into action as a member of the London County Council and, later, in the House of Commons. Noel-Baker took after his father, and was dismayed when war came to Europe so soon after the jubilant spectacle of internationalism he had witnessed in Stockholm.

On August 4, 1914, Noel-Baker “listened to Big Ben strike midnight as the Horse Artillery thundered along the Embankment to Victoria to entrain for France,” he later recalled. “And we knew that the guns were already firing, that the First World War had come.”

A conscientious objector, he would devote his own war effort to organizing ambulance services for Allied soldiers injured on the front lines, earning multiple citations for valor. But like many who had seen the worst of the so-called Great War, Noel-Baker returned with an even greater zeal for peace.

After the war, Noel-Baker served as principal assistant to Lord Robert Cecil, one of the architects of the League of Nations (and himself a future Nobel Laureate). He continued working for the League in various capacities throughout the 1920s and for most of the ‘30s, ‘40s, ‘50s and ’60s served in Parliament as a minister from the Labor Party.

After World War II, he joined the effort to replace the flawed League with what would become the United Nations, working tirelessly all the while for multilateral disarmament.

While some of his contemporaries advocated a realpolitik approach, or even hewed to the idea that powerful weapons were the best deterrent against violence, Noel-Baker “believed fervently in the cause of peace and advocated disarmament as the only answer to war,” said Professor Michael E. Cox, Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics, in a 2024 lecture. “In other words, he was not a realist. He was what many called him at the time, a romanticist—dare I even use the word—a utopian.”

Undeterred by Noel-Baker’s critics, the Norwegian Nobel Committee granted him the Peace Prize in 1959, shortly after the publication of his book, The Arms Race: A Programme for World Disarmament, which offered a detailed plan for getting rid of both nuclear and conventional weapons.

Philip Noel-Baker’s legacy

Eight more Olympics had taken place since Noel-Baker won his silver medal, the games interrupted by yet another world war. Meanwhile, new weapons had been developed, weapons more terrible than previous generations could have imagined. Noel-Baker, now nearing 70 years old, used his Nobel Lecture to look back on a dangerous half century, and to issue a warning to the future.

“The arms race still goes on; but now far more ferocious, far more costly, far more full of perils, than it was then,” he said. “It is the strangest paradox in history; every new weapon is produced for national defense; but all experts are agreed that the modern, mass-destruction, instantaneous delivery weapons have destroyed defense.”

Trying to curb war with rules and limits had come to nothing, he argued. Instead, he issued a challenge to the international community, the building of which had been his life’s work, from the track to the treaty table. Proudly utopian to the last, he declared, “I start with a forthright proposition: it makes no sense to talk about disarming unless you believe that war, all war, can be abolished.”

        Live music is magical – there’s no other way to describe it – but even the most visceral, moving or electric performance by your favourite artist takes on a whole new life if it’s performed in an equally dazzling venue.

That’s why Time Out has compiled a list of the most beautiful concert venues in the world, from stages and concert halls to opera houses and amphitheatres. Our list features landmark venues like the Sydney Opera House, Teatro alla Scala and Beijing’s National Centre for Performing Arts, but one historic arena has topped all of those to claim the crown.

The most beautiful live music venue this planet has to offer is Colorado’s legendary Red Rocks Amphitheatre. The open-air slopes offer breathtaking views over the state’s 160 million sandstone formations, making it one of the most unique places to see live music on the planet.

Recommended: These are the 8 best concerts worth travelling for in 2026.

‘The arena can hold up to 9,500 people and has hosted everyone from Jimi Hendrix to deadmau5,’ says Time Out contributor India-Jayne Trainor. ‘It’s dwarfed on both sides by two dramatic 300ft monoliths made from red sandstone, which help magnify the acoustics from the main stage, where films, concerts and even fitness classes are held throughout the year’.

Other intriguing entries on this list include Dalhalla, a 6,000-capacity arena in Rättvik, Sweden, nestled in an eerie limestone quarry; The Caverns, a gig space in Tennessee in an ancient underground network of caves; and Musikverein, a gilded Vienna concert hall home to the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.

Check out Time Out’s brand-new list of the world’s most beautiful concert venues.

        <hr/>
        There is generations’ worth of wisdom about what to eat when one is convalescing — and something faintly romantic about the ritual of it, spoon by spoon nourishing yourself back from the brink, until one day you look up from a bowl of chicken soup and realize, with a small shock, I feel like myself again.

But what of the days when you aren’t really sick, you just don’t have an appetite? You wake up and feel a little off — maybe it’s sadness, maybe it’s excitement, maybe it’s burnout, maybe it’s just the weather and your inbox conspiring against you. Either way, you’ve landed in the appetite gap: you’re hungry, but not hungry-hungry. Every dish you imagine feels either too heavy or too insubstantial. You know you need to eat, but nothing sounds good.

Consider this a guide for those days, from someone who has lived enough of them — and loves food enough to have developed a surprisingly rigorous philosophy about what, exactly, to do when desire disappears.

The first thing that helps is to stop thinking in dishes and start thinking in sensations.

Instead of wrestling with the endlessly broad question What do you want?, try something gentler and more specific. What temperature could you tolerate right now? Do you need crunch or acid? Softness, or something slurpable? And — perhaps most importantly — how much energy do you actually have to expend? (Low desire often travels with low motivation to get in the kitchen, though not always, and that information matters.)

It can help to think in loose categories — less a rubric than a set of handles you can grab when decision-making feels like too much:

Temperature: cold, room temperature, warm-but-not-hot, steaming

Texture: slurpable, crunchy, soft, spoonable

Flavor note: acid, salt, gentle umami, creaminess

Effort: one pan, one bowl, zero chopping

Once you start thinking this way, certain foods begin to reveal themselves — not as recipes so much as answers. Here are some of my favorites.

Cold-brewed green tea

Something broke in my body when I turned 32 and my caffeine tolerance plummeted seemingly overnight. I was recently reminded of this after having what I thought was a cute little mid-afternoon coffee, only to wake up at three in the morning acutely aware of every cell in my body, my heart racing, my breath shallow. Was I having a heart attack? Dying? No — just profoundly over-caffeinated.

Which, I suppose, makes it a little charming that one of my favorite parts of the day now is opening the fridge for breakfast and reaching for the big glass jug of cold-brewed green tea I keep on hand (it used to hold cold-brew coffee, but alas, no more). While it isn’t food, it reliably supports me on days when I know appetite is going to be a problem — and when dumping caffeine onto an empty stomach would only make things worse.

My current favorite is a blend of bancha green tea and dried yuzu peel. I steep a few bags overnight in cold, filtered water, which yields a lightly sweet, lemony green tea that’s smooth and refreshing, less verdant and tannic than its hot-brewed counterpart, and infinitely gentler than chilled coffee. It’s not breakfast, exactly—but it makes breakfast possible.

Rice and egg bowls

For something warm and grounding that my body can reliably handle, I have a go-to breakfast: rice and eggs. Sweet breakfasts have never been my natural habitat—good oatmeal is a beloved, comparatively rare exception, as is a single yeasty, griddled buttermilk diner pancake swimming in syrup. Mostly, I want something hearty that isn’t a three-egg omelet or a cheesy BEC on a toasted bagel.

Enter my dummy-simple version: I start the rice cooker before taking my dog, Otto out, and when I return, I spoon a bit into a small bowl and slide a quick over-easy egg on top. A drizzle of soy sauce, a scatter of scallions, and always — always — some lemon zest, which cuts through the yolk’s richness and, once blended, produces what my brain now registers as lazy hollandaise. Warm, savory, digestible, familiar—I reach for this most mornings, appetite or no.

Part of what makes the rice-and-egg bowl such a reliable ally against the “Nothing sounds good” demons is its modularity. You can riff depending on fridge contents or, after a brief sensory inventory, what feels right in the moment. Crisped bacon, chopped into uneven bits like salty candy? Fatty slices of avocado, dusted with everything bagel seasoning or drizzled in chili crisp? If you caught onto the feta-egg trend of yesteryear, here’s a perfect time to deploy it. All of it works. All of it is permissible.

Soft-on-the-body soups

Soup is the obvious recommendation for days when appetite has gone AWOL, but two in particular stand out as personal MVPs: the “tiny everything” pastina and rotisserie chicken congee. They sit in similar registers — closer to porridge than broth, a texture that my brain immediately interprets as nourishing.

For the pastina, I cook finely chopped carrots, onions, and celery until soft, then remove and blend about half until silky smooth. Back in the pot it goes, along with chicken stock, pastina (or any other teeny-tiny pasta shape) and frozen miniature meatballs—sometimes homemade, sometimes store-bought. What’s important is that they all hit temperature together, resulting in a warm, savory bowl that quietly covers protein, carbs, and some vegetables, all without fuss.

Then there’s the congee.

Late last year, I visited a pop-up at HAIBAYÔ, a Vietnamese coffee shop and community space in my Chicago neighborhood. One special featured a comforting rice porridge, simmered until thick and creamy, studded with Costco rotisserie chicken—an unparalleled convenience food. It’s a brilliant way to bulk up a basic congee recipe (or swap it in for the mini-meatballs in the pastina) with almost no extra effort, and somehow, the ritual of stirring and watching it thicken makes the body believe it’s getting exactly what it needs.

A better smoothie

For years, I never bothered making smoothies at home. I was stuck in the strawberry-banana register, and honestly, the frozen fruit section of the supermarket felt intimidatingly small. My early smoothie experiments ended with a freezer full of ice-burned banana slices and sad curls of kale — truly the saddest smoothie packs imaginable.

But the world of frozen fruit has expanded, and surveying bags of mango, wild blueberries and dragon fruit inspired me to develop a few go-to smoothies for low-appetite days — because sometimes, the only way you want (or can) get nutrition is through a straw. It’s also a perfect moment to sneak in some supportive protein: protein powder, silken tofu, or nut butters.

A few things I’ve learned along the way: I like using slightly sweetened, roasted fruit, usually prepped in a big batch at the start of the week. It gives the smoothie a jammy backbone, while frozen banana provides the “ice” element. Don’t sleep on seasoning: warming spices like cinnamon, allspice and cardamom, plus baking favorites like ginger, citrus zest, or vanilla, take a smoothie from functional to delicious. And if dairy milk or yogurt feels heavy, plant-based alternatives like coconut or soy milk work beautifully.

Right now, the version I won’t let go of combines honey-roasted peaches, coconut milk, Greek yogurt, a touch of frozen banana and cinnamon — a smoothie that somehow feels indulgent while still quietly supporting the body.

Crunch, without commitment

Another low-desire-day favorite is what I internally call a “crunch plate.”

It’s a small, deliberate collection: thin-cut vegetables—slightly-thicker-than-paper radish slices, slim carrot and cucumber matchsticks, sugar snap peas pre-snapped in half—some crackers (the more durably woven and Triscuit-like, the better), maybe a pickle spear or two and a herby, creamy dip. The dip is nothing fancy: Greek yogurt, a squeeze of lemon, a swirl of miso and whatever herbs happen to be languishing in the fridge — usually dill and parsley.

It’s deceptively simple, but intentional. The thin-cut vegetables make it easy to nibble a bite at a time, rather than staring down a full head of lettuce in a salad bowl. Crunch, as a sensation, sometimes works like a gentle tether back to appetite. Best of all, it’s snacky, which feels low-pressure, but nourishing enough to count as a meal.

Chilled noodle salads

When it comes to chilled noodle salads, I think of two main varieties.

There’s the Italian-style pasta salad, tossed in olive oil and vinegar and studded with olive-bar favorites — roasted red pepper, artichoke hearts, basil — and perhaps some deli stalwarts, like chopped cured meats or cheeses. Then there are the Chinese or Taiwanese cold sesame noodles: bouncy wheat noodles dressed in a creamy, savory, nutty sauce of sesame paste, soy, black vinegar, garlic, chili oil and sugar, usually topped with fresh, crunchy additions, like julienned cucumber, cilantro, peanuts and scallions.

Advertisement:

I love both because they thrive in the gray area of appetite: nothing too hot, nothing too cold, nothing that makes me recoil from a bite. They’re forgiving, flexible and satisfying in a quiet, slurpable way.

Room-temperature, savory, slightly textured — these salads often hit my sweet spot when I want something that exists between snack and dinner.

Just a really good turkey sandwich

Sometimes the answer is the thing you already trust. Sourdough bread, thin-sliced turkey, and a smear of Kewpie — that’s my base. If I’m feeling saucy, shredded iceberg and Swiss join the party. The number of times I’ve let out a relieved sigh at the sight of these familiar components should probably tell me something about myself.

And here’s a truth I like to remember on rough days: when it comes to nourishment, you don’t have to make it beautiful. You can eat the same thing three days in a row. Repeating foods isn’t a failure—it’s information, a quiet signal of what your body actually wants.

At the end of the day, eating something is enough.

Appetite comes and goes. Some days, it whispers; other days, it hides behind everything else you’re carrying. Feeding yourself is not a test, nor a performance—it’s an ongoing conversation between your body, your mind and the world you’re navigating.

So, above all, when nothing sounds good, start small. Start with what asks the least of you: a spoonful, a sip, a slice, a bite. Let eating be not just another demand, but a way back to yourself.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> After years of Hollywood exile following multiple sexual misconduct allegations in 2017, director Brett Ratner is making a career comeback through his close ties with Donald Trump. His return includes a feature-length documentary about Melania Trump and a planned production of Rush Hour 4, highlighting how personal connections to the Trump family have facilitated his re-entry into the industry.

        <hr/>
        For a moment, it really did look like Brett Ratner might never work in Hollywood again. In October 2017, a former talent agency employee accused the Rush Hour director of rape. Days later, as Ratner began suing her for libel, a further six women came forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct.

Olivia Munn alleged he had “furiously” masturbated in front of her on a film set. Another actor, Natasha Henstridge, claimed he “physically forced” her to perform oral sex. Arriving in the wake of the high-profile allegations against Harvey Weinstein that sparked the #MeToo movement, the accusations were taken seriously. Within days, Ratner’s multi-million-dollar production deal at Warner Bros had been shredded, and Playboy announced that his planned Hugh Hefner biopic had been, like the filmmaker himself, decisively cancelled.

Thus began a period of Hollywood exile for Ratner, who “categorically” denied all the allegations against him and has never faced charges. Once considered one of the most bankable filmmakers in the industry, it has been over a decade since the 56-year-old last brought a film to theatres.

That will change this weekend when Ratner returns with Melania, a feature-length documentary about the First Lady, holding its premiere Thursday night at Washington DC’s Kennedy Center. Ratner’s connection to Donald Trump dates back to 2011, when he filmed scenes for Tower Heist at Trump Tower. Trump later told guests at former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s 2017 wedding that he was a fan of Ratner’s work — particularly Rush Hour.

Ratner’s decision to answer Melania Trump’s call in 2024 has since led to additional Trump-focused projects, including a documentary on the Abraham Accords. According to The Wall Street Journal, the director has grown close to the couple while living in an eight-bedroom house in Mar-a-Lago.

Next, he is set to direct Rush Hour 4, a sequel to his blockbuster action-comedy trilogy, which Paramount greenlit after the president personally requested it. Ratner’s unexpected career resurgence is further evidence of an old adage he’s long dedicated himself to proving: It pays to have friends in high places.

Born in Miami Beach in 1969, Ratner got his first taste of life on a film set when he appeared as an extra in 1983’s Scarface. A few years later, while studying at New York University, he became friends with Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons and began making music videos for his artists. In recent years, Simmons has himself faced multiple accusations of rape and sexual misconduct.

After establishing himself as a music video director, Ratner was just 28 when he made his feature debut with Money Talks in 1997. The Chris Tucker and Charlie Sheen-led comedy was widely panned by critics but proved a box-office success, grossing nearly double its $25 million budget.

The following year, Ratner had the runaway success that really made his name. He paired Tucker with Hong Kong martial arts icon Jackie Chan for Rush Hour, which made $245 million on a $35 million budget. Ratner recalled later that he celebrated by calling Quentin Tarantino and saying: “I got the biggest check of my life and I have never been on a jet so I am renting one, let’s go to Vegas!”

From his earliest days in the industry, Ratner surrounded himself with high-profile figures he considered friends and mentors, such as The Godfather producer Robert Evans. When he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame early in 2017, he told Variety: “My closest friends are James Toback, Roman Polanski, Warren Beatty, Bob Evans.”

Just months later, Bugsy screenwriter Toback became another high-profile subject of #MeToo allegations and was recently ordered to pay a total of $1.7 billion to 40 women who accused him of sexual abuse and other crimes. Polanski, meanwhile, pleaded guilty to having sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old in 1977 before fleeing the United States, and has since faced further rape accusations.

Ratner’s successful box office run continued into the 2000s, a decade which saw him direct two Rush Hour sequels as well as big-budget entries in the Silence of the Lambs (2002’s Red Dragon) and X-Men (2006’s The Last Stand) franchises. During this period, he styled himself as a jet-setting playboy, throwing lavish parties at his home at Hilhaven Lodge, the Beverly Hills estate once owned by Casablanca star Ingrid Bergman. He dated Serena Williams, making an appearance in the tennis superstar’s reality show Venus & Serena: For Real in 2005, in which he repeatedly yelled “Sexy legs!” at her sister Venus during a match. Serena broke up with him, on air, soon after.

In 2008, a reporter for the Jewish Journal wrote that while interviewing Ratner in the “gold lamé disco basement” at his home, he asked her out on a date, before claiming to be misunderstood. “I don’t drink; I don’t do drugs,” he said. “Do I like to have fun? Yeah. Do I like to enjoy myself, enjoy my life? Yeah. But I’m not a decadent person. I’m not into dark stuff. I’m just a nice Jewish kid from Miami Beach who loves movies and pretty girls.”

Ratner came into contact with the Trumps in 2011 when he directed the action comedy Tower Heist, based on an idea by Eddie Murphy, who originally pitched the film as “Trump Heist” and envisioned an all-Black crew of disgruntled workers stealing from Trump Tower. In the final film, all references to Trump had been removed, although several of his New York properties were used in the production. At the New York premiere, Ratner was photographed alongside Donald, Melania and disgraced rap mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs, who is currently serving a four-year sentence for prostitution-related charges.

Even before #MeToo, Ratner’s brash arrogance had begun to get him into trouble. While promoting Tower Heist, the director used a homophobic slur when he declared: “Rehearsal is for f***.” He apologized, but was nonetheless forced to resign from producing that year’s Oscars.

After his exile from Hollywood, Ratner continued to display an unerring ability to attach himself to the wealthy and powerful. In 2023, he relocated to Israel, where he became close with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. That same year, he posted a photograph of himself with Netanyahu at the United Nations General Assembly on Instagram, writing: “Whatever your political predispositions are, a historic Peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia is good for the world. WE should all be rooting for it!!!!”

He is less keen to brag about some of his other powerful connections. Last month, a photograph of Ratner was among the files released by the Department of Justice related to their investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. In an undated picture, Ratner is seen hugging a topless man who has been identified as the late model agent and Epstein associate Jean-Luc Brunel. Brunel died by suicide in a prison cell in Paris in 2022 while facing charges of raping a minor.

When Melania Trump decided she wanted to make a documentary about herself late in 2024, it was Ratner who answered the call. “He understood how to bring this cinematic, stylized quality to the film that the First Lady envisioned,” Marc Beckman, Melania’s senior advisor, told The Times.

Beckman, who has known Ratner since his advertising agency hired the director in 2007 for a provocative jeans campaign starring a topless Heidi Klum, also negotiated the unusually high $40 million deal for the documentary with Amazon MGM.

“I thought I was being punked,” one veteran agent told Puck last year about learning of the inflated fee, while Hollywood insiders have noted that Amazon did the deal weeks after Jeff Bezos’s Washington Post pulled their endorsement of Kamala Harris and Bezos appeared prominently at Trump’s inauguration.

Ratner’s big-screen comeback, then, might not prove to be the tell-all revelation it is being marketed as. Still, the film has already made at least one fan happy.

        <hr/>
        This is a column about AI. My boyfriend works at Anthropic. See my full ethics disclosure here.

I.

One of my chief biases as a tech journalist is that I like trying new software. Show me a promising new tool and I will, at the drop of a hat, give my entire inbox and calendar over to it. Over time I have begun to rein in this tendency, recognizing that I typically lose more time to so-called productivity tools than I gain from them. And yet still, whenever I read about some groundbreaking widget, I find myself reaching to download it.

And so last week, when I read a piece titled “Clawdbot Showed Me What the Future of Personal AI Assistants Looks Like,” I knew I was in trouble. The article, written by the great Federico Viticci at MacStories, described an open-source, locally running artificial intelligence that connected to all the most important services in his life. He spoke to it via voice notes and Telegram, and used it to replace (for free) automations that he previously paid for on Zapier. If he could imagine it, Viticci wrote, there was a good chance the tool — then called Clawdbot — could build it. It made him wonder what future apps would even have once AI became sufficiently powerful.

Viticci wrote:

Clawdbot is a boutique, nerdy project right now, but consider it as an underlying trend going forward: when the major consumer LLMs become smart and intuitive enough to adapt to you on-demand for any given functionality – when you’ll eventually be able to ask Claude or ChatGPT to do or create anything on your computer with no Terminal UI – what will become of “apps” created by professional developers? I especially worry about standalone utility apps: if Clawdbot can create a virtual remote for my LG television (something I did) or give me a personalized report with voice every morning (another cron job I set up) that work exactly the way I want, why should I even bother going to the App Store to look for pre-built solutions made by someone else? What happens to Shortcuts when any “automation” I may want to carefully create is actually just a text message to a digital assistant away?

These are excellent questions. The more I have been using Claude Code, the more I have found myself wondering the same things. For the moment, Claude Code has several limitations that prevent it from taking over the computer in the way that Viticci describes. And yet, reading about Clawdbot, I became curious whether that future might be closer than I imagined.

And so last Saturday, I visited the website for Clawdbot.

In many ways, Clawdbot resembled Claude Code. The resemblance was close enough that Anthropic asked its solo developer, Peter Steinberger, to change the name. Thus Clawdbot is now Moltbot; I’ll refer to it as such throughout the rest of this article.

Like Claude Code, Moltbot is installed via a terminal command and can then interact with the large language model of your choice. (You have to bring your own API key; I plugged in keys from Anthropic, OpenAI and Google to enable various different features.) Also like Claude, Moltbot can generate text and write code.

But Moltbot differs from a normal LLM in a handful of ways I found appealing.

One, it runs locally on your machine. (In my case, a 2024 M4 MacBook Pro.) Messages get sent to the AI providers, of course. But the core infrastructure, which handles Moltbot’s memory, scripts and other tools, stays on your computer.

Two, you can add it to the messaging app of your choice: Telegram, Discord, Slack and Signal among them. This is nice for several reasons, one of them being that it makes it easy to message Moltbot from your phone.

And three, Moltbot promised to have a persistent memory. Claude Code forgets much of what happens in any given session, and must constantly be reminded. Moltbot creates a series of daily notes about your interactions that it can load into the LLM’s context window, allegedly giving it improved recall compared to a standard command-line tool.

Over on YouTube, recommendations led me to several hypebeasts who promised me that Moltbot would do much more. Creators on X and YouTube said they had bought Mac minis to allow the tool then known as Clawdbot to run continuously. “Clawdbot is the most powerful AI tool I’ve ever used in my life,” read the title of a representative video from Alex Finn, who assured me that Moltbot would serve as my “24/7 AI employee.” Another creator promised to tell me “How I use Clawdbot to Run My Business and Life 24/7.”

By the end of the weekend, Best Buy had sold out of Mac minis in San Francisco.

I was convinced. I installed Moltbot with that single command, and onboarding proved refreshingly simple. (It was, in hindsight, the high-water mark of my time with the tool.)

Within 10 minutes or so, I had wired up Moltbot to many of the core systems I use in my life: an email account, my calendar, Notion, Todoist, and Capacities, among others. Once that was working, I set about working on the project that would come to define the week I spent with Moltbot: a highly personalized morning briefing that would bring together all the strands of my life into a single place.

II.

I realize this project sounds kind of boring.

But one, it offered me a chance to see what Moltbot could do with all of those services I had stitched together. Two, if it worked, I would create something unique to me that I wouldn’t have been able to build myself.

And finally — which I realized only at the end of the process — the specific ways in which it broke persuaded me to uninstall Moltbot from my computer.

By accessing or signing up to receive Communications, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

Our Websites include multiple domains such as mozilla.org, mozillians.org, firefox.com, mozillafestival.org, openstandard.com, openbadges.org and webmaker.org.

Some Websites allow you to create a username during registration. Your use of a username must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy.

3. Content Licensing

Our Communications include content such as articles, images, photographs, comments, software code, audio and video clips, and other materials (collectively, “Content”). Content is authored by Mozilla, contributors to Mozilla projects, and other sources.

Content authored by Mozilla is generally made available for public sharing and reuse through open licenses such as Creative Commons (for expressive material) or the Mozilla Public License (for software code). In most cases we ask Mozilla contributors to release Content under open licenses.

Some Content in our Communications is acquired from sources that prohibit further use of their Content without advance permission. Where possible, the Content or Website footer will display a notice with the applicable license. You agree to abide by such notices. Note the following specifics:

Some Content expressly indicates that the author does not intend for an open license to apply. You should contact the author or author’s agent for permission to use such Content. Questions on Mozilla authored content can be sent to: licensing@mozilla.org.

You represent and warrant that you have the rights necessary to grant the rights granted herein, and further, that the uses contemplated under these Terms will not infringe the proprietary or intellectual property rights of any third party.

In all such cases, these Terms shall terminate, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: Indemnification, Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability, Miscellaneous.

9. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Mozilla, its contractors, contributors, licensors, and partners; and the respective directors, officers, employees and agents of the foregoing ("Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all third party claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of or related to your use of our Communications (including, but not limited to, from your Submissions or from your violation of any these Terms).
