It plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, can operate more reliably in larger codebases, and has better code review and debugging skills to catch its own mistakes. And, in a first for our Opus-class models, Opus 4.6 features a 1M token context window in beta.</p><p>Opus 4.6 can also apply its improved abilities to a range of everyday work tasks: running financial analyses, doing research, and using and creating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. Within <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview">Cowork</a>, where Claude can multitask autonomously, Opus 4.6 can put all these skills to work on your behalf.</p><p>The model’s performance is state-of-the-art on several evaluations. For example, it achieves the highest score on the agentic coding evaluation <a href="https://www.tbench.ai/news/announcement-2-0">Terminal-Bench 2.0</a> and leads all other frontier models on <a href="https://agi.safe.ai/">Humanity’s Last Exam</a>, a complex multidisciplinary reasoning test. On <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/gdpval-aa">GDPval-AA</a>—an evaluation of performance on economically valuable knowledge work tasks in finance, legal, and other domains<sup>1</sup>—Opus 4.6 outperforms the industry’s next-best model (OpenAI’s GPT-5.2) by around 144 Elo points,<sup>2</sup> and its own predecessor (Claude Opus 4.5) by 190 points. Opus 4.6 also performs better than any other model on <a href="https://openai.com/index/browsecomp/">BrowseComp</a>, which measures a model’s ability to locate hard-to-find information online.</p><p>As we show in our extensive <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-6-system-card">system card</a>, Opus 4.6 also shows an overall safety profile as good as, or better than, any other frontier model in the industry, with low rates of misaligned behavior across safety evaluations.</p><div><div><div><button><span>Knowledge work</span></button><button><span>Agentic search</span></button><button><span>Coding</span></button><button><span>Reasoning</span></button></div><div><div><figure><img alt="Bar charts comparing Claude Opus 4.6 to other models on GDPval-AA" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F6e29759b50e8b3a8363b38b1f573d854df968671-3840x2160.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Opus 4.6 is state-of-the-art on real-world work tasks across several professional domains.</figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><img alt="Bar chart comparing Opus 4.6 to other models on DeepSearchQA" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F018d6d882034d50727948b22e3ad3844a43ee09c-3840x2160.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Opus 4.6 gets the highest score in the industry for deep, multi-step agentic search.</figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><img alt="Bar charts comparing Opus 4.6 to other models on Terminal-Bench 2" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fb8cfd7ebd6c82febce5f428f519d68a5dcf5d16f-3840x2160.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Opus 4.6 excels at real-world agentic coding and system tasks.</figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><img src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fb8d511155f209c57e4d6a92ab115ebfc7c8832ff-3840x2160.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Opus 4.6 extends the frontier of expert-level reasoning.</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><p>In Claude Code, you can now assemble <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams"><em>agent teams</em></a> to work on tasks together.

Our engineers write code with Claude Code every day, and every new model first gets tested on our own work. With Opus 4.6, we’ve found that the model brings more focus to the most challenging parts of a task without being told to, moves quickly through the more straightforward parts, handles ambiguous problems with better judgment, and stays productive over longer sessions.</p><p></p><p>Opus 4.6 often thinks more deeply and more carefully revisits its reasoning before settling on an answer. This produces better results on harder problems, but can add cost and latency on simpler ones. If you’re finding that the model is overthinking on a given task, we recommend dialing effort down from its default setting (high) to medium. You can control this easily with the <code>/effort</code> <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort">parameter</a>.</p><p></p><p>Here are some of the things our Early Access partners told us about Claude Opus 4.6, including its propensity to work autonomously without hand-holding, its success where previous models failed, and its effect on how teams work:<br></p><div><div><div><div><div><div><img alt="Notion logo" src="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/images/4zrzovbb/website/7cfef6cd8ce2515a6abd52560ac4189f89f9ad35-116x40.svg"></div><div><svg><path></path></svg></div><blockquote><div>Claude Opus 4.6 is the strongest model Anthropic has shipped.

On our automated behavioral audit, Opus 4.6 showed a low rate of misaligned behaviors such as deception, sycophancy, encouragement of user delusions, and cooperation with misuse. Overall, it is just as well-aligned as its predecessor, Claude Opus 4.5, which was our most-aligned frontier model to date. Opus 4.6 also shows the lowest rate of over-refusals—where the model fails to answer benign queries—of any recent Claude model.</p><div><figure><img alt="Bar charts comparing Opus 4.6 to other Claude models on overall misaligned behavior" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F569d748607388e6ed42e3ff0ff245d9b0cde6878-3840x2160.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>The overall misaligned behavior score for each recent Claude model on our automated behavioral audit (described in full in the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-6-system-card">Claude Opus 4.6 system card</a>).</figcaption></figure></div><p>For Claude Opus 4.6, we ran the most comprehensive set of safety evaluations of any model, applying many different tests for the first time and upgrading several that we’ve used before. We included new evaluations for user wellbeing, more complex tests of the model’s ability to refuse potentially dangerous requests, and updated evaluations of the model’s ability to surreptitiously perform harmful actions. We also experimented with new methods from <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/team/interpretability">interpretability</a>, the science of the inner workings of AI models, to begin to understand why the model behaves in certain ways—and, ultimately, to catch problems that standard testing might miss.</p><p></p><p>A detailed description of all capability and safety evaluations is available in the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-6-system-card">Claude Opus 4.6 system card</a>.</p><p></p><p>We’ve also applied new safeguards in areas where Opus 4.6 shows particular strengths that might be put to dangerous as well as beneficial uses. In particular, since the model shows enhanced cybersecurity abilities, we’ve developed six new cybersecurity <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/next-generation-constitutional-classifiers">probes</a>—methods of detecting harmful responses—to help us track different forms of potential misuse.</p><p>We’re also accelerating the cyber<em>defensive</em> uses of the model, using it to help find and patch vulnerabilities in open-source software (as we describe in our new <a href="https://red.anthropic.com/2026/zero-days/">cybersecurity blog post</a>). We think it’s critical that cyberdefenders use AI models like Claude to help level the playing field. Cybersecurity moves fast, and we’ll be adjusting and updating our safeguards as we learn more about potential threats; in the near future, we may institute real-time intervention to block abuse.</p><h2>Product and API updates</h2><p>We’ve made substantial updates across Claude, Claude Code, and the Claude Developer Platform to let Opus 4.6 perform at its best.</p><p></p><p><strong>Claude Developer Platform</strong></p><p>On the API, we’re giving developers better control over model effort and more flexibility for long-running agents. To do so, we’re introducing the following features:</p><ul><li><strong>Adaptive thinking.</strong> Previously, developers only had a binary choice between enabling or disabling extended thinking. Now, with <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking">adaptive thinking</a>, Claude can decide when deeper reasoning would be helpful. At the default effort level (high), the model uses extended thinking when useful, but developers can adjust the effort level to make it more or less selective.</li><li><strong>Effort. </strong>There are now four <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort">effort</a> levels to choose from: low, medium, high (default), and max. We encourage developers to experiment with different options to find what works best.</li><li><strong>Context compaction (beta).</strong> Long-running conversations and agentic tasks often hit the context window. <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/compaction">Context compaction</a> automatically summarizes and replaces older context when the conversation approaches a configurable threshold, letting Claude perform longer tasks without hitting limits.</li><li><strong>1M token context (beta).</strong> Opus 4.6 is our first Opus-class model with 1M token context. Premium pricing applies for prompts exceeding 200k tokens ($10/$37.50 per million input/output tokens).</li><li><strong>128k output tokens.</strong> Opus 4.6 supports outputs of up to 128k tokens, which lets Claude complete larger-output tasks without breaking them into multiple requests.</li><li><strong>US-only inference. </strong>For workloads that need to run in the United States, <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/data-residency">US-only inference</a> is available at 1.1× token pricing.</li></ul><p><strong>Product updates</strong></p><p>Across Claude and Claude Code, we’ve added features that allow knowledge workers and developers to tackle harder tasks with more of the tools they use every day.</p><p>We’ve introduced <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams">agent teams</a> in Claude Code as a research preview. You can now spin up multiple agents that work in parallel as a team and coordinate autonomously—best for tasks that split into independent, read-heavy work like codebase reviews. You can take over any subagent directly using Shift+Up/Down or <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a>.</p><p>Claude now also works better with the office tools you already use. Claude in Excel handles long-running and harder tasks with improved performance, and can plan before acting, ingest unstructured data and infer the right structure without guidance, and handle multi-step changes in one pass. Pair that with Claude in PowerPoint, and you can first process and structure your data in Excel, then bring it to life visually in PowerPoint. Claude reads your layouts, fonts, and slide masters to stay on brand, whether you’re building from a template or generating a full deck from a description. Claude in PowerPoint is now available in research preview for Max, Team, and Enterprise plans.</p></div>

	<a href="https://variety.com/t/youtube/">YouTube</a> generated more than $60 billion in revenue for 2025, including both advertising and subscriptions, the first time parent company Alphabet has broken out total revenue for the platform.</p>



<p>
	That makes YouTube much larger than subscription-streaming leader Netflix, which reported $45.18 billion in revenue for full-year 2025. Indeed, the top-line number for YouTube was more than any other entertainment company except Disney ($95.7 billion in revenue for calendar year 2025).

	Meanwhile, YouTube also notched its biggest-ever ad sales number to date for the fourth quarter of 2025. However, that ad haul came in below Wall Street forecasts.</p>



<p>
	In the last three months of the year, YouTube’s global ad revenue totaled $11.38 billion, a year-over-year increase of 8.7%, parent company Alphabet reported. Wall Street analysts on average forecast YouTube ad revenue coming in at $11.84 billion, per StreetAccount. On the brand advertising front, YouTube saw lower political ad spending in the most recent quarter compared with Q4 2024.</p>



<p>
	According to Pichai, the NFL saw its highest paid-subscriber total for the Sunday Ticket out-of-market package available through YouTube for the most recent season (but he didn’t say what that number was). In October 2025, viewers watched more than 700 million hours of podcasts on YouTube on TVs, up 70% year over year, he said.

	Overall, Alphabet, also the parent of Google, posted Q4 revenue of $113.8 billion (up 18%) and net income of $34.5 billion (up 30%), or $2.82 per share. That handily topped analyst consensus estimates for $111.43 billion revenue and EPS of $2.63.</p>



<p>
	Alphabet is seeing its AI investments and infrastructure “drive revenue and growth across the board,” according to Pichai. He said that to “meet customer demand and capitalize on the growing opportunities we have ahead of us,” the company expects capital expenses to be $175 billion to $185 billion for 2026, which would be as much as double the $91.4 billion in capex for 2025.</p>



<p>
	During the quarter, YouTube inked a deal with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/oscars-youtube-2029-1236610989/">exclusive global rights to the Oscars</a> awards ceremony beginning in 2029 and running through 2033, nabbing the media rights from ABC. Last month the <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/global/bbc-confirms-landmark-youtube-deal-1236636483/">BBC announced a partnership with YouTube</a> under which the U.K. broadcaster will produce original content for the platform and launch new YouTube channels aimed at children and young adults.</p>



<p>
	YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, in his 2026 letter to the community outlining the platform’s priorities for the year, touted new AI tools coming for creators and said <a href="https://variety.com/2026/digital/news/youtube-channels-using-ai-tools-reduce-slop-neal-mohan-letter-1236636548/">more than 1 million channels used YouTube’s AI tools daily</a> in December 2025. At the same time, the rise of artificial intelligence has raised concerns about “AI slop,” he said, and YouTube is working on “reducing the spread of low-quality, repetitive content.”</p>



<p>
	YouTube Shorts, the platform’s short-form video format, now averages 200 billion daily views, according to Mohan. This year, YouTube will integrate different formats, like image posts, directly into the Shorts feed. In addition, YouTube TV will soon launch a “fully customizable multiview” feature, letting users watch several live channels on one screen, and will roll out <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/youtube-tv-plans-genre-specific-cheaper-sports-espn-unlimited-1236605324/">at least 10 lower-cost, genre-specific YouTube TV plans spanning sports, entertainment and news</a>.</p>

        <div><p><span><a href="/quotes/SNAP/">Snap</a><span><span><button><span></span></button></span></span></span> shares were up over 2% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the Snapchat parent released fourth-quarter earnings that beat on sales. </p><p>The company also announced a $500 million stock repurchase program.</p><div></div><p>Here is how the company did compared with Wall Street's expectations:</p><ul><li><strong>Earnings per share</strong>: 3 cents. That figure is not comparable to analysts' estimates.</li><li><strong>Revenue</strong>: $1.72 billion vs. $1.70 billion expected, according to LSEG </li><li><strong>Global daily active users</strong>: 474 million vs. 478 million expected, according to StreetAccount</li><li><strong>Global average revenue per user (ARPU)</strong>: $3.62 vs. $3.56 expected, according to StreetAccount</li></ul><p>The social media company said first-quarter revenue will be in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.53 billion, which is below analyst estimates of $1.55 billion. </p><p>Sales in Snap's fourth quarter rose 10% year over year, while net income was $45.2 million, which was up nearly 400% from the $9.1 million it reported a year ago.</p><p>Snap said that fourth-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, was $358 million, topping the $300 million that StreetAccount was projecting.</p><p>The company also said that its adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter will be between $170 million and $190 million. That midpoint is higher than StreetAccount's estimates of $178 million.</p><div></div><p>Snap's fourth-quarter global DAU dropped by 3 million quarter-over-quarter, which the company attributed to a reduction in marketing spending "in order to focus on more profitable growth," according to a letter to investors.</p><p>Additionally, Snap said that due to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/australia-plans-to-ban-social-media-for-under-16s-experts-call-it-a-momentous-step.html">Australia's social media minimum age act,</a> the company "implemented platform-level age verification" in that country during the fourth quarter that resulted "in the removal of approximately 400,000 accounts."</p><p>The company said that DAU for the North American region was 94 million, lower than the 97 million that Wall Street was projecting. <br><br>Snap shares dipped slightly in after-hours trading when an analyst asked the company's executives during an earnings call about potential regulatory challenges. <br><br>"Obviously, there's quite a bit working its way to the court system right now that would further restrict the use of Snapchat for our community," Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said during the earnings call about the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/27/tiktok-settlement-social-media-addiction-meta-youtube.html">regulatory environment</a>. Still, he said, the company's global ad sales stemming from users under the age of 18 is "not material."<br><br>"Looking at the revenue-generating potential of the business looking forward, we're not overly concerned about the changing regulatory environment," Spiegel said.</p><p>In the letter, Snap said it plans to focus on growing its subscription-related offerings, like Snapchat+ and the recently debuted Memories Storage Plans. The company said overall subscribers to those services grew 71% year over year to 24 million in the fourth quarter.</p><p>"Certainly memory storage plans were a big driver of the subscriber growth that we've seen recently," Spiegel said.</p><p>Last week, Snap announced that it had created a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/snap-establishes-specs-subsidiary-for-its-ar-glasses.html">wholly owned subsidiary named Specs Inc.</a> that will develop and market the company's augmented reality glasses. </p><p>"We're super excited about what's ahead this year with the launch of Specs, and obviously graduating from the R&amp;D phase of Specs to broader consumer adoption," Spiegel said about the company's <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/snap-specs-smart-glasses-ar.html">upcoming AR glasses</a> slated to debut in 2026.</p><p>Because the company's AR glasses "appeals to a different audience segment than the core Snapchat audience," Spiegel said, it's "going to be really important for us to develop a standalone brand identity for Specs."</p><p>Spiegel said that while "there may be opportunities to raise additional capital" for the company's AR glasses-related efforts in the future, Snap will need to be "balancing" the outside investment with its "own ownership interest and any potential dilution."</p><p><strong>WATCH</strong>: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/10/28/snap-ceo-evan-spiegel-metas-glasses-are-what-we-built-10-years-ago.html">Snap CEO Evan Spiegel on AR glasses</a>.</p></div>

        <div><p><span><a href="/quotes/PINS/">Pinterest</a><span><span><button><span></span></button></span></span></span> CEO Bill Ready rebuked staffers who created an internal tool to track layoffs at the company, and fired those involved. </p><p>"Healthy debate and dissent are expected, that's how we make our decisions," Ready said at a companywide meeting last week, according to audio obtained by CNBC. "But there's a clear line between constructive debate and behavior that's obstructionist." </p><div></div><p>Pinterest <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/27/pinterest-layoffs-stock-ai.html">announced</a> on Jan. 27 that it would lay off less than 15% of its workforce and cut back on office space as part of a broader restructuring aimed at directing resources toward artificial intelligence projects. The company said it expects the layoffs will be complete by the end of September.</p><p>Following the announcement, Pinterest's technology chief addressed the layoffs in a meeting. Some employees asked which teams were impacted and whether more job cuts were coming, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the meeting was private. </p><p>Several Pinterest engineers then created an internal software tool to try and quantify the layoffs. Pinterest fired the engineers on Friday, the person said. It's unclear how many employees were let go. </p><p>Ready defended the moves at an all-hands meeting on Friday, saying Pinterest was facing a "critical moment" in the industry. Employees should consider a job elsewhere if they're "working against the direction of the company" and disagree with its mission, he said. </p><p>Ready said Pinterest wouldn't disclose detailed information about the layoffs out of a concern for staffers' privacy.</p><div></div><p>"I know people have natural curiosity around these things," Ready said. "We shared some of those major structural changes. The smaller ones, those will be communicated at the team level." </p><p>A Pinterest spokesperson confirmed the engineer incident and town hall meeting, but declined to comment on the firings.</p><p>"After being clearly informed that Pinterest would not broadly share information identifying impacted employees, two engineers wrote custom scripts improperly accessing confidential company information to identify the locations and names of all dismissed employees and then shared it more broadly," the spokesperson said. "This was a clear violation of Pinterest policy and of their former colleagues' privacy."</p><p>After this article was published, several Pinterest employees contacted CNBC and disputed the company's characterization of the incident. </p><p>Pinterest fired the engineers after they posted instructions showing how to prompt the company's staff directory to show who was laid off, the employees said. The employees said Pinterest's claim that the engineers created custom software was inaccurate, and said the directory tool is accessible to anyone in the company.</p><p>Pinterest has been investing heavily in AI to surface more personalized and relevant content, and to keep users returning to its platform. It's also rolled out automated tools for marketers in an effort to better compete with digital ad leaders <span><a href="/quotes/META/">Meta</a><span><span><button><span></span></button></span></span></span> and <span><a href="/quotes/GOOGL/">Google</a><span><span><button><span></span></button></span></span></span>. </p><p>Investors have <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/pinterests-ai-strategy-focuses-users-want?rc=wf4boz">raised concerns</a> around whether the increasing popularity of consumer chatbots from OpenAI, Google and others could steal users and ad dollars away from Pinterest. There's particular consternation around the use of AI agents for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/24/amazon-faces-a-dilemma-fight-ai-shopping-agents-or-join-them.html">shopping</a>, "which compresses the market of discovery and purchase on competing platforms," Wedbush analysts wrote in a research note last week.</p><p>Pinterest shares are down 20% so far this year after dropping 11% in 2025. </p><p>"We can't tolerate from each other obstructionism, especially when we have a mission that is so meaningful but also where the odds are stacked against us," Ready said. "We think we can beat those odds, but as a small purpose driven player competing against the largest companies in the history of the world, the only way that we succeed is if we work together, constructively, with clarity and focus."</p><p>More recently, Pinterest's <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/04/pinterest-pins-q3-earnings-report-2025.html">advertising sales slowed</a> as some large U.S. retailers weathered the impact of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/">President Donald Trump's</a> tariff policies.  </p><p>Tech companies have continued to downsize this year as they look for more ways to increase efficiencies and invest in AI. <span><a href="/quotes/AMZN/">Amazon</a><span><span><button><span></span></button></span></span></span> last week said it would <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/amazon-layoffs-anti-bureaucracy-ai.html">lay off</a> about 16,000 corporate employees, after it let go 14,000 staffers in October.

<p>Newsletter platform Substack is notifying users of a data breach after attackers stole their email addresses and phone numbers in October 2025.</p>


<p>Although the incident occurred four months ago, CEO Chris Best told affected users that Substack only discovered the breach this week. However, while the attackers stole some users' data, Best added that they didn't access credentials or financial information.</p>


<p>"On February 3rd, we identified evidence of a problem with our systems that allowed an unauthorized third party to access limited user data without permission, including email addresses, phone numbers, and other internal metadata," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/newsguy.bsky.social/post/3me3dhsexmt2s">Best said</a> in breach notification emails sent today.</p>

<div>
 <a href="https://www.wiz.io/lp/secure-images-101-a-visual-guide?utm_source=bleepingcomputer&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=FY26Q4_INB_FORM_Hardened-Images-101-Digital-Poster&amp;sfcid=701Py00000WFCeLIAX&amp;utm_term=FY27-bleepingcomputer-article-970x250&amp;utm_content=Secured-Images-101"><img src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/c/w/Secured-Images-970x250.png" alt="Wiz"></a>
</div>


<p>"This data was accessed in October 2025. Importantly, credit card numbers, passwords, and financial information were not accessed."</p>


<p>Although Substack has yet to share how many users were affected by the incident, on Monday, a threat actor leaked a database on the BreachForums hacking forum containing 697,313 records of allegedly stolen data.</p>


<p>They also claim to have scraped the data and noted that "the scraping method used was noisy and patched fast."</p>

<p>While it didn't explain how the attacker gained access to the stolen data or reveal the full impact of the data breach, Substack says it has addressed the flaw exploited in the attack and warned of potential phishing attempts that could exploit the stolen information.</p>


<p>"We have fixed the problem with our system that allowed this to happen," Best added. "We do not have evidence that this information is being misused, but we encourage you to take extra caution with any emails or text messages you receive that may be suspicious."</p>


<p>A Substack spokesperson didn't share further details regarding the incident when BleepingComputer reached out, but said that "safeguards have been put in place to help prevent this issue from happening again."</p>


<p>Almost six years ago, in July 2020, Substack accidentally <a href="https://x.com/Substack/status/1288283848220893185">exposed some users' email addresses</a> in a privacy policy update email by including them in the 'to' line instead of the 'bcc' field.</p>


<p>Since its launch in 2017, Substack has gained popularity among independent journalists and content creators, reaching five million paid subscriptions by March 2025.</p>

<p>Bitcoin and other altcoins began <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bitcoin-price-plunge-crypto-falls-jan-29"><u>experiencing</u></a> a noticeable <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-prices-continue-to-drop-jan-30"><u>downturn</u></a> in the market late last week. Crypto analysts provided key market levels for Bitcoin to hold in order to avoid the worst. Some analysts said holding at $80,000 would be key while others said $70,000. Falling below those levels, analysts said, could drive further decline as investors look to sell off their holdings. </p><section>

<p>Bitcoin has now fallen below both key levels. Now, some analysts are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/bitcoin-price-today-70000-in-focus.html" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>saying</u></a> that Bitcoin could land in the $60,000 to $65,000 range while others are forecasting potential further drops landing the cryptocurrency at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2026/02/02/bitcoin-could-plunge-all-the-way-to-40k--zacks-john-blank.html?" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>$40,000</u></a>.</p><p>The downturn isn't unique to crypto, as stocks especially in the tech sector are currently dropping, but cryptocurrency is experiencing the worst of it. As a highly volatile and still largely unproven asset class, crypto is among the first investments to go in a sell-off from institutional investors.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/Cointelegraph/status/2019330732645343739" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>report</u></a> from CryptoQuant, institutional firms that were buying up tens of thousands of Bitcoin just last year are now net sellers this year.</p><p>Social media users are noticing that other whales are also selling off, which further tanks the price of Bitcoin. World Liberty Financial, the crypto company owned by the Trump family, <a href="https://x.com/TedPillows/status/2019409661125095758" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>liquidated</u></a> more than $5 million of its Bitcoin holdings on Thursday. </p>

<p>Get ready for some selfies that are out of this world. NASA astronauts will be allowed to bring their smartphones to space for the first time, starting with the Crew-12 and Artemis II missions.</p>

<p>Crew-12 is expected to head to the International Space Station <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/commercialcrew/2026/01/28/nasas-spacex-crew-12-begins-quarantine-for-space-station-mission/">next week</a>, while the highly anticipated Artemis II mission — which will <a href="https://time.com/7346146/artemis-ii-launch-nasa-astronauts-moon-mission/">bring humans around the moon</a> for the first time since the 1960s — was delayed until March.</p>

<p>“We are giving our crews the tools to capture special moments for their families and share inspiring images and video with the world,” NASA administrator Jared Isaacman <a href="https://x.com/NASAAdmin/status/2019259382962307393">wrote</a> on X.</p>

<p>With the newest iPhones and Android devices at hand, the crew will be able to be a bit more spontaneous with image and video gathering, meaning that for those of us back home, these upcoming trips to space could end up being some of NASA’s most well-documented journeys yet.</p>

<p>Imagine how cool (or cringe-worthy) it will be if astronauts turn themselves into TikTok stars in zero gravity, or if they take ultra-wide-angle selfies in the spacecraft. For those working in government bureaucracy, it’s equally exciting, apparently, that NASA approved this rule change pretty quickly.</p>

<p>“Just as important, we challenged long-standing processes and qualified modern hardware for spaceflight on an expedited timeline,” Isaacman wrote. “That operational urgency will serve NASA well as we pursue the highest-value science and research in orbit and on the lunar surface.”</p>

<p>It makes sense that it would be hard to approve new technology to go into space — if one small thing goes astray, a spaceflight can go terribly wrong. Until now, the newest cameras that were supposed to go on these missions were decade-old Nikon DSLRs and GoPros, according to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-will-finally-allow-astronauts-to-bring-their-iphones-to-space/">Ars Technica</a>. That’s by no means arcane, but there’s something more spontaneous and whimsical about using a smartphone.</p>

                    <p>Apple just posted a <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/best-ever-iphone-sales-quarter-takes-apple-to-25-billion-active-devices">record quarter</a> with its highest-ever iPhone sales, but the company is now gearing up to launch its next phone, the iPhone 17e, on Feb. 19, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2881175/iphone-17e-release-date-specs-features-price.html" title="(Opens in a new tab)">Macworld reports</a>.</p><p>The date falls on a Thursday, which is not a day Apple usually reserves for hardware launches. It is, however, the same date the <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-iphone-16e">iPhone 16e</a> debuted. Like last year, Apple may avoid an event to announce the phone and instead unveil it through a press release, the report adds.</p><p>The iPhone 16e resembles the <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-iphone-14">iPhone 14</a>, and it replaced the budget SE model in the iPhone lineup. The phone comes with a 6.1-inch OLED display, the A18 processor, support for <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/is-apple-intelligence-actually-smart-i-tested-every-feature-to-find-out">Apple Intelligence</a>, a single 48MP rear camera, and the C1 modem. </p><div>

<p>The iPhone 17e is expected to retain the 16e’s design, while receiving four major internal upgrades.

				<p><span>This year will be, without a doubt, the biggest year for Apple, not only because Apple will launch several exciting all-new products, but this year also marks the 50th anniversary, or semicentennial, of the company’s founding. Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, held an all-hands meeting with its employees earlier today, and this was what Cook teased for the employees, according to </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/apple-s-cook-vows-to-lobby-lawmakers-on-immigration-issue?embedded-checkout=true"><span>Mark Gurman</span></a><span>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“</span><span>I’ve been unusually reflective lately about Apple because we have been working on what to do to mark this moment. When you really stop and pause and think about the last 50 years, it makes your heart sing. It really does. I promise some celebration.” </span><span>-Tim Cook</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>With that kind of announcement, it certainly sounds like Apple is going to celebrate really big for the company’s upcoming anniversary. Apple was co-founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak on April 1, 1976, so it’s only less than two months until Apple celebrates its semicentennial.</span></p><div>

<p><span>We don’t know exactly what Apple is planning for its 50th anniversary, but I could imagine some sort of special-edition Apple product to commemorate its milestone. As a bit of trivia, Apple did offer the special-edition Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh to commemorate the company’s 20th anniversary despite being released in 1997; however, that computer simply crashed and burned due to how outrageously expensive it was. </span></p>

<p><span>However, I could imagine Apple holding a media press event to introduce several new products for the home. Apple held a media event in April 2021 to introduce the updated Apple TV 4K, the first AirTag, the M1 iPad Pro, and the colorful M1 iMac. If you think about it, these products were designed to be used around the home. So Apple could have another event this April again to introduce more home-related products; this would include the next generation Siri, the next Apple TV 4K, the refreshed HomePod mini, the budget MacBook, and the long-rumored “HomePad” device.</span></p>
<p><span>For what it’s worth, these next few months will be very exciting for all Apple enthusiasts, so we will surely cover everything that Apple has up its sleeves. Make sure you bookmark this site to stay updated with the latest content from us!</span></p>

                                        <p>LONDON (AP) — The European Union on Friday accused TikTok of breaching the bloc’s digital rules with “addictive design” features that lead to compulsive use by children, in preliminary charges that strike at the heart of the popular video sharing app’s operating model. </p><p>EU regulators said their two-year <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/european-union-tiktok-digital-regulation-3fd249bbc9ff78a4401827c4b84b71a7">investigation</a></span> found that TikTok hasn’t done enough to assess how features such as autoplay and infinite scroll could harm the physical and mental health of users, including minors and “vulnerable adults.” </p><p>The European Commission said it believes TikTok should change the “basic design” of its service. The commission is the EU’s executive arm and enforcer of the 27-nation bloc’s <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/eu-european-union-digital-services-act-4fc60b69253bcbbf9f46a84cbd93bdaf">Digital Services Act</a></span>, a sweeping rulebook that requires social media companies to clean up their platforms and protect users, under threat of hefty fines.</p><p>TikTok denied the accusations. </p>

<p>TikTok’s features including infinite scrolling, autoplay, push notifications, and highly personalized recommender systems “lead to the compulsive use of the app, especially for our kids, and this poses major risks to their mental health and wellbeing,” Commission spokesman Thomas Regnier said at a press briefing in Brussels. </p>

<p>“The measures that TikTok has in place are simply not enough,” he said. </p><p>The company now has a chance to defend itself and reply to the commission’s findings. Regnier said “if they don’t do this properly,” Brussels could issue a so-called non-compliance decision and possible fine worth up to 6% of the company’s total annual revenue. There was no deadline specified for the commission to make a final decision.</p>

<p>The preliminary findings are the latest example of pressure that TikTok and other social media platforms are facing over youth addiction. </p><p>Australia has <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/australia-social-media-ban-under-16-children-8b992efa5138704bc02ee9fc974f6987">banned</a></span> social media for under-16s while governments in <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/spain-social-media-ban-children-under-16s-77ac5a2e2078f175bd61dbfb5ad9deb7">Spain</a></span>, <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/france-social-media-ban-children-d3c4010741dd1a39f61c1f6d5bb3c85b">France</a></span>, <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/britain-social-media-ban-australia-teen-harm-c59c76db73a8c1cfac28c8264738e395">Britain,</a></span><span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/denmark-social-media-ban-children-7862d2a8cc590b4969c8931a01adc7f4">Denmark,</a></span><span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/malaysia-social-media-ban-under-16-1e9e20321c8c83c470ff7489139f10b8">Malaysia</a></span> and <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/egypt-parliament-social-media-children-elsissi-8ea06fec852f3a2addb13eb341527732">Egypt</a></span> want to introduce similar measures.

He added that 7% of children aged 12 to 15 spend four to five hours daily on TikTok, and it’s “by far” the platform most used after midnight by children aged 13 to 18, citing unspecified data. </p><p>“These statistics are extremely alarming,” he said. </p><p>The commission said that TikTok fuels the urge to keep scrolling because it constantly rewards users with new content, leading to reduced self control.</p><p>It said TikTok ignores signs that someone is compulsively using the app, such as the amount of time that minors spend on it at night, and how often the app is opened. </p>

<p>The company has failed to put in place “reasonable, proportionate and effective” measures to offset the risks, it said. </p><p>The commission said TikTok’s existing time management controls are easy to dismiss and “introduce limited friction,” while parental tools need “additional time and skills” from parents. </p><p>Changes that the commission wants TikTok to make include disabling features like infinite scroll; putting in more effective breaks for screen time, including at night; and changing its “highly personalized” recommender system, which feeds users an endless stream of video shorts based on their preferences. </p><div></div><p>TikTok says it has numerous tools, such as custom screen time limits and sleep reminders, that let users make “intentional decisions” about how they spend their time on the app. The company also noted it has teen accounts that let parents impose time limits on use, and prompt teen users to switch off in the evenings. </p><p>___ </p><p>Associated Press journalist Sam McNeil in Brussels contributed to this report. </p>

        <div><div><p>An elixir for keeping our brains and bodies younger may already be sitting on pharmacy shelves across the United States — if only we’d take advantage of it.</p></div><div><p>I’m talking about the shingles vaccine.</p></div><div><p>It was invented because, well, <a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/diseases/shingles-herpes-zoster?">shingles</a> is a terrible disease. If you ever had chickenpox (like I did), this virus is lurking inside your body already. Shingles is the reactivation of the same varicella zoster virus later in life. It can lead to painful red rashes that last for weeks, and for some people, they will suffer from debilitating nerve pain for the rest of their lives.</p></div><div><p>The debut of <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa051016?">the first shingles shot in 2006</a> was a big public health win for that reason alone. But the benefits may be even greater than we realized at the time.</p></div><div><div><div></div><div><div><h2>Sign up for the Good Medicine newsletter</h2></div></div><div><p>Our political wellness landscape has shifted: new leaders, shady science, contradictory advice, broken trust, and overwhelming systems. How is anyone supposed to make sense of it all? Vox’s senior correspondent <a href="/authors/dylan-scott">Dylan Scott</a> has been on the health beat for more than a decade, and every week, he’ll wade into sticky debates, answer fair questions, and contextualize what’s happening in American health care policy. Sign up <a href="/pages/good-medicine-newsletter-signup">here</a>.</p></div></div></div><div><p>Over the past year, there has been a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x">steady</a> <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422%2825%2900455-7/fulltext">stream</a> of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/gerona/glag008/8430804?utm_source=chatgpt.com&amp;login=false#google_vignette">studies</a> <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833335?">showing</a> that the shingles vaccine doesn’t just stop the painful skin rashes — it could also stave off dementia and slow our biological aging.</p></div><div><p>A recent study that tracked specific biomarkers in human samples strengthened the case that there is a genuine cause-and-effect. The science surrounding the shingles vaccine is a new window into <em>how </em>we age and how we might even slow it down. These findings could open doors to powerful new anti-aging, anti-dementia treatments.</p></div><div><p>But that will require more investment — and researchers working on these projects told me it’s been surprisingly hard to find the necessary financial support. Just as importantly, we need to get more seniors to take the vaccine: As of now, less than a third of eligible Americans over 50 are getting their shingles jab.</p></div><div><div><h2>The remarkable anti-aging shingles shot</h2></div></div><div><p>The first shingles vaccine, released in 2006, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa051016?">decreased</a> the risk of shingles by 60 percent and also reduced by two-thirds the risk of long-term nerve pain. Experts said at the time that the shot “represents a major public health advance.”</p></div><div><p>But it was only within the last year that the awesome dementia-defeating powers of the shingles vaccine started to come into focus.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/pascal-geldsetzer">Pascal Geldsetzer</a>, who researches population health at Stanford University, spotted an opportunity: In 2013, Wales had established new standards for who could receive the shingles vaccine. People who were born before September 2, 1933, were not eligible, and everyone born on that day or after was. There were two large groups of people who were otherwise the same, differing in age by only weeks, except one of them had received the shingles shot and the other had not. It’s about as rigorous a “natural experiment” as you could hope for. And so a few years ago, Geldsetzer and his co-authors looked back at the country’s comprehensive health records to track what had happened to patients after they received a shingles vaccine (or didn’t).</p></div><div><p>And the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x">results</a>, published in April 2025, were striking: Receiving the shingles vaccine was associated with a 20 percent lower chance of being diagnosed with dementia. Those findings held up to all kinds of veracity checks — and they were repeated in similar natural experiments in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833335?">Australia</a> and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(25)00455-7/fulltext">Canada</a> (the latter also co-authored by Geldsetzer). A December 2025 study based on the same Welsh data <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01256-5">concluded</a> that people who already had dementia and received the shingles vaccine saw slower progression of the disease and fewer deaths, suggesting that the shot may be effective in treating dementia, too.</p></div><div><p>So the circumstantial case for the shingles shot has grown robust — and now we’re starting to get lab-based research that could explain why this is happening.</p></div><div><p>A recent <a href="https://watermark02.silverchair.com/glag008.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAA4QwggOABgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggNxMIIDbQIBADCCA2YGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMlkvgFudtZB_CQhnuAgEQgIIDNwTZ7VFCih6RTtkdKctqzMdg9GS8LfinuIl16gXmEmUgy8BoyFukJQ58mUtBcop6dEi68L_QvrZDOOIZxVAhlu1jNz1ocezCe1goRYHWYumBgmQcRcEGb-fu7aSl5Cfm4HmNJrL4tJkhk0BSCV9J9ub6KGaZ6y4AeUSS1aQycdgMePH3LmhY3X5-lWVhwKjTbsDB3diyHVAbN1XrufyblUm3FlVsfjh3Vo1-8UN7nXtf3AdNpbcR1500Fwgn_uDPe-x8jYsAAhVAhmdtl9GhC2xoaaTzZ4CMNiVdBOkJhLvcH67mbKSSb6vsElrnil7ClzJvgfo_ODJkpeYY1LjAGePi9Me_FGHa47FWwSdafnwwkjQVWRIIwNNzwkhiPJOHcUkJLL2G0Xn7K_E_-1A8iPz-59z9U1RCDXMi-UW8CB3Jr_eDPoBtFW0fVTZOFeFMIE7RLuUQhkZc6cRPa5WBLCbzADgFZWe2wACJbuIAFEQ7ZaXq-afIA6fQxKsdZ3CyZpOelxuhAok-Y3r7JzPDOmkXV9YkL-vPAooT1wOhAezeZvR8hTTXwnUcxz4_PNRNqDGq828Mbdgw832C0CCtJowDeZAkqlkler9OUXX0pUJdcQ4ITWiOPL73hli8PlCGYsredZ8ujfPR4789MC1NlZUH52H3amVakAvhc7SvJbOVhPOjH_0eqpWmYDpxnE87w6NbG8-z2U_PLj-bEMwI6WtR-c-bXP1zlkLCOyXfh5C4rcK_syfaapkxpSMkFrPrQQ65xGQGLA0Gi-PMFa4-LWeDfVEtnxrVGSe8WgHDzsrceRfb8Nhw5p2syOZMXgenyV_iIXymW-QGMAZG0gjd5RvlF9jSmEvOGPcmUaQwEhXMLUNqorsAIdPpZKaicv_3C5pHFNHMtsiQPSoQ0Gs5P1lBAxAQXp8AdIe9jqychTOrQWDJNFywSK2vebRfblv7cOzB4qwXX1SXW1anJbmZsyAjl0i0Z5l7Qjqxh5G1dJq5fF2uLdWkkZ_DdmW-gkAVYykWMBPaTiCDpwD4zpJYo8_TCXZkTKFqKLRnAdars2fqLNSaQ8YKoRQpKdtDkzeUqHQan2rMqHQ">study</a> analyzed biomarker data from blood samples collected by the US government as part of regular surveys monitoring Americans’ health. Whereas the earlier studies were observational, this was an attempt by scientists to actually see what was happening — to measure changes in the body at the molecular level. The researchers found that the vaccine was associated with slower overall biological aging, lower inflammation, and less cell damage. The findings fit with what we’re learning about <a href="/health/474384/what-is-inflammation-causes-how-to-reduce-diet">how chronic inflammation may slowly damage the body</a> over time, leading to various chronic health problems.</p></div><div><p>The study did leave one mystery: The biomarkers specifically linked to dementia did not actually decrease. But the authors noted that we’re still figuring out how to understand the relationship between brain biomarkers and disease. It is possible, for example, that less systemic inflammation leads to less dementia without specifically altering the biomarkers that were tracked.</p></div><div><div><h2>But now money is drying up for vaccine research</h2></div></div><div><p>The existing research largely focuses on the initial vaccine released. But in 2018, an even better version came on the market.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.shingrix.com/about/discover-shingles/">Shingrix</a>, which combined virus proteins with an immunity booster, prevented shingles in more than 90 percent of cases in clinical trials, with similar success in preventing nerve damage. It is now the standard vaccine in the US.</p></div><div><p>But does Shingrix have the same anti-aging effects? Unfortunately, we just don’t know. We need more research — and that’s where all this promising news runs into a brick wall.</p></div><div><p>Ideally, researchers would run randomized clinical trials. But despite these amazing findings, Geldsetzer told me he had been struggling to find financial support to study Shingrix.</p></div><div><div><form><div><div><h2>Good Medicine</h2><p><span>A newsletter for anyone trying to make sense of their health.</span></p></div><div><fieldset><div><div><div><label>Email (required)</label><div><input></div></div></div><button><span>Sign Up</span></button></div></fieldset><div><div>By submitting your email, you agree to our<!-- --> <a href="https://www.voxmedia.com/legal/terms-of-use">Terms</a> and <a href="https://www.voxmedia.com/legal/privacy-notice">Privacy Notice</a>. <!-- -->This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google<!-- --> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> <!-- -->apply.</div></div></div></div></form></div></div><div><p>“I think to really convince the public health and medical community what we need now is a true clinical trial, a randomized trial on the effect of shingles vaccination for dementia prevention and cognition,” Geldsetzer said. “There’s little commercial interest. It’s not been easy at all.”</p></div><div><p>A number of things are working against him and his peers. The initial Welsh research was supported by an NIH grant, but pro-vaccine research <a href="/health/471362/rfk-jr-vaccine-committee-hepatitis-b-shot">does not exactly align with the administration’s priorities</a> under US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s leadership. Drug manufacturers have also been pulling out of the vaccine business <a href="https://epar.evans.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/EPAR_UW_345_Private-Sector-GH-RD_Executive-Summary_0-1.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">for years</a>, a trend that is <a href="https://www.biospace.com/drug-development/sanofi-moves-away-from-mrna-flu-vaccine-as-ceo-projects-confidence">getting worse</a> under the Trump administration.</p></div><div><p>There is a bitter irony here.</p></div><div><p>The shingles vaccine was <a href="http://as01">made possible</a> because pharmaceutical companies, philanthropy groups, and national governments invested in a new vaccine platform while searching for a malaria shot, just one of many examples of how scientific investment can pay off in unexpected ways. But now, money is short.</p></div><div><div><h2>Let’s not miss this tremendous health care opportunity</h2></div></div><div><p>To maximize the shingles vaccine’s value, we need more research, <em>and</em> we need more people to take it. Vaccination rates are still surprisingly low: Only 30 percent of eligible patients <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264410X2500800X#xd_co_f=MWJiMmYxNGUtOTZkYy00MzFkLTg3MDctNDFjODRiZWM4YjNk~">received</a> the shingles shot as of 2022.</p></div><div><p>Lower vaccination rates among men, underrepresented and historically marginalized groups, and lower-income people <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12701292/">suggest</a> this is partly a health care access issue. (Adding to that evidence: People <em>without</em> chronic conditions are also less likely to get it, probably because they have less contact with the health system.)</p></div><div><p>But on top of that, we’re now entering a new era of vaccine hesitancy, even among older people. Vaccination rates among seniors for pneumonia and flu have been <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db547.pdf?ueid=f140c1c4af8bbecbdb57b9f78d0ce81d&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=GM%201.22&amp;utm_term=VoxCare">dropping</a>.</p></div><div><p>This is a big public health test: We seem to have a cheap intervention for aging and cognitive decline.</p></div><div><p>In a more pro-vaccine alternate reality, we might even be pondering questions like: Should even younger people get it? Shingles has grown <a href="https://www.adventisthealthcare.com/living-well/shingles-its-not-just-for-those-over-50/">increasingly common</a> among people in their 30s and 40s, and given the studies so far have found the shot’s anti-aging effects persist for years, the long-term payoff could be immense.</p></div><div><p>Those are the policy challenges. At the personal level, what each of us can do is talk to the seniors in our lives; a lot of them aren’t getting vaccinated. Shingles sucks — and the shot for it might also stave off dementia and slow your body’s aging. Win-win-win.</p></div><div><p></p></div><div><span>See More<!-- -->:<span> </span></span><ul><li><a href="/good-medicine-newsletter">Good Medicine</a></li><li><a href="/health">Health</a></li><li><a href="/health-care">Health Care</a></li><li><a href="/policy">Policy</a></li><li><a href="/public-health">Public Health</a></li><li><a href="/science">Science</a></li></ul></div></div>

                                <!-- start the_content --><!-- mega mega --><!-- adCount: 0--><!-- paragraphcount: 14 4--><p>On February 8, Bad Bunny will headline the Super Bowl Halftime Show (or “Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show,” to go full government). In previous years, he was preceded by Kendrick Lamar, Usher, Rihanna, a group led by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, and the Weeknd. What do those artists have in common? Or, more accurately, what’s missing from that crew? The answer comes quickly to six-string slingers who can provide a detailed list of the differences between a Fender Stratocaster and Telecaster. In short: there’s no rock (unless we’re counting Rihanna’s “Shut Up And Drive”).</p>
<p>There was a time in the not-so-distant past when rock and roll dominated the Halftime Show. (I’m in my mid-30s, so even though TikTok is full of kids making yearning, nostalgia-bait videos about flip-phones and Littlest Pet Shop toys, the 2000s is my “not-so-distant” past.) The first half of the 2000s saw a lot of dual and even group headliners, although not many were themselves rock acts: Phil Collins, Christina Aguilera, and more in 2000; Aerosmith and NSYNC in 2001; Shania Twain and No Doubt in 2003; and a group led by Janet Jackson and a pre-arrest Diddy in 2004. </p>
<p>2005 marked the start of a clear pivot and the reason is obvious. Janet Jackson was part of the previous year’s show, but so was Justin Timberlake. It was the infamous “nipplegate” performance, where Timberlake tore off a piece of Jackson’s outfit and exposed her breast to millions of viewers on live television. The cultural implications of this moment were immense. Everybody from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080307122430/http://dir.salon.com/story/opinion/feature/2004/02/13/zell/index.html">Democratic senator Zell Miller</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040411114159/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20040204-0213-superbowl-jackson.html">Spike Lee</a> spoke out against the stunt. Timberlake introduced the term “wardrobe malfunction” into public consciousness while apologizing at the 2004 Grammys. YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim <a href="https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-10-11-youtube-karim_x.htm">later said</a> the idea for the internet video platform stemmed from the difficulty he faced finding videos of the 2004 Halftime Show (and of a tsunami in Asia from the same year) online.</p><!-- admarker --> <div><div></div></div><!-- inline --><!-- RevContent  <div id="revcontent-hidden"> -->  <!-- revisit -->
<p>Naturally, after that mess, the NFL had a clear desire to play it safe (musically, not with the CTE-inducing brutality of football) the following year. So, they went with Paul McCartney. “People may have concerns of another wardrobe malfunction, but I can safely tell you that I won’t,” the former Beatle <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4241069.stm">said</a> ahead of his performance, adding: “We will pretty much get up there and just use the time allotted to rock.” And that’s exactly what he did. He and his band ran through a four-song set of Beatles and Wings songs, with McCartney making good on his word to not show his silky Liverpudlian skin.</p>
<p>Continuing to exercise caution in 2006, the NFL got another classic and recognizable rock figure to play: The Rolling Stones. The league remained understandably sensitive, so much so that ABC <a href="https://www.today.com/id/wbna11193993">put the performance on a five-second tape delay</a> and censored a couple potentially objectionable lyrics: “You make a dead man come” from “Start Me Up” and “Once upon a time, I was your little rooster / Now am I just one of your cocks” from “Rough Justice.” A band representative later described the censorship as “ridiculous.” Outwardly, though, the performance was another Halftime Show without headline-level issues.</p><!-- admarker --> <div><div></div></div><!-- inline -->
<p>The NFL just kept busting out rocker after rocker from there. The run hit a high point with Prince in 2007, who delivered an epic, rain-drenched performance that is now considered one of the greatest Halftime Shows ever. Rock was clearly working, so that’s where the NFL’s head remained in 2008. The league reportedly had its sights set on Bruce Springsteen, which failed to pan out, then the Eagles <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/eagles-turn-down-super-bowl-prefer-grand-ole-opry-84247/">turned down the gig</a>, so it ended up going to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Springsteen and his E Street Band performed in 2009, breaking down and saying yes after first being asked to play the big game as early as 1975. (Continuing to ask after 30-plus years of rejection should be considered harassment, but I digress.)</p>
<p>By 2010, the NFL was firmly in its classic rock era when they tapped the Who, who had a farewell tour in 1982 but still performed here and there. <em>Rolling Stone</em> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/fans-react-to-the-whos-super-bowl-halftime-performance-113025/">rounded up online comments</a> about the show shortly after it aired: alas, reception was mixed. Most of the positivity seemed to come from the band’s devoted, likely older fans (“I’ve seen them 28 times over the last 25 years and last night at the ripe age of 65 and 64 they were unreal”), while others had more measured takes (“The Who were an amazing band, but you gotta face the fact that they really didn’t sound good”). Retrospectively, the publication’s Rob Sheffield <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/super-bowl-halftime-shows-ranked-from-worst-to-best-14201/the-who-2010-129966/">ranked</a> every Halftime Show in 2024 and the Who was in the bottom portion of the list: “They showed up even more shoddily prepared than the Colts, fumbling a medley of classics—sad to think of all the kids out there first hearing ‘Won’t Get Fooled Again’ or ‘Baba O’Riley’ in this sorry condition.”</p><!-- admarker --> <div><div></div></div><!-- inline -->
<p>Critics were surely relieved when the Halftime Show was under new management in 2011, when the broadcast moved from CBS to Fox. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/blogs/company-town-blog/story/2010-03-25/fox-sports-chief-david-hill-promises-no-geezers-during-next-super-bowl-halftime">In an interview</a>, Fox Sports President David Hill was asked if the next halftime performer would be under 60 years old and he gave an enthusiastic, “Oh, please God yes,” before adding: “I’m watching [the Who] going, ‘Oh no, please.'” These are not the words of a man likely to book Van Halen or Kiss anytime soon. Under Hill’s purview, pop would return to the Super Bowl in a huge way with the Black Eyed Peas, making Fergie the first female co-headliner since Janet Jackson. It was a statement booking: the group was fresh off a run of hits that included “Boom Boom Pow,” “I Gotta Feeling,” “Imma Be” (all #1 singles), “Rock That Body,” and “The Time (Dirty Bit).” The league didn’t look back from there; the next four headliners were Madonna, Beyoncé, Bruno Mars, and Katy Perry.</p>
<p>How has rock fared since that run? Not great, Bob! The closest things to a rock Halftime Show since the Who were Coldplay in 2016 and Maroon 5 in 2019. These are massively successful artists who thrive in their own ways, but they’re “rock” like a pizza Lunchable is pizza. So, when is “real” rock coming back to the Super Bowl? Unless Bad Bunny flashes something more objectionable than a boob on international television this year and the NFL retreats into booking Billy Joel for 2027, it likely won’t be for a long while, if ever.</p>
<p>McCartney, Springsteen, and the Who weren’t hit contemporary artists when they performed, but the appetite for rock music was stronger in the 2000s than it is today. Even if data put together by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1adgk10/every_rock_song_that_peaked_in_the_top_10_of_the/">this Reddit user</a> a few years ago isn’t completely accurate, it seems well-considered and strong enough to be appropriately illustrative in this informal context. They compiled a year-by-year list of all the “rock” songs that made the Top 10 on the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 chart since 2001, using, in their words, “a fairly inclusive definition of rock.” From 2001 to 2009, every year had at least five rock Top 10s, with 2002 having 12 such songs. Those numbers diminished in the early 2010s and from 2016 to 2024, just four songs made the cut: Imagine Dragons’ “Believer,” Olivia Rodrigo’s “Good 4 U” and “Bad Idea Right?,” and Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things.” Hell, if you exclude “Beautiful Things” (go ahead, I won’t put up a fight), 2024 had more Top 10 singles <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVli-tstM5E">name-dropping Nintendo</a> than Top 10 rock songs.</p><!-- admarker --> <div><div></div></div><!-- inline -->
<p>Artists like Geese, Wednesday, Hayley Williams, and Turnstile had some of 2025’s most critically beloved albums, but they’re better suited for a Tiny Desk Concert than the Super Bowl Halftime Show (with apologies to how influential Paramore was and continues to be for generations of rock and rock-adjacent musicians). With a lack of a strong rock presence in contemporary mainstream music, it’s hard to imagine a classic performer making sense for the Halftime Show, especially when the slot could instead go to a proven modern star making music in more relevant genres. (Fleetwood Mac might be the best candidate, given their internet-fueled resurgence in recent years, but <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/10/stevie-nicks-fleetwood-mac-future-barbie.html">a reunion seems unlikely</a> following the death of Christine McVie in 2022.)</p>
<p>When McCartney took the stage in 2005, it was a new direction. Given, it was one motivated by caution, but the league is continuing to experiment today. Bad Bunny and Shakira/Jennifer Lopez were the first Latin acts since Christina Aguilera and Enrique Iglesias in 2000. The two recent performances featuring Kendrick Lamar (guesting in 2022, headlining in 2025) were the first Halftime Shows with a focus on hip-hop since Diddy and Nelly were part of the Jackson/Timberlake debacle in 2004. Mainstream rock Halftime Shows might be dead, but what they initially represented—the NFL changing gears—is still alive and kicking.</p>
<p>If you want to grasp at some straws: Jay-Z and Roc Nation pick the talent for the Halftime Show these days, and given that Jay once made a collaborative remix EP with Linkin Park (2004’s <em>Collision Course</em>), maybe he still has a soft spot for rock. The genre isn’t in an awful place right now: Geese and the aforementioned others show it can still be exciting, while A-list stars like Olivia Rodrigo are unafraid to push a guitar-driven sound. But unless something drastically changes, the days of the dominant rockstar are over. The Halftime Show will likely never again be dominated by rock music like it was during that run from 2005 to 2010… unless at his upcoming performance, Bad Bunny decides to do a set of AC/DC covers or bring Rihanna out for “Shut Up And Drive.”</p><!-- inlinecontent_2 --> <!-- end the_content -->                                <div></div>

<p>Minutes after a federal agent shot and killed a Mexican immigrant in a Chicago suburb last September, a group of police officers stood on the sidewalk trying to figure out the answer to a question of protocol: Who would investigate the shooting?</p>



<p>“Wouldn’t it be state’s, at a minimum?” one Franklin Park officer asked, according to body camera footage.</p>



<p>Chief Mike Witz shook his head. “No, because it’s a federal shooting,” he said. “You’re not going to investigate a federal officer.”</p>



<p>His officers didn’t investigate. In their report, they didn’t even note the names of the two Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at the scene of Silverio Villegas González’s death. Instead, they deferred to the FBI.</p>



<p>Local law enforcement officials also did not investigate when a Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a U.S. citizen in her car in Chicago less than a month later. Or when an ICE agent in Phoenix shot a Honduran man during a traffic stop later that month.</p>



<p>In fact, local police did not open investigations into six of the 12 shootings by on-duty federal agents that have led to the deaths or injuries of citizens and immigrants since September, a ProPublica analysis found. In three other shooting cases, state or local police said they have opened inquiries, which they called a routine practice in those jurisdictions. And in Minnesota, where ICE and Border Patrol shot and killed two U.S. citizens and injured a Venezuelan man last month, state police have tried to conduct independent investigations only to be thwarted by the Trump administration, which has gone so far as to block officers from a scene, even when they had a judicial warrant.</p>
<div>
	<div></div>
</div>



<p>In almost every instance, President Donald Trump’s administration blamed the injured and dead for the shooting within hours of the incident, raising questions about whether federal officials can fairly and objectively investigate their own. Legal experts and advocates for immigrants say this apparent lack of accountability demands that local authorities step up and exercise their power to investigate and prosecute federal agents who break state laws — from battery to murder.</p>



<p>“Local police and the state have gotten a free pass,” said Craig Futterman, a law professor at the University of Chicago and the co-founder and director of its Civil Rights and Police Accountability Project. “Residents have every right and should be demanding that, ‘Hey, state authorities, police, local police: Protect us. Arrest people who kill us, who batter us, who point guns at us and threaten and assault us without legal cause to do so.’”</p>

<p>It’s usually the opposite scenario: federal authorities coming in to investigate a troubled police department. But local authorities have investigated and <a href="https://statedemocracy.law.wisc.edu/featured/2025/explainer-state-tools-to-address-federal-corruption/">charged federal agents in the past</a>. It’s just rare and complicated. The federal supremacy clause in the U.S. Constitution bars local interference with federal law enforcement officers when they act reasonably and within the scope of their duties.</p>



<p>But given the aggressive tactics employed by immigration agents under the Trump administration, Futterman and other legal experts said local police and prosecutors are morally obligated to at least try to hold federal law enforcement officers accountable.</p>



<p>“We’re in an environment right now where ICE officers are blatantly and egregiously violating the Constitution and the law,” said Joanna Schwartz, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. “The federal government has made it very clear that they are not going to do anything to provide any sort of accountability backstop to its officers. Unfortunately, because Congress is not taking any steps to rein ICE officers in, there really is no option other than states protecting their constituents’ rights.” </p>



<p>In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said that agents are “trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and our officers.” All use-of-force incidents are properly reported and reviewed by an appropriate law enforcement agency, the spokesperson said.</p>



<p>Immigration agents at the border have <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/02/27/283455547/report-criticizes-border-patrols-use-of-force">long been criticized</a> for use of deadly force and lack of rigorous investigations afterward. But now the same militarized force is on display in major American cities far from the border, where residents are not used to their presence. </p>



<p>The shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last month — and the federal government’s resistance to a routine local investigation — has prompted Democratic and some Republican officials across the country to call for more accountability. Last week, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing police officers to document alleged illegal activity by federal immigration agents and refer any evidence of felonies to prosecutors. </p>



<p>California’s governor and attorney general issued a reminder to local police of their rights to investigate federal agents. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes launched a website asking residents to submit evidence of federal agents’ misconduct. And prosecutors from nine jurisdictions around the country announced a new coalition to provide mutual support to law enforcement authorities bringing charges against federal officers.</p>



<p>In Minneapolis, prosecutors say they’re working with state police to investigate in spite of resistance from federal officials. So far, DHS officials have refused to provide evidence or even the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/alex-pretti-shooting-cbp-agents-identified-jesus-ochoa-raymundo-gutierrez">names of the agents involved in the January shootings</a>. Prosecutors went so far as to obtain an emergency order to require that federal agencies preserve evidence in the Pretti case. A judge dropped the temporary restraining order on Monday, following assurances from the federal government that it would maintain investigative materials. </p>



<p>The prosecutors said they believe they can still gather enough evidence to make an informed decision about whether to charge the federal agents.</p>



<p>“We get cases submitted to us every day that don’t have all the evidence we would like,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said in an interview. “We would certainly like the gun. We would like the shell casings, that kind of thing. But it’s also not a mystery as to why these people died.”</p>
<div>
	<div></div>
</div>



<p>Even after getting a judicial warrant, investigators from the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension were turned away by federal agents from the Minneapolis intersection where Pretti, 37, was shot and killed. Federal officials also excluded the BCA from the investigation into the death of Renee Good, who was shot and killed in her car two weeks before Pretti. </p>



<p>BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said he’d never seen his officers physically stopped from doing their job by another law enforcement agency. Across the country, he said, state agencies like the BCA routinely investigate deadly force incidents like this one.</p>



<p>“We’re in uncharted territory here,” he said.</p>



<p>Within hours of each killing, Trump officials publicly labeled the dead “domestic terrorists.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti was “brandishing” a gun when he approached the officers, while the Border Patrol’s Gregory Bovino claimed Pretti was planning a “massacre.” </p>



<p>Video footage contradicted the administration’s version of events. Pretti, for instance, never unholstered his gun, which he was legally allowed to carry.  </p>



<p>Early last week, Trump sent Bovino and Border Patrol agents away from Minneapolis, and on Wednesday DHS officials said they would pull another 700 agents out of the state — signs  the administration may be changing its approach in response to rising criticism. The FBI is now investigating the Pretti shooting, and the Justice Department announced Friday that it had opened a civil rights investigation. </p>



<p>A DOJ spokesperson did not answer questions for this story but referred reporters to a press conference last weekend in which Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche said DHS is following its normal investigative protocols in the Pretti shooting. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Justice Department has said it has no plans to investigate Good’s shooting. </p>



<p>“We don’t just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody putting his life in danger,” Blanche told Fox News.</p>

<hr>



<p>Police in Franklin Park and Chicago have not explained why they didn’t open their own investigations into the two shootings last fall. In the Franklin Park case, the decision to let the FBI alone investigate the killing of Villegas was made within minutes of the shooting, according to dispatch records. </p>



<p>Villegas, a 38-year-old restaurant cook, was shot as he tried to drive away from ICE agents who had pulled him over. As in Minneapolis, the Trump administration’s narrative of what happened did not match the evidence. DHS claimed that Villegas dragged one of the agents, causing serious injuries. The agent fired “because he feared for his life,” officials said. Police body camera footage released after the shooting showed the agent downplaying his injury as “nothing major.”</p>



<p>At the scene, Franklin Park police officers directed traffic and interviewed a witness, the footage shows. At one point, one officer told his colleague that the police department was “just securing until they get here,” referring to the FBI.</p>

</div>



<p>Witz, who was then the police chief but has since retired, could not be reached for comment; the current chief did not respond to interview requests.</p>



<p>A similar situation unfolded in Chicago on Oct. 4 after a Border Patrol agent fired into the vehicle of a woman who federal officials claimed “ambushed” them. Marimar Martinez was charged with assaulting federal agents, though the charges were later dropped. </p>



<p>At the time, the Chicago Police Department said officers had responded to a call about a shooting “to document the incident” and to “maintain safety and traffic control.” When asked last week why it didn’t open an independent inquiry, the department directed ProPublica to its October statement, which made clear the police were “not involved in the incident or its investigation” and directed questions to federal authorities. </p>



<p>As the events in Minneapolis continued to generate criticism nationwide, Chicago’s mayor unveiled his executive order that directed officers to investigate federal immigration agents who break the law and to refer them for criminal prosecution. In a statement, the mayor’s office said the initiative was a response to “the absence of legal repercussions in the wake of the shooting of Marimar Martinez in Chicago and the killings of Silverio Villegas González in Franklin Park and Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.”</p>



<p>Legal experts said they were not aware of recent examples of Illinois law enforcement agencies investigating an on-duty federal agent, though last month a suburban police department obtained misdemeanor charges against an off-duty ICE agent accused of attacking an activist who was filming him while the agent was pumping gas. </p>



<p>Illinois State Police officials said they would investigate federal agents who were accused of breaking the law if they are asked to do so.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called on a state accountability commission to examine the roles of key Trump officials in the escalation of aggressive tactics during a monthslong immigration enforcement campaign in Chicago and its suburbs late last year. Pritzker had previously established the commission to​ gather videos and testimonies about federal agents’ conduct, and to create a public record of what happened. The commission lacks subpoena power but can refer information about potential violations of state law to law enforcement agencies or prosecutors.</p>



<p>“Just imagine if the agents who shot Mr. Villegas González back on Sept. 12 had been publicly disciplined,” Rubén Castillo, a retired federal judge who chairs the commission, said at a hearing Friday. “Maybe, just maybe, the Minnesota shootings would not have occurred, and two people would be alive who are now dead.”</p>



<p>He added: “We will have conversations with those in local law enforcement to suggest prosecutions that should be occurring even as we speak.”</p>

<hr>



<p>In California, neither the Los Angeles nor Ontario police departments investigated after two men were shot by federal immigration agents in separate October incidents and then accused of assaulting federal officers — despite video evidence and victim statements that conflicted with the accounts officials provided. A federal judge dismissed the case against one man, a Mexican immigrant and popular TikTokker; the other, a U.S. citizen, pleaded not guilty and has a trial scheduled for April.</p>



<p>Police in Phoenix also said they are not investigating the shooting of a man who federal officials say fled immigration agents last October, leaving the case to the FBI and ICE. And local police in Portland, Oregon, are not investigating an incident where federal agents shot at a Venezuelan man who had allegedly hit an unoccupied Border Patrol vehicle with his car in early January, injuring him and his passenger. The man was later charged with assaulting an officer. Unlike in some of the other cases, the Oregon attorney general’s office has opened its own investigation.</p>



<p>In contrast, police in Pima County, Arizona, and Anne Arundel County, Maryland, and the Texas Rangers have all said they opened investigations into recent shootings involving federal immigration officers.</p>
<div>
	<div></div>
</div>



<p>Asking local officials to investigate their federal counterparts does not come without challenges. Police officers and prosecutors are wary of being seen as interfering with federal law enforcement operations. They may be reluctant to damage their already complicated relationships with agencies with whom they sometimes partner. </p>



<p>Then there’s the worry about the political consequences, including the threat of losing federal funding, a dynamic that’s particularly acute under the Trump administration.</p>



<p>“This particular federal government has lobbed all kinds of threats and acted on threats against local authorities and state authorities for failure to cooperate or not do what they want them to do,” said Futterman, the University of Chicago law professor. “It’s a reason in itself not to bite a hand that feeds you.”</p>



<p>Even when local officials open their own investigations into federal agents, there’s no guarantee they can bring the cases to court. Federal agents can claim immunity in response to state charges, legal experts said, and can move their cases to federal court.</p>



<p>That immunity stems from a Supreme Court ruling more than a century ago. During the Civil Rights Movement, that immunity was used when the federal government wanted to protect its law enforcement officers tasked with enforcing then-controversial efforts like desegregation in hostile states. </p>



<p>Now local officials face the opposite challenge: protecting their constituents’ constitutional rights from what they believe is excessive force at the hands of federal officers. </p>



<p>Steve Descano, the commonwealth’s attorney for Fairfax County, Virginia, would be the first to admit that nothing about prosecuting federal agents is easy. During the first Trump administration, Descano brought state manslaughter charges against two U.S. Park Police officers who shot and killed a Virginia man. A federal judge dismissed the case in 2021 and said the officers were entitled to immunity because their actions were necessary and proper.</p>



<p>Still, Descano, who is part of the coalition of prosecutors aiming to hold federal law enforcement accountable, said he believed he and others have a responsibility to do so. </p>



<p>“If they are not willing to take these actions,” he said, “then they are cowards and they are not worthy of their positions.”</p>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt; New research published in Nature Astronomy suggests that a vast, flat sheet of dark matter explains why the Andromeda Galaxy is on a collision course with the Milky Way while other nearby galaxies are receding. The study found that this specific dark matter distribution exerts a gravitational pull that accelerates the expansion of more distant galaxies away from us—surpassing the speeds predicted by Hubble's Law—while allowing the Milky Way and Andromeda to remain gravitationally bound to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

It's mathematically described by Hubble's law, named after astronomer <a href="https://www.livescience.com/64527-edwin-hubble-universe-expanding.html"><u>Edwin Hubble</u></a>, who discovered the expansion of the universe in the 1920s. His eponymous law constrains an observational phenomenon: Galaxies are moving away from Earth at speeds that are proportional to their distance. The farther a galaxy is from our vantage point, the faster it seems to be receding.</p><p>So why is Andromeda, located <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/galaxy-next-door/"><u>2.5 million light-years away</u></a>, hurtling toward us at 68 miles per second (110 kilometers per second), while most other large, nearby galaxies are following the flow? Curiously, these receding galaxies appear to resist the immense gravitational attraction of our Local Group, which includes the Milky Way, Andromeda, the <a href="https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/star-packed-triangulum-galaxy-shines-in-new-hubble-telescope-image"><u>Triangulum Galaxy</u></a> and dozens of gravitationally bound, smaller galaxies.</p><script>

In 1959, astronomers Franz Kahn and Lodewijk Woltjer found evidence of dark matter situated around Andromeda and the Milky Way. They calculated that to reverse the initial expansion imparted by the Big Bang, these two galaxies would require a combined mass much greater <a href="https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/1138002/news20260127"><u>than all their stars put together</u></a>.</p><p>It turns out that a significant portion of the <a href="https://www.livescience.com/63410-llm-how-much-milky-way-weighs.html"><u>mass of the Milky Way</u></a> and Andromeda is contained in dark matter halos that surround each galaxy and facilitate the galaxies' rapid approach toward each other.</p><p>However, this attraction does not seem to affect nearby galaxies outside the Local Group, where "material is actually moving away from the Milky Way faster than the Hubble flow," study co-author <a href="https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~swhite/"><u>Simon White</u></a>, director emeritus of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Germany, said in a <a href="https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/1138002/news20260127"><u>statement</u></a>.</p><aside>

They ran a multitude of simulations to explore the interactions among dark matter, our Local Group, and the receding galaxies just outside it, to a distance of around 32 million light-years.</p><p>The simulations modeled the evolution of the local universe from the beginning of <a href="https://www.livescience.com/space-time.html"><u>space-time</u></a>, starting with the mass distributions observed in the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Cosmic_Microwave_Background_CMB_radiation"><u>cosmic microwave background</u></a>, the oldest light in the cosmos, emitted when the universe was just 380,000 years old. The researchers then had the model reproduce certain salient characteristics observed in nearby galaxies, including the mass, position and velocity of Andromeda and the Milky Way, as well as the positions and velocities of 31 galaxies located just outside the Local Group.</p><p>This revealed that the mass just slightly beyond the Local Group, including both <a href="https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/dark-matter"><u>dark matter</u></a> and visible matter, is distributed in a vast, flat sheet that stretches for tens of millions of light-years and continues beyond the boundaries of the simulation.</p><p>Because nearby galaxies are embedded in this flattened sheet of dark matter, any gravitational pull from our Local Group is counteracted by the gravitational pull from the more distant mass in the sheet, drawing them away from us.</p><p>"If the mass were distributed approximately spherically around the Local Group, rather than being flat, then the external galaxies would be moving away from us slower than predicted by Hubble's law for the cosmic expansion, because they would be slowed down by the gravitational pull of the Milky Way and Andromeda," White told Live Science. "Instead, the flattened distribution of the surrounding matter pulls these galaxies outwards in a way which almost exactly compensates for the inward pull of the [Milky Way] and [Andromeda]."</p><p>Equally important, the regions above and below the sheet are devoid of galaxies. Such sparse regions occur <a href="https://www.livescience.com/65928-stare-into-the-fuzzy-dark-void.html"><u>throughout the cosmos</u></a>, and the deep Local Voids around our Local Group formed in areas where the initial density of the universe was a bit lower than average.</p><p>"As a result these regions expanded faster than average, and their matter was 'pushed' outwards," White said via email. "By the present day these low-density regions fill most of space and gravitational effects have concentrated most of their material into the 'walls' that separate them."</p><a></a><h2>Reconciling experiments, observations and models</h2><p>The location of the voids is essential. These sparse regions are where any existing structures would fall toward the Local Group; any galaxies there would indeed be moving toward us. So we don't see any other objects careening toward the Milky Way, as Andromeda is doing, because there simply aren't any galaxies there to do so.</p><p>Overall, when accounting for the vast sheet of mass, the simulations accurately modeled the distribution of nearby galaxies and the voids, thereby reconciling experimental results with astronomical observations of galactic motions as well as with the leading model of cosmology, known as <a href="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/100-undiscovered-galaxies-may-be-orbiting-the-milky-way-supercomputer-simulations-hint"><u>lambda cold dark matter</u></a>.</p><div><div>related stories</div><div><p>—<a href="https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/dark-matter/giant-rogue-waves-of-invisible-matter-might-be-disrupting-the-orbits-of-stars-new-study-hints">Giant 'rogue waves' of invisible matter might be disrupting the orbits of stars, new study hints</a></p><p>—<a href="https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/dark-matter/ghostly-galaxy-without-dark-matter-baffles-astronomers">Ghostly galaxy without dark matter baffles astronomers</a></p><p>—<a href="https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/dark-matter/heavy-dark-matter-would-rip-our-understanding-of-the-universe-apart-new-research-suggests">'Heavy' dark matter would rip our understanding of the universe apart, new research suggests</a></p></div></div><p>"We are exploring all possible local configurations of the early universe that ultimately could lead to the Local Group," lead study author <a href="https://ewoudwempe.com"><u>Ewoud Wempe</u></a>, a cosmologist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, said in a <a href="https://www.rug.nl/fse/news/matter-and-space/a-large-scale-sheet-surrounding-of-the-milky-way-explains-the-motion-of-nearby-galaxies?lang=en"><u>different statement</u></a>. "It is great that we now have a model that is consistent with the current cosmological model on the one hand, and with the dynamics of our local environment on the other."</p><p>Interestingly, the researchers report that high-latitude galaxies farther out in the cosmos have been observed to be falling toward the flat sheet of matter at several hundred kilometers per hour. Finding additional structures infalling from the directions of the voids could lend further support to the results of this study.</p><div>

        <div><p>Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story: </p><ul><li>A retired volunteer unearthed a rare 1,000-year-old Pictish ring during excavations in Scotland.</li><li>The ring is one of the few Pictish rings ever discovered and offers insights into the Pictish kingdom’s history.</li><li>The find sheds light on the Picts, a powerful group who defended Scotland from invaders and mysteriously vanished by the end of the first millennium.</li></ul><hr><p>A “remarkable” ring dating back at least a millennium was unearthed near the <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a19673603/dino-footprints-scotland/">Scottish shore</a>. And it wasn’t some seasoned archeologist who made the find, but rather, a self-described “enthusiastic volunteer” who uncovered this <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a65187570/northern-lights-make-noise/">ancient</a> piece of jewelry.<br></p><p>John Ralph, a 68-year-old former engineer, had started out simply looking to make use of his free time. “I had recently retired and saw a post looking for volunteers to help with the Burghead excavations,” he told <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vx2nvk6kgo"><em>BBC Scotland</em></a>, “My sister still lives in Burghead and it sounded interesting so I thought why not. I have now joined three different <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/adventure/outdoors/a42953312/jesse-jamess-lost-gold/">digs</a> there, each for two weeks.”</p><section></section><p>The excavated area is thought to have been a settlement that served as “a significant seat of power” during the Pictish kingdom between 500 and 1000 CE. At first, Ralph felt he was making remarkable discovery after remarkable discovery, only to be told by the attending experts that he’d merely found some glistening <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/a64700460/only-alcatraz-prison-break/">rocks</a>.</p><section><aside><h6><span></span><span>Related Story</span><span></span></h6><ul><li><a href="/culture/a69958310/global-sand-shortage-mafia/"><span></span><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/5704e986-96db-4322-a7db-4be6d5b67815.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.332xh&amp;resize=300:*" alt title="global-sand-shortage-mafia"><span>The World Is Running Out of Sand</span><span></span></a></li></ul></aside></section><p>“I thoroughly enjoyed them all but my initial enthusiasm for finds was somewhat dented by my knack of getting excited for shiny pebbles,” Ralph summarized, “I had found a few interesting items including bone pins and it was great being part of the team, which was the real draw.”</p><p>But that changed when Ralph was simply cleaning the floor of a structure. He first spotted a metal pin, and then “lo and behold, there was the ring.”</p><section><div><section><div><div><img src="/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=currentColor&amp;id=link-out-embed" alt="instagram"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_fbwB1q3nk/">View full post on Instagram</a></div></div></section></div></section><p>“John was digging and then came over and said ‘look what I’ve found,’” Gordon Noble, Professor of Archaeology at the University of Aberdeen told BBC Scotland. Noble, who has led the excavation work over the last three years, felt what Ralph had stumbled upon was “truly incredible,” noting that, “we could see it was something really exciting as despite more than 1,000 years in the ground we could see glints of the possible garnet setting.”</p><p>This surprising discovery was made all the more remarkable, Noble added, because, “there are very few Pictish rings which have ever been discovered and those we do know about usually come from hoards which were placed in the ground deliberately for safekeeping in some way.”</p><section><aside><h6><span></span><span>Related Story</span><span></span></h6><ul><li><a href="/adventure/a36082822/the-real-story-of-the-oak-island-money-pit/"><span></span><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/oak-island-brandon-ko-thc-1619118290.jpg?crop=1xw:0.8152173913043478xh;center,top&amp;resize=300:*" alt title="Scene from the show The Curse of Oak Island on The History Channel"><span>The Real Story of Oak Island’s Legendary Money Pit</span><span></span></a></li></ul></aside></section><p>The Picts, called Picti by the <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a64051065/excavation-changes-roman-empire-history/">Romans</a> from the Latin for “Painted Ones,” were northern tribes who made up the largest kingdom in Dark Age <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a25266/archaeological-find-scotland/">Scotland</a>, per <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/kingdom_of_the_picts/">the BBC</a>. Noteworthy warriors, the Picts held back invasion attempts by not just the Romans, but also the Angles, the latter during the famous Battle of Dun Nechtain.</p><p>“If the Picts had lost,” the BBC wrote of the ferocious fight against the Northumbrian Angle invaders, “Scotland might never have existed.” However, in spite of their military might, the Picts would “disappear from history by the end of the first millennium,” with the BBC noting that they were “swallowed whole by the history of another group, the Gaels.”</p><p>So this ring, stumbled upon by a volunteer with a knack for finding “shiny pebbles,” not only offers a connection to a crucial group of people in Scotland’s history, but it might also provide a greater understanding of a kingdom who “disappeared from history.” The ring is currently at the National Museum of Scotland for analysis.</p><div><div><div><h2><span></span>Our Most-Read Stories of the Year<span></span></h2><div><button><img src="/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-left-regular.dc4f48a.svg?primary=%2523D4D4D4" alt="Chevron Left Icon"></button><button><img src="/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right-regular.e879c19.svg?primary=%2523fff" alt="Chevron Right Icon"></button></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/popspecialstories01-691b7fa11276b.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=640:*" alt="a hidden state exists between life and death" title="a hidden state exists between life and death"><h6></h6><div><p><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a63917106/cells-conscious-xenobots/">Find Answers </a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/popspecialstories03-691b8036b56a4.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=640:*" alt="gravity may prove the universe is a simulation" title="gravity may prove the universe is a simulation"><h6></h6><div><p><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a64855171/universe-is-a-simulation-gravity/">Get The Facts </a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/popspecialstories06-691b8094975f4.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=640:*" alt="scientists found a computer older than history" title="scientists found a computer older than history"><h6></h6><div><p><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a63683503/antikythera-mechanism/">Learn The Truth</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/popspecialstories04-691b800d2a3ff.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=640:*" alt="admiral warns of intelligence hiding underwater" title="admiral warns of intelligence hiding underwater"><h6></h6><div><p><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a64073070/ufos-hiding-underwater/">What Are They? </a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/popspecialstories02-691b7fd9781c3.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=640:*" alt="build a smokeless fire pit at home" title="build a smokeless fire pit at home"><h6></h6><div><p><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/outdoor-projects/a39852727/diy-smokeless-fire-pit/">Start Your Build</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/popspecialstories05-691b8069d24bd.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=640:*" alt="you can develop a real life sixth sense" title="you can develop a real life sixth sense"><h6></h6><div><p><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a64855171/universe-is-a-simulation-gravity/">Transform Your Perception</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><span><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a0a518c7-4b7c-4fec-af85-d82b1326dcac_1746820427.file?fill=1:1&amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Michael Natale" title="Headshot of Michael Natale"></span><div><span><a href="/author/231777/michael-natale/"><span>Michael Natale</span></a></span><div>News Editor</div></div><div><div><p>Michale Natale is a News Editor for the Hearst Enthusiast Group.

        <div><p>Downie, who served as executive editor from 1991 to 2008, contrasted the paths of the <em>Times</em> and the <em>Post</em>. During the past decade, the <em>Times</em> transformed itself into a one-stop-shopping environment that lured readers with games such as Spelling Bee, a cooking app, and a shopping guide. By the end of 2025, it was reporting close to thirteen million digital subscribers and an operating profit of more than a hundred and ninety-two million dollars. The <em>Post</em> does not release information about its digital subscribers, but it was reported to have two and a half million digital subscribers at the time of the non-endorsement decision, in 2024.</p><p>“One of the big differences to me was that they hired a publisher”—Ryan—“who didn’t come up with any ideas,” Downie told me. “And then when he left . . . we knew that Bezos was losing money, and we were encouraged by the fact that they were looking for somebody who could improve the business side of the paper and the circulation side of the paper. And then they chose this guy who we hardly ever heard from, who had a checkered past in British journalism.”</p><p>Writing last month on a private Listserv for former <em>Post</em> employees, Paul Farhi, who as the media reporter for the <em>Post</em> covered Bezos’s acquisition of the paper, shared his “utter mystification and bafflement” about Bezos’s tolerance of Lewis. “Even as a hands-off boss,” he wondered, “could Bezos not see what was obvious to even casual observers within a few months of Will’s arrival—that Will was ill-suited to the Post, that he had alienated the newsroom, that he had an ethically suspect past, and—most important—that none of his big ideas was working or even being implemented?” (Farhi, who took a buyout in 2023, gave me permission to quote his message.)</p><p>Even before these new cuts, a parade of key staffers had left the <em>Post</em>. A beloved managing editor, Matea Gold, went to the <em>Times</em>. The national editor, Philip Rucker, decamped to CNN, and the political reporter Josh Dawsey to the <em>Wall Street</em> <em>Journal</em>. The <em>Atlantic</em> hired, among others, three stars of the paper’s White House team: Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, and Toluse Olorunnipa. These are losses that would take years to rebuild—if the <em>Post</em> were in a rebuilding mode. The <em>Post</em>, Woodward said, “lives and is doing an extraordinary reporting job on the political crisis that is Donald Trump”—including its scoop on the second strike to kill survivors of an attack on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat. But the print edition is a shadow of its former self, with metro, style, and sports melded into an anemic second section; daily print circulation is now below one hundred thousand. More pressingly, it’s unclear whether a newsroom so stripped of resources can sustain the quality of its work.</p><p>The sports columnist Sally Jenkins, who left the <em>Post</em> in August, 2025, as part of the second wave of buyouts, has been more supportive of management than many other <em>Post</em> veterans. So it was striking that, when we spoke recently, she was both passionate about the work of her newsroom colleagues and unsparing about how the business side had failed them. “When you whack at these sections, you’re whacking at the roots of the tree,” she told me. “We train great journalists in every section of the paper, and we train them to cover every subject on the globe. And when you whack whole sections of people away, you are really, really in danger of killing the whole tree.” When I asked how she felt about the losses, Jenkins said, “My heart is cracked in about five different pieces.”</p></div>

<p>Little kids hosting make-believe tea parties is a fixture of childhood playtime and long presumed to be exclusively a human ability. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University presented evidence in a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adz0743">new paper</a> published in the journal Science that a bonobo named Kanzi was also able to participate in pretending to hold a tea party. For the authors, this suggests that apes are capable of using their imagination just like human toddlers.</p>
<p>“It really is game-changing that their mental lives go beyond the here and now,” said co-author Christopher Krupenye. “Imagination has long been seen as a critical element of what it is to be human, but the idea that it may not be exclusive to our species is really transformative. Jane Goodall discovered that chimps make tools, and that led to a change in the definition of what it means to be human, and this, too, really invites us to reconsider what makes us special and what mental life is out there among other creatures.”</p>
<p>Per Krupenye et al., by the age of two, human children are able to navigate imaginary scenarios like a tea party, pretending there is real tea present even if the teapot and cups are actually empty. Cognitively speaking, it’s an example of secondary representation, because it involves decoupling an imagined or simulated state (pretending there is actual tea in the cup) with the reality (the cup is empty).</p>
<p>Scientists have long pondered whether other animals, notably primates, also possess such mental capacities. There is some anecdotal evidence for this. For instance, a young chimpanzee <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10329-020-00836-z">was observed</a> dragging imaginary blocks across the floor, just as the chimp did with real wooden blocks. Some female chimps in the wild will carry and play with sticks, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982210014491">treating them as infants</a>—a rudimentary form of playing with a doll. And a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0885201406000451">2006 study</a> found that chimps and bonobos that had been exposed to human culture would sometimes perform pretend actions, like holding a bowl to a doll’s mouth to feed it, in response to verbal prompts.</p>

On paper, it’s a close matchup—but our staff has a clear favorite. Who will come out on top on Sunday?</em></p><h2>24-16, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP: </strong>Jaxon Smith-Njigba<br><strong>Unlikely hero: </strong>DeMarcus Lawrence</p><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/sheil-kapadia"><strong>Sheil Kapadia:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I think there are two ways that the Patriots <em>could </em>win: One, Drake Maye puts the team on his back (possible!). Two, Sam Darnold turns into a pumpkin (also possible!). But I think that the Seahawks are the better team on a down-to-down basis. I think that their defensive front will control the game against New England's shaky offensive line, and I give Mike Macdonald a big edge over Josh McDaniels from a coaching perspective. On the other side of the ball, the Patriots like to play a lot of man coverage, and Smith-Njigba destroys man coverage. I see a competitive game, with the Seahawks doing just enough offensively to be crowned champs.</p><h2>27-21, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP: </strong>Sam Darnold<br><strong>Unlikely hero: </strong>Sam Darnold</p><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/nora-princiotti"><strong>Nora Princiotti:</strong></a><strong> </strong>OK, so “unlikely” might be too cute, or require a season-long mindset. But come on. There’s no more unlikely hero than Darnold, who before this season was best known for experiencing paranormal activity on the football field and having mononucleosis that one time. In theory, Darnold doesn’t have to make that many big plays for the Seahawks to carry this one, thanks to their defense, but stylistically, he’s a boom-or-bust guy. That Darnold would become the first quarterback from the class of 2018 to start in the Super Bowl seemed <em>extremely </em>unlikely not long ago, and even a moment or two of heroism in a Seattle win on Sunday would cap one of the most shocking player turnaround stories in NFL history.</p><h2>16-10, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP: </strong>Jaxon Smith-Njigba<br><strong>Unlikely hero:</strong> Michael Dickson</p><div></div><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/danny-kelly"><strong>Danny Kelly:</strong></a><strong> </strong>It feels like this is going to be a low-scoring, knock-down, drag-out battle between two really good defenses. The Seahawks’ fearsome defensive front will make life hard for the Patriots offensive line, shutting down the run while getting after Drake Maye for most of the game. On the other side of the coin, I could see New England’s defense giving Seattle’s offense fits, too. That will turn this game into a competition of who can take care of the ball and win the field-position battle. Seattle’s steely punter, Michael Dickson, will do his part to pin the Pats deep in their own end. And while it won’t always be pretty, I think Sam Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and Co. will be able to do just enough to pull away with the victory. </p><div><div></div><p>Previewing Super Bowl LX<!-- --> </p><div><div><button>Articles</button><button>Podcasts</button></div><div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div></div><p>Previewing Super Bowl LX<!-- --> </p><div><div><button>Articles</button><button>Podcasts</button></div><div></div><div></div></div></div><h2>24-20, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP: </strong>DeMarcus Lawrence<br><strong>Unlikely hero:</strong> AJ Barner</p><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/steven-ruiz"><strong>Steven Ruiz:</strong></a><strong> </strong>This isn't a terrible matchup for the Patriots, but the talent gap is just too wide for me to back them. A few Sam Darnold turnovers will be required to keep things close, which is certainly in the range of realistic outcomes. But the Seahawks quarterback will have a wide margin for error on Sunday thanks to his defense, which can overwhelm a leaky New England offensive line and make Drake Maye’s Super Bowl debut a miserable experience. I’ve got DeMarcus Lawrence getting a fourth-quarter strip sack to put the game away. And even if Seattle’s offense turns in a chaotic performance, it’s too explosive to hold down for a full 60-minute game and should score enough points to win. New England will be ready for the downfield shots to Jaxon Smith-Njigba, which could open up space underneath for tight end AJ Barner to have a busy night. Eventually, though, JSN will strike and put the Pats away.</p><h2>34-14, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP: </strong>Sam Darnold<br><strong>Unlikely hero:</strong> Ernest Jones IV</p><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/diante-lee"><strong>Diante Lee:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I’ve tried to couch all my takes on Super Bowl LX with the tired “Anything can happen” nonsense. But I’m dropping the niceties after rewatching the film. Seattle is faster, is deeper in the trenches, and has more avenues to win than New England does. We just haven’t seen the Patriots play a team as good as Seattle. And it feels wrong to say, but I think I trust quarterback Sam Darnold to protect the ball more than Drake Maye, given how this postseason has played out. Don’t be shocked if this game gets out of hand pretty quickly.</p><h2>31-9, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP:</strong> Sam Darnold<br><strong>Unlikely hero: </strong>Ernest Jones IV</p><div></div><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/danny-heifetz"><strong>Danny Heifetz:</strong></a><strong> </strong>New England's offense is good. Seattle's defense is historic. New England is trotting out a rookie left tackle and a rookie left guard versus the best and most sophisticated defense in years. For all the fears that Darnold will make a dumb turnover (or three), people have forgotten that Maye had more combined picks and fumbles in the Patriots-Texans game than C.J. Stroud did. Steel yourself to see Darnold holding the Lombardi Trophy.</p><h2>28-17, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP:</strong> Sam Darnold<br><strong>Unlikely hero: </strong>Ernest Jones IV</p><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/lindsay-jones"><strong>Lindsay Jones:</strong></a> I will not let how weird the words "Sam Darnold, Super Bowl champion" sound inside my brain cause me to overthink this: Seattle has been one of the best teams all season. Its success, including Darnold’s, is not a fluke. And while it very much seems like this is the start of a great new era for the Patriots, this is Seattle's time. </p><h2>23-14, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP: </strong>Sam Darnold<br><strong>Unlikely hero: </strong>Sam Darnold</p><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/austin-gayle"><strong>Austin Gayle:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Darnold is an unlikely hero! A year ago, all he was known for was shitting his pants in big games, taking bad sacks, and making worse turnovers. Two years ago, he was a backup in San Francisco. Before that, he was a failed reclamation experiment in Carolina and an all-time draft bust for the Jets. You’d have to go all the way back to the ’80s and Jim Plunkett, a former no. 1 pick, to find a draft bust turned Super Bowl–winning quarterback. (You could count former no. 9 pick Trent Dilfer and his win with the Ravens in 2000, but he was more of a disappointment for Tampa Bay than a bust.) Darnold will join rare company if he pulls it off on Sunday, and he doesn’t need to be a superhero to make it happen. Smith-Njigba and Kenneth Walker III are game-wrecking skill players, and the Seattle defense is arguably the best the NFL has seen in the past five years. The moment just can’t be too big for Darnold. The ghosts of his past can’t creep back in. If he avoids game-altering mistakes, he will complete one of the biggest career turnarounds in NFL history. </p><h2>24-20, Seahawks </h2><p><strong>MVP: </strong>Sam Darnold <br><strong>Unlikely hero:</strong> Rashid Shaheed</p><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/riley-mcatee"><strong>Riley McAtee:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Seattle is the better team, although it's close. The main matchup I am looking at is how Smith-Njigba fares against Christian Gonzalez and New England’s secondary—and as good as Gonzalez is, I think that the advantage lies firmly with the Offensive Player of the Year. Both quarterbacks in this matchup face tough tests, but Darnold has arguably the best playmaker in the league—and New England’s defense, while quite good, isn’t on the level of Seattle’s. The Seahawks can make Darnold’s job a bit easier than the Patriots can Maye’s, and I think that difference in supporting casts will prove to be the key factor. Darnold will officially exorcise the "seeing ghosts" demons on the biggest stage.</p><h2>24-16, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP: </strong>Jaxon Smith-Njigba<br><strong>Unlikely hero: </strong>Nick Emmanwori</p><div></div><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/anthony-dabbundo"><strong>Anthony Dabbundo:</strong></a><strong> </strong>New England's offense has struggled in all three of its playoff games against top-tier AFC defenses, and I don't expect the Super Bowl to go much differently against another elite defense. Maye has taken 15 sacks and fumbled five times under pressure throughout January, and I know that Macdonald has spent every waking moment scheming up ways to pressure him on Sunday. The Seahawks will get redemption for their failed <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2025/02/05/nfl/malcolm-butler-interception-new-england-patriots-super-bowl-benching">goal-line sequence</a> 11 years ago and will become one of the unlikeliest NFL champions (by preseason expectations) of the 21st century.</p><div><div><div><div></div><div><a href="/creator/the-ringer-staff"><img alt="" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F02%2FRingerStaff.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=a8b73fcf73f629560bb508a5483df024a46b0236"></a></div><div></div></div><div><a href="/creator/the-ringer-staff"><div>The Ringer Staff</div><div><div>The Ringer Staff</div></div></a><span></span></div></div></div></article>

	President <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> went on a wild social media posting spree late Thursday night and into this morning, one that included a video depicting Barack and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/michelle-obama/">Michelle Obama</a> as apes, set to “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”</p>



<p>
	The clip of the Obamas, which appears to be AI-generated, comes near the end of a 62-second video about election conspiracy theories. Trump posted the video just before midnight on Thursday. The post was taken down late this morning amid bipartisan backlash.</p>



<p>
	The White House initially defended the post. “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from <em>The Lion King</em>,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a statement. “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”</p>



<p>
	The White House <a href="https://x.com/alaynatreene/status/2019816430834000181/history">told CNN</a> later this morning, however, that the post was made “erroneously” by a staffer, and that the post has been removed from Trump’s Truth Social feed.

<p>
	The video is the latest entry in the right’s long history of racism directed at the Obamas. Trump ahead of the 2012 presidential election famously pushed the “birther” conspiracy theory that <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a> was actually born in Africa and not a U.S. citizen. “An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that @BarackObama’s birth certificate is a fraud,” he tweeted that year. Obama had already released his long-form birth certificate to throw cold water on the conspiracy theory a year prior.</p>



<p>
	Democrats were quick today to condemn the post depicting the Obamas as apes. </p>



<p>
	“Disgusting behavior by the President,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s press office <a href="https://x.com/GovPressOffice/status/2019658680933999090">wrote</a> shortly after Trump posted the clip. “Every single Republican must denounce this. Now.”</p>



<p>
	“Trump is a vile racist old man. The people in the <a href="https://x.com/HouseGOP">@HouseGOP</a> that don’t speak out on this, I’m going to assume you support this racism,” <a href="https://x.com/RepHerbConaway/status/2019762335842279777">wrote</a> Rep. Herb Conaway (D-N.J.), who is Black.

	“Let it haunt Trump and his racist followers that future Americans will embrace the Obamas as beloved figures while studying him as a stain on our history,” Ben Rhodes, a national security adviser under Obama, <a href="https://x.com/brhodes/status/2019674836189213095">posted</a> on X.

<p>
	The NAACP also weighed in. “Donald Trump’s racist video is disgusting and utterly despicable,” the organization wrote in a statement. “Trump is obviously desperate to distract us from the Epstein files and his rapidly failing economy. You know who isn’t in the Epstein files? Barack Obama.”</p>



<p>
	Some on the right seemed to recognize that Trump posting the video was not a good look. “FAKE NEWS ALERT! Trump Didn’t post this monkey video of the obamas. Lying Democrats. It’s not on his page. Fake screenshot,” <a href="https://x.com/w_terrence/status/2019684079894171988">wrote</a> MAGA influencer Terrence K. Williams to his 2.4 million X followers. Williams was quickly corrected by fact-checkers and a community note was soon attached to his post, which has not been deleted as of this morning.

	Multiple Republican lawmakers — including Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who is Black, and Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) — called for Trump to remove the post. Scott, a close ally of the president, <a href="https://x.com/votetimscott/status/2019784005852242083">described the video</a> as the “most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House.”</p>



<p>
	The video featuring the Obamas was part of a bizarre string of posts from the president, many of which promoted unfounded election conspiracy theories. Trump also shared a 14-second <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116021666129349884">video</a> of a dog sliding itself into a kitchen at the sound of an aerosol whipped-cream can, and a 15-second <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116021671379958455">video</a> of Bruce Lee set to a dramatic rendition of the “Seven Nation Army” melody.</p>

<p>SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — Katie Paris opened a “Unite for Springfield” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Acos_KrMJfQ">Zoom gathering of more than 4,000 people</a> earlier this week by asking participants to share one thing in the chat that was giving them hope. </p>



<p>“Times are heavy. The subject we are discussing tonight is heavy. We’re in a heavy moment. It is so important in these times to tap into a sense of hope,” the mother of two said, sitting in front of a colorful wall displaying her children’s artwork. </p>



<p>“One thing that’s giving you hope right now, okay, let’s turn on the chat. Let’s see them,” Paris prompted.</p>

<p>“My children.” <br>“Minnesotans.”<br>“Community.” <br>“Family.” <br>“Decency.” <br>“Grandchildren.” <br>“<a href="https://19thnews.org/2026/01/minneapolis-protesters-rally-ice-schools-children/">Liam Ramos</a>.”</p>



<p>Red Wine &amp; Blue, an organization that Paris founded in 2019 to build a diverse “sisterhood” of suburban women to fight political extremism, hosted the call just hours before Tuesday night’s slated expiration of Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, an immigration designation that has allowed some 350,000 Haitians to live and work legally in the country. Springfield, a central Ohio city of 60,000 where as many as one in four residents are Haitian, was <a href="https://19thnews.org/2026/01/ice-churches-children-springfield-ohio/">bracing for an influx of federal immigration enforcement officers</a> akin to the Trump administration’s violent crackdown in Minnesota. Paris, who lives outside of Cleveland, about a three-hour drive northeast of Springfield, tempered the hopeful tone at the start of the meeting with political reality. </p>



<p>“Last night, a <a href="https://19thnews.org/2026/01/ice-churches-children-springfield-ohio/">federal judge blocked the Trump administration</a> from ending Temporary Protected Status for Haitians living and working legally in America, and the fight is far from over. The Department of Homeland Security immediately stated that they are <a href="https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/2018502877321334812">taking the case to the U.S. Supreme Court</a>, and we know what that means: With this Supreme Court, Haitians could lose their status in really a matter of weeks,” Paris said. </p>



<p>“We’re going to talk about what’s next legally in all this, we’re going to talk about what we can learn from Minneapolis, and we’re also going to talk about how we can stay safe. Finally, perhaps most importantly of all, we are going to be giving you opportunities to take real action tonight,” she continued.</p>



<p><a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/06/older-women-front-and-center-in-no-kings-pro-democracy-movement/">Women have been leading</a> <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/11/ohio-women-trump-remove-the-regime-protest/">the opposition</a> to <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/10/kendra-sullivan-no-kings-protest-rural-west-virginia/">Donald Trump’s second presidency</a>, playing key roles in resistance efforts and <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/08/free-dc-women-founded-movement-trump-military-takeover/">forming groups to counter</a> the administration’s policies on immigration and more. During the 2024 campaign, Trump repeatedly targeted the Haitians in Springfield with lies — as did now Vice President JD Vance, an Ohioan — to bolster his calls for a crackdown on even legal immigration. The president said he would “protect” women from immigrants, “<a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/10/trump-rally-protector-women/">whether the women like it or not</a>,” despite polls showing that women did not rank immigration among their top concerns, <a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/11/abortion-election-roe-harris-trump/">nor did they trust Trump the most</a> on the issue. </p>



<p>A PBS News/NPR/Marist Poll released Thursday showed that <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/poll-nearly-two-thirds-of-americans-say-ice-has-gone-too-far-in-immigration-crackdown">nearly two-thirds of Americans</a> now believe Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, has gone too far in its methods after federal agents killed Renee Nicole Good and <a href="https://19thnews.org/2026/01/alex-pretti-minneapolis-ice-shooting/">Alex Pretti</a> in Minneapolis. When <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NPR_PBS-News_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_202602021147.pdf">broken down by gender</a>, just 26 percent of women said they approved of how ICE was doing compared to 40 percent of men, the poll showed.</p>



<p>Paris, who <a href="https://www.leapambassadors.org/ambassadors/paris/">worked in national politics</a> before moving back to her husband’s hometown from Washington, D.C., founded Red Wine &amp; Blue to harness the political power of suburban women, a rapidly diversifying group that determines the outcome of elections — and often votes with different priorities on their minds than men do. </p>

<p>“It was really my reaction to the 2018 election and seeing all these women, particularly in the suburbs, become involved in politics for the very first time as a result of the 2016 election,” she said in an interview after the organizing call. “I knew that we needed to keep them engaged, and women are not always taken as seriously as I believe they should be.”</p>



<p>The Ohio chapter was Red Wine &amp; Blue’s first, followed by chapters in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Michigan — all critical states in presidential elections. There is also a national network of “Trouble Nation” groups for women living outside of those four states. Red Wine &amp; Blue now has more than 600,000 members and a staff of about 60. Its members and affiliated groups held 4,000 events last year, most of them in person. </p>

<p>The opportunity for action during Tuesday night’s Zoom came in a series of requests for donations for Springfield groups supporting Haitian families. Participants heard from <a href="https://19thnews.org/2026/01/ice-churches-children-springfield-ohio/">local pastor Carl Ruby</a>, whose congregation includes Haitians and is vocal about supporting them; Catholic <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/12/springfield-ohio-haitian-family-separation/">charity leader Casey Rollins,</a> who has urged Haitian parents to get passports and documents for their U.S.-born children in case of deportation or separation; Viles Dorsainvil, director of the nonprofit Haitian Community Help and Support Center; and legal experts who advised them on their rights and precautions to take when documenting ICE activity. Minneapolis-based Rev. Ashley Horan also joined to talk  about how her community <a href="https://19thnews.org/2026/02/minnesota-mutual-aid-caregiving-ice-resistance/">stepped up to care for their immigrant neighbors</a>. </p>



<p>In between speakers, Paris reminded those on the call — the vast majority were women and many were Ohioans, or had connections to Ohio or to Haiti, or a mix of those — that the way to help this time was to give money, and to do it fast. “We’re not going to keep this donate page up for long because we do need to get these funds in the hands of these organizations quickly — they are providing such urgently needed services on the ground,” she said. </p>



<p>The chat lit up again as the participants donated as little as $10 and as much as a $10,000 match.</p>



<p>“Donated.”<br>“Donated.”<br>“Donated again.”</p>



<p>In less than an hour, Red Wine &amp; Blue surpassed its fundraising target for the evening, collecting more than $107,000 for local groups supporting Springfield’s Haitian residents.</p>



<p>Red Wine &amp; Blue focuses on what Paris describes as “friend-to-friend” organizing; it does not spend money on expensive television ad campaigns or anonymous phone-banking efforts. Third-party analysis that matched Red Wine &amp; Blue’s contacts to voter files showed that their on-the-ground organizing increased turnout by 5 percent in even years and 8 to 11 percent in odd years. Paris said that a recent membership analysis showed that 54 percent of their members are current or former political independents or Republicans. </p>



<p>She gave the group its name — no wine consumption is required for membership, by the way — because she is “all about leaning into the tropes” that are put on women to “regain our political power.”</p>



<p>“They called us the ‘suburban housewives’ in 2020. We’ve been the ‘Chardonnay Antifa.’ Now they’re saying the ‘wine moms’ are paid protesters. We’ve been ‘soccer moms’ and ‘Zoom moms.’ I think <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTk4XYNDUYW/">all of that is meant to reduce us</a>, as a group of women who actually do have political power,” Paris said. </p>



<p>After a Fox News columnist <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-impeding-federal-law-enforcement-not-protest-its-just-crime">wrote last month</a> that “organized gangs of wine moms” were using “Antifa tactics” to oppose ICE, Red Wine &amp; Blue fired back on social media: “Add it to the very long list of names they’ve called us. They can try to scare us, they can try to shame us… but we’re still showing up, still supporting our communities.”</p>



<p>After the Zoom call, Paris said, “People are already getting their protest signs ready for the next ‘No Kings’ Day, saying: Red Wine &amp; Blue, the original ‘wine moms.’”</p>

        <div>
    <p>Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver turns 50 this month. Nominated for four Oscars and winner of the Palme d’Or at the 1976 Cannes Festival, Scorsese’s searing, hallucinatory portrait of urban alienation is <a href="https://www.afi.com/afis-100-years-100-movies-10th-anniversary-edition/">widely regarded</a> as one of the most important American films of all time. </p>

<p>It is also unquestionably one of the most troubling.</p>

<p>Taxi Driver channels the anger, paranoia and alienation of an American decade shaped by economic decline, imperialist violence and political scandal. Set in the dilapidated squalor of a rapidly <a href="https://jacobin.com/2018/01/new-york-gentrification-real-estate-deindustrialization">deindustrialising</a> New York, the film proffers a forlorn portrait of a society coming apart at the seams. </p>

<p>At its heart sits a deeply unsettling vision of masculinity, bound up in racism and misogyny.</p>

<p>The social and psychological forces Taxi Driver brought into focus have not disappeared. If anything, they have simply migrated – finding new expression in digital cultures shaped by the <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-the-word-incel-got-away-from-us-255109">platforming of grievance</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/opinion/right-wing-masculinity-culture.html">aesthetised resentment</a> and the <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/celebrity/article/andrew-tate-toxic-masculinity-money-wealth-kshgkwb36">monetisation of male rage</a>. </p>

<h2>American existentialism</h2>

<p>Travis Bickle (portrayed with unnerving intensity by Robert De Niro) was the creation of screenwriter Paul Schrader, who drew heavily on his own experiences of isolation and emotional crisis. Schrader also looked to literature for inspiration, citing Fyodor Dostoevsky’s misanthropic <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49455.Notes_from_Underground">Underground Man</a> as a formative influence. </p><div>
<div>
  <h5></h5>
  <button></button>
</div>
</div>

<p>In placing the European existential hero in an American context, <a href="https://www.filmcomment.com/article/paul-schrader-richard-thompson-interview/">said Schrader</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you find that he becomes more ignorant, ignorant of the nature of his problem. Travis’ problem is the same as the existential hero’s, that is, should I exist? But Travis doesn’t understand that this is his problem, so he focuses it elsewhere: and I think that is a mark of the immaturity and the youngness of our country. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Schrader also drew on contemporary events, including the attempted assassination of right-wing politician <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-C-Wallace">George Wallace</a> by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Assassinations-and-assassination-attempts-involving-U-S-presidents-and-presidential-candidates">Arthur Bremer</a>. The result was a character who crystallised the violent confusions of the era.</p>

<p>Like Bremer, Travis keeps a diary. We see him writing in it at various points in the film and we hear excerpts from it in voiceover:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the animals come out at night. Whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal. Someday a real rain’ll come and wash all this scum off the streets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Travis, a decidedly unreliable narrator who claims to have served in Vietnam, takes a job as a taxi driver because he has trouble sleeping. Working almost exclusively at night and wound impossibly tight, he rides through the city in a state of heightened unease. </p>

<p>One morning, after clocking off from a long shift, he notices a young woman through the window of a midtown Manhattan office. This is Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), an ambitious campaign worker employed by a presidential hopeful Charles Palentine (Leonard Harris). </p>

<p>Betsy quickly becomes the object of Travis’s fixation. He begins loitering in his cab outside her workplace, watching her from a distance. Eventually, he somehow persuades her to go on a date with him. It does not go well. </p>

<p>Socially inept, Travis’ idea of a good time is a trip to a Times Square porno theatre. He appears genuinely baffled when Betsy decides she has had enough and storms out, cutting off all contact with him. This only deepens Travis’ indignation and culminates in an angry confrontation at Betsy’s office, where he berates her in front of her coworkers.</p>

<p>Travis starts to spiral, confessing to a fellow cabbie that he’s got “some bad ideas” in his head. He settles on a plan of action. His diary entries become even more ominous.</p>

<p>He starts working out obsessively, loads up on guns and plots the public assassination of Betsy’s boss. Political violence becomes a way of giving shape to his discontent, transforming indignation into a pipe dream of historical consequence. He practices shooting in front of the mirror in his dingy apartment. </p>

          </figure>

<p>De Niro’s improvised line, “You talkin’ to me”, became (to borrow from film scholar <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28408.Taxi_Driver">Amy Taubin</a>) “arguably the most quoted scene in movie history”. </p>

<p>When his plan to murder Palantine collapses, Travis redirects his attention to Iris, a 12-year-old sex worker played by Jodie Foster. He decides he must “help” her get away from her pimp, believing himself morally just. Carnage ensues – so ferocious that it <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/martin-scorsese-taxi-driver-apple-tv-b2839879.html">initially led</a> to the film being refused a commercial rating.</p>

<p>It ends on a bleakly ironic, ambiguous note.</p>

<h2>A dark afterlife</h2>

<p>Taxi Driver <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1976/02/09/taxi-driver-movie-review-pauline-kael">divided</a> <a href="https://www.filmcomment.com/article/the-power-the-gory-martin-scorsese-taxi-driver-manny-farber-patricia-patterson/">critics</a> but proved an immediate hit with viewers. </p>

<p>Its disquieting power did not diminish with time; if anything, the film’s afterlife has been almost as troublesome as the work itself. </p>

<p>In 1981, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-W-Hinckley-Jr">John Hinckley Jr.</a> – who had become obsessed with the film – attempted to assassinate Ronald Reagan in an effort to impress Jodie Foster. This incident <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt36998986/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_accord_1_cdt_t_1">shook Scorsese</a>, who briefly considered giving up filmmaking altogether.</p>

<p>Travis Bickle has been repeatedly elevated to the status of anti-hero. The character has cast a long cultural shadow, most obviously in Todd Phillips’s Joker (2019).</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt36998986/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_accord_1_cdt_t_1">2025 documentary series</a> reflecting on Scorsese’s career returns to this question of legacy. Director Rebecca Williams puts it to Schrader that she gets the impression that “there are a lot of Travis Bickles, especially right now.” Schrader’s reply is blunt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They’re all talking to each other on the internet. When I first wrote about him, he was talking to nobody. He really was, at that point, the Underground Man. Now he’s the Internet Man. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a sobering thought.</p>

        <div>
<p>PROVO, Utah — The capital murder case against the man accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk is in its early stages, but conspiracy theories about Kirk’s death are already shaping the court proceedings.</p>



<p>Utah prosecutors allege 22-year-old Tyler Robinson shot and killed the CEO of Turning Point USA at a September event on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem — an assassination in broad daylight, witnessed by thousands in person and millions more online. The state says it has compelling evidence in its case against Robinson, including the murder weapon, DNA, bullet casings, security camera footage, text messages and other electronic communications. And, according to the state, Robinson has confessed.</p>



<p>But online, <a href="https://t.co/tK8LsDwW3X">alternative theories</a> and the ham-fisted investigations behind them have taken over. Conspiracist influencers, podcasters and gossip vloggers, armed with little credible evidence to support their claims, have flooded social platforms and fringe media channels with unfounded theories. They claim Robinson was a patsy, framed or possibly controlled by shadowy actors, including, Israel; the U.S. government; Turning Point USA; or even Kirk’s widow, Erika, who took over the organization after his death.</p>



<p>The theories are evolving week to week, as wannabe detectives online draw spurious connections between powerful groups and the flight logs of private planes, unverified reports from anonymous tipsters and video of Kirk’s killing and the aftermath, collected from dozens of angles, spliced and dissected to paint the picture of a coordinated plot.</p>



<p>Robinson’s trial is months away, but these alternative narratives are already seeping into the courtroom.</p>



<p>At a pretrial hearing Tuesday to determine whether state prosecutors should be removed from the case over an alleged conflict of interest, Robinson appeared in a lilac tie and shackles. A pair of conspiracist YouTubers sat on benches directly behind his parents, alongside members of the general public and a few dozen journalists, including this one.</p>



<p>Cross-examining a state agent about the scope of the investigation, defense attorney Kathy Nester asked whether investigators had looked into the alternative theories surrounding the shooting, including online videos claiming the existence of additional shooters.</p>



<p>“These videos have been used far and wide to look to see if there were potentially other shooters in the crowd,” Nester told Bureau of Investigation Agent Dave Hall. “Have you seen this on social media? Thousands of them?”</p>



<p>“Are you aware,” she continued, “that the videos taken from the scene have been analyzed by people on social media and in the press to see if there was somebody else that could have been involved in this?”</p>



<p>“I’m aware that everybody has a theory on the case,” Hall replied.</p>



<p>“Everybody has a theory on it, right?” Nester said. ”Whether those theories are good or bad, or whether your theory is good or bad … you guys should at least take a look at them. Fair?”</p>



<p>Her line of questioning suggests that these outside theories could play a significant role in the case going forward. They’ve already been invoked by multiple parties, at hearings and in pretrial motions, to sway Judge Tony Graf in one way or another. Robinson’s defense cited them as a reason to restrict public access to the proceedings, and by Erika Kirk — as well as lawyers representing a consortium of media — as a reason to make them more public.</p>



<p>The defense asked that video and still cameras be barred, claiming that biased media coverage could unfairly affect Robinson’s right to a fair trial. The state objected to the motion. </p>



<p>“Speculation and misinformation have already developed in the absence of full public access to courtroom proceedings,” prosecutors wrote. “When the public cannot observe testimony, rulings, and evidentiary context directly, narratives inevitably fill the vacuum.”

<p>For months, Erika Kirk has been targeted by online mobs alleging her complicity in her husband’s killing — bizarre claims that Turning Point USA has countered with public denials and cease-and-desist letters. On Monday, Kirk invoked the conspiracy theories in her own court filing, asking Graf not to limit public access to the proceedings.</p>



<p>“Public attention cannot be ignored,” Kirk wrote. Without access, she continued, the public won’t be able to see the evidence for themselves, and “in the absence of transparency, speculation, misinformation and conspiracy theories are likely to proliferate, eroding public confidence in the judicial process.”</p>



<p>In court Tuesday, Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray seemed to acknowledge that public speculation — if not the conspiratorial claims surrounding the case — had already influenced the case. He said from the witness stand that the state’s decision to seek the death penalty, announced just days after Kirk’s killing, had been driven in part by a desire to head off such gossip.</p>



<p>Gray said earlier cases had taught him that delaying such decisions only created “unnecessary public speculation” and “unnecessary angst with families of victims.”</p>



<p>“I wanted to shut that out,” Gray said.</p>



<p>It seems clear, though, that the fevered speculation will continue.</p>



<p>Conspiracist creators livestreamed Tuesday’s hearing, and within hours, had cut clips from the proceedings into fresh content for their eager audiences. One prominent creator on X called his latest video: “Patsy Plot Unravels.”</p>



<p>A preliminary hearing is scheduled for May, when the state will present evidence and a judge will decide whether the case goes to trial. In the meantime, the conspiracy theories will keep spreading online, and may continue to affect the case.</p>

        <div><div><p>There is an art to a proper meat pie, according to the Seattle chef and butcher Kevin Smith. The American pot pie frustrates him because it lets the pot do the heavy lifting. “The real way of doing it, for me, is to make a freestanding pie,” Smith says. The pastry should hold itself up, a technique cooks in England have honed over centuries. “That is so much more theatrical.”</p></div><div><p>Those meat pies — densely packed with beef shank in Guinness gravy, or chile tinged-lamb korma — anchor the menu at <a href="https://beastandcleaver.com/the-little-beast/">Little Beast</a>, Smith’s new English pub. For Smith, who also runs the butcher shop <a href="https://beastandcleaver.com/">Beast and Cleaver</a> and the restaurants the Peasant and the Beastro inside it, the venture marks a return to his South London upbringing. “It’s very, very classic English food,” he says. Both London and Seattle can be cold, gray, and gloomy. In both cities, one needs food that “warms the bones,” he says, and coziness is the impulse of the moment.</p></div><div><p>Smith’s goal is to truly recreate a quintessential English pub. This, to him, meant rustic, a little dark, not at all fancy — just the kind of place where people can “come in and sling their coat over the back of a chair,” Smith says. So far, his homey pub has been a hit: Eater Seattle named Little Beast its <a href="https://seattle.eater.com/restaurant-news/89523/eater-awards-winners-seattle-2025">Restaurant of the Year</a> in 2025.</p></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://platform.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/Eater_Lords_051.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,8.3333333333333,100,83.333333333333"><img alt="a spread of dishes at lord’s including crispy pig’s head served with radicchio, a scotch egg, and welsh rarebit. in the background, a diner grips a bottle of worcestershire sauce." src="https://platform.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/Eater_Lords_051.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=2400"></a></div></div></div><div><figcaption>Lord’s serves dishes like a curried lamb Scotch egg, Welsh rarebit topped with anchovies, and crispy fried pig’s head</figcaption> <cite>Photo by Jutharat ‘Poupay’ Pinyodoonyachet</cite></div></div></div></div><div><p>It’s no longer time to speculate whether the British are coming; they’re very much here. Like Little Beast, British-style pubs and country restaurants are cropping up across the United States, with hotspots including <a href="http://wildesla.com/">Wilde’s</a> in Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.dinglespublichouse.com/">Dingles Public House</a> in San Francisco, <a href="https://thebellnola.com/">the Bell</a> in New Orleans (“an easygoing neighborhood joint with an English accent”), and <a href="https://thechumleyhouse.com/">the Chumley House</a> in Fort Worth, Texas. In Chicago, the new <a href="https://piccadillymktpub.com/">Piccadilly Pub</a> fashions itself as a “neighborhood chippy,” and in Philadelphia, the chef Ange Branca, whose Malaysian restaurant Kampar has been closed since last February due to a fire, recently ran <a href="https://www.instagram.com/modspuds">Mod Spuds</a>, a pop-up <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/food/mod-spuds-jacket-potato-kampar-20251210.html">that served</a> loaded English “jacket potatoes.”</p></div><div><p>In New York City, chef Ed Szymanski has built some of the city’s most solid new restaurants around his own homesickness, including the English seafood restaurant <a href="https://www.damenewyork.com/">Dame</a> and the meatier “English bistro” <a href="https://www.lordsenglish.com/">Lord’s</a>; chef Jess Shadbolt <a href="https://ny.eater.com/news/404553/deans-nyc-british-seafood-restaurant-opening-2026-king-jess-shadbolt-annie-shi">will soon unveil Dean’s</a>, a British seafood restaurant inspired by her seaside hometown. And recently, sticky toffee pudding, one of England’s most popular desserts, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/t-magazine/sticky-toffee-pudding.html">has also served as a major source of inspiration</a> for pastry chefs across the country.</p></div><div><p>It’s natural for any cuisine that’s been maligned in the global sphere to want a redemption arc, and for so long, British food has been the butt of jokes: mushy, beige, brown, bland — the kind of sadness that writer Aisling McCrea <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8586/why-is-british-food-so-bad">once ascribed</a> to British people being “too repressed to cook food correctly.” For rising star NYC pastry chef Lilli Maren Beard, who grew up in London, the goal of her work is updating British pastry classics “so that they’re actually good,” as she puts it on her Substack publication <a href="https://lillimaren.substack.com/">The Buttery</a>. “I think the [bad] reputation comes from the pure fact that British food has to be tasted: It’s food that’s meant to be eaten, not to be looked at,” Beard says. Beige and brown mush is “bad PR” for its “beautiful flavors.”</p></div><div><p>Now, young chefs like herself, Beard says, are having a “similar journey” of realizing the “trove” of delicious food in their history and wanting to show it off with personality, a sense of humor, and, yes, better visuals, too.</p></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://platform.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/Eater_Seattles_Best_Restaurants_The_Little_Beast_Brooke_Fitts022-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,8.3333333333333,100,83.333333333333"><img alt="a thick meat pie filled with lamb korma sits on a white plate. it’s covered in gravy, which surrounds the pie on the plate, and topped with two red chile peppers." src="https://platform.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/Eater_Seattles_Best_Restaurants_The_Little_Beast_Brooke_Fitts022-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=2400"></a></div></div></div><div><figcaption>One of chef Kevin Smith’s signature dishes at Little Beast is the lamb korma pie</figcaption> <cite>Photo by Brooke Fitts</cite></div></div></div></div><div><p>Follow a few young British chefs on social media and you’ll quickly start to wonder why the cuisine has a bad name. Through short-form videos, places like Manchester’s <a href="https://ondapastabar.com/">Onda Pasta Bar</a> (of viral “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CxNsIMItuAx/?hl=en">tiramisu drawer</a>” fame) and London’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fallowrestaurant/reels/#">Fallow</a> have become <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/skin-game-media_marketing-contentstrategy-brandbuilding-activity-7384214536288985088-XQkH">as much media brands</a> as they are restaurants. From chefs-turned-creators, you’ll find bangers and mash that look undeniably delicious, roasted chickens swimming in luxurious drippings, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/C5BhbjbokN1/">gravy-filled meat pies</a> laden with so much butter that there’s no way they could be bad — lest we forget that butter <a href="/23132476/butter-tiktok-chef-thomas-straker">formed the foundation</a> of London chef Thomas Straker’s global ascent.</p></div><div><p>“These people are generally broadcasting to a British audience,” says the London-based restaurant critic Jonathan Nunn, who runs the publication <a href="https://www.vittlesmagazine.com/">Vittles</a>. Particularly, that’s “an East London, South London audience who are very plugged into what is going on in food culture internationally and what is going on in London restaurants, and wants to replicate those things in their homes in a way that doesn’t really look like dishes their parents made but are still recognizably British dishes.”</p></div><div><p>According to Nunn, this social media moment is British people hyping up British food for British people. That this might influence the perception of British food to non-British people “is just a byproduct of that.” As “strange” as it is to think of British food as “exotic,” he says, “I think Americans are fascinated by [British food] in the same way anyone would be fascinated by anything ‘exotic.’”</p></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://platform.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/Wildes_KortHavens_6.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100"><img alt="tk" src="https://platform.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/Wildes_KortHavens_6.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></div></div></div><div><figcaption>Fish and chips are a “core dish” for Natasha Price, executive chef and co-owner of Wilde’s</figcaption> <cite>Photo by Kort Havens</cite></div></div></div></div><div><p>Perhaps part of the appeal of British food in the U.S. right now is simply that it’s just different enough to be newly compelling. Fish sticks aren’t particularly en vogue, but good fish and chips? That pulls in an “<a href="/22549458/chef-ed-szymanski-fish-and-chips-seafood-restaurant-dame-nyc">overwhelming</a>” demand, as Szymanski learned during his pandemic pop-up. Lending an air of intrigue, it’s on the menu at Wilde’s as “battered skate &amp; mint.”</p></div><div><p>In recent years, American dining culture has largely been <a href="/24104963/french-bistro-brasserie-trend">filtered through the lens of the French bistro</a>, so maybe the rising English pub moment is an indicator that we’ve become bistro-ed out. The “new American” restaurant, the French bistro, and the modern English pub — these don’t offer wildly different food so much as they offer a sense of a change of environs. As concepts, they’re familiar enough to be easy, different enough to be destinations. “I think it’s very relatable [food],” Smith says, adding that “the food that people think is bad over here, as in English food, is actually what a lot of American food is based on.” Making British food for American audiences requires some concessions though: That’s why Lord’s also serves a Welsh rarebit <em>burger</em> and sticky toffee pudding <em>pancakes</em>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://platform.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/251100_GYMLV_Photo-Credit-AVABLU_Chicken-Butter-Masala.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100"><img alt="a small metal pot of butter chicken sits next to a basket of herb-topped naan on a marble tape at the restaurant gymkhana" src="https://platform.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/251100_GYMLV_Photo-Credit-AVABLU_Chicken-Butter-Masala.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></div></div></div><div><figcaption>Indian fine dining restaurant Gymkhana opened its first U.S. location in December</figcaption> <cite>Photo by AVABLU</cite></div></div></div></div><div><p>All this recent Anglophilia has yet to even touch on the incoming British imports.

While London’s contributions to the U.S. have historically centered around the kind of <a href="https://london.eater.com/venue/31418/st-john-bread-and-wine">St. John</a>-inflected nose-to-tail gastropub, as reflected in stateside openings Little Beast and Lord’s, Dishoom and Gymkhana represent the essential nature of British Indian food.</p></div><div><p>“That’s as part of modern British food culture as anything else,” Nunn says. “That kind of hybridity being accepted as part of British cuisine on a global level, and being recognized as such, is a good thing.”</p></div><div><div><form><div><div><h2>Eater Today</h2><p><span>The freshest news from the food world every day</span></p></div><div><fieldset><div><div><div><label>Email (required)</label><div><input></div></div></div><button><span>Sign Up</span></button></div></fieldset><div><div>By submitting your email, you agree to our<!-- --> <a href="https://www.voxmedia.com/legal/terms-of-use">Terms</a> and <a href="https://www.voxmedia.com/legal/privacy-notice">Privacy Notice</a>. <!-- -->This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google<!-- --> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> <!-- -->apply.</div></div></div></div></form></div></div><div><span>See More<!-- -->:<span> </span></span><ul><li><a href="/trends">Food and Restaurant Trends</a></li><li><a href="/dining-out">Dining Out</a></li></ul></div></div>

As an African American woman, West overcame huge barriers to contribute to this key technology. She was one of many women of her generation whose talents helped to propel the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01585-9">mid-twentieth-century cold-war technology</a> boom in the United States. Programming some of the most powerful computers of the time, West pushed the horizons of computation and communication. She has died, aged 95.</p><p>West was born in a farming family in rural Virginia. She excelled in her studies, but because of the Jim Crow laws that barred Black children from the well-funded schools that white students enjoyed, she attended a vocational-training school rather than an academically oriented secondary school. She earned a scholarship to Virginia State College, a historically Black college in Petersburg, where she was one of the few women to study mathematics. West obtained her master’s degree there in 1955.</p><p>West’s desire to find a profession that would open up possibilities for her propelled her to take up a position at a research and development centre, then called the Naval Proving Ground, Dahlgren, in Virginia. When she started, she was one of only two Black women and four Black professionals. The double burden of discrimination made West feel like an outsider among both the white women who worked at the centre — whose conversations, she recalled, would often fall silent as she approached — and her male co-workers. She was keenly aware that she should keep her head down and never “allude to the fact she had different ideas”. West was unable to travel with her colleagues because of segregation laws and missed out on opportunities as a result.</p><p><article><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04151-9"><img alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00254-z/d41586-026-00254-z_51974134.jpg"><p>These women helped to shape quantum mechanics — it’s time to recognize them</p></a></article></p><p>Moreover, secrecy sometimes hid the full impact of her work from her. “We didn’t know exactly where it was going because we worked for the military where everything is secret,” West recalled. Nevertheless, she embarked on research at the centre that shaped her later accomplishments. In 1962, West worked on Project 29V in the computational division’s scientific programming and analysis branch. Her job was to calculate the orbit of Pluto in relation to Neptune. She was part of a team that programmed a computer to perform more than five billion calculations, taking nearly 100 hours of computer time.

<p>There was nothing special about the scenes from Edmonton: orderly lines of people in winter coats snaking across a snowy park, bare trees stark against a pale winter sky, the mundane choreography of civic participation playing out in a provincial capital most Americans couldn’t locate on a map.</p>

<p>Albertans queuing to sign a petition, even one to secede from Canada, could never compete for attention with the tragic, disorienting developments that filled the first long month of 2026: the ICE shooting in Minneapolis, Donald Trump’s bombastic threats to annex Greenland, and Canadian prime minister Mark Carney’s tense <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flsgJe8mN-A">warnings</a> from Davos about middle powers ending up “on the menu.” </p>



<p>But for those who’ve tracked how sovereignty collapses, these winter queues had an eerie resonance.<br><strong><br></strong>Almost as soon as he took office for his second term, Trump <a href="https://apnews.com/article/how-canada-could-become-us-state-42360e10ded96c0046fd11eaaf55ab88">began</a> calling Canada “the 51st state,” declaring that the country “only works” if it becomes part of the United States. He’d <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgx1ezpx52o">refuse</a> to use proper titles, referring to Canadian prime ministers as “Governor Trudeau” and later “Governor Carney.” He <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/article/trump-shares-altered-map-of-us-flag-covering-canada-greenland-and-venezuela/">posted</a> altered maps showing Canada as U.S. territory. It played as crude humor, vintage Trump bluster designed to dominate the news cycle and unsettle an ally he viewed as weak. But by January 2026, as Trump’s threats to annex Greenland dominated headlines, his drip-drip taunting of Canada had calcified into something concrete on the ground in Alberta, had given shape and momentum to a once low-key secessionist sentiment.</p>



<p>The Alberta Prosperity Project needs 177,732 signatures by May to trigger a referendum on secession from Canada. Their representatives claim they’ve made “repeated visits” to Washington to meet with senior Trump administration officials, meetings they say took place inside the kind of secure facility reserved for discussing classified intelligence. </p>



<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent publicly declared that Alberta should “come down into the U.S.” as a “natural partner.” Republican Congressman Andy Ogles <a href="https://x.com/cspotweet/status/2014058390817820969">told</a> the BBC that Albertans “would prefer not to be part of Canada and be part of the United States because we are winning day in and day out.” According to the separatists’ own materials, their vision includes a “common market” with the U.S., zero tariffs, adoption of the U.S. dollar and construction of two oil pipelines through American territory. Spokesperson Jeffrey Rath has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/11dc2140-6a5d-4536-b766-52c920affcc7">claimed</a> the U.S. would potentially provide a $500 billion line of credit to the newly independent Alberta.</p>

<h2><strong>Widening the Overton window</strong></h2>



<p>A referendum on Albertan secession, should it happen, appears almost certain to fail. Polls show only 24% of Albertans support joining the U.S., with 65% strongly opposed. Most media outside Canada has treated this as a fringe story. But the language being used by the Trump administration in support of secession is becoming a textbook example of how the Overton window shifts: say the outrageous thing, let it be dismissed as mischievous troublemaking, and then watch as domestic actors race to occupy the newly opened political space. Repeat until the “absurd” becomes debatable, and the debatable becomes negotiable. When a U.S. Treasury Secretary publicly advocates for a Canadian province to secede and join America, he’s not predicting the future — he’s manufacturing a present in which such conversations become possible. There’s no master plan; the chaos itself creates opportunity.</p>



<p>The timing matters. Mark Carney has emerged as the strongest voice pushing back against Trump’s increasingly aggressive rhetoric, most notably in his Davos speech warning that middle powers risk ending up “on the menu.” Daniel Béland, a political scientist at McGill University who studies Canadian federalism, sees Alberta separatism as potentially serving a strategic purpose for the Trump administration: “Mark Carney is standing up to Trump. We saw what happened in Davos, right? So maybe they see that what’s happening in Alberta is weakening both Canada and Carney.”</p>



<p>The reason this story matters has less to do with the petition itself than with the narrative infrastructure being built around it. Recently, the exiled Russian news agency Meduza <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2026/01/23/they-won-t-shut-up-about-greenland-meduza-obtains-the-kremlin-s-instructions-for-state-media-covering-trump-s-standoff-with-denmark">obtained</a> a manual that the Kremlin had distributed to state-owned and pro-government media outlets instructing them how to cover Trump’s Greenland standoff. The directives were explicit: emphasize that territorial expansion is what “strong countries” do, that Trump is “aiming for Vladimir Putin’s success,” that conflicts with European countries “will be forgotten, but the territories will remain.” Journalists were told to frame NATO as “collapsing” and Putin as “forcing America to engage in equal dialogue” while European leaders “halfheartedly protest on social media.”</p>



<p>For Russian and Chinese state outlets, <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/631704-canada-separatists-trump-administration/">coverage</a> of Albertan separatism is in keeping with the broad narrative that Western alliances are <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202601/1354158.shtml">fracturing</a> and sovereignty is negotiable for resource-rich regions. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, meanwhile, has spent the past year articulating what he calls a doctrine of “hemispheric defense,” framing Canada not as an ally but as territory that needs to be controlled. A “rapidly changing” Canada, he has said, in which 25% of the population is “foreign-born” means “these people are hostile to the United States of America.” Canada, Bannon <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15471249/Trump-Greenland-Canada-Donroe-Doctrine.html?ito=native_share_article-top">claims</a>, “is the next Ukraine.”</p>



<p>While Bannon has spoken extensively about hemispheric defence and Canada’s strategic value as a U.S. protectorate, there’s been no official movement towards such a goal — no Pentagon study, no Congressional authorization hearings, no legal pathway to annexation. Trump can troll, Bannon can theorize, Bessent can advocate, but no one appears to be seriously suggesting executing a plan. The damage isn’t in the doing, it’s in the destabilization, it’s in normalizing the conversation.</p>



<p>A parallel playbook doesn’t mean identical outcomes. There will be no little green men, no masked special forces in Calgary. But in 2014, when Russia entered Crimea, it wasn’t military occupation alone, it began with the systematic deployment of narratives that made annexation appear inevitable, even locally driven, before troops ever arrived. And now the Kremlin <a href="https://tass.com/politics/2078863">argues</a> hypocrisy when the United Nations Secretary General <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/press-events/2026-01-29/secretary-generals-press-conference-his-2026-priorities">says</a> the principle of the “self-determination of peoples has a number of requisites.” </p>



<h2><strong>Déjà vu</strong></h2>



<p>My view is shaped by what I’ve witnessed: Russian-backed separatists taking over my grandparents’ house in Abkhazia in the 1990s, years of reporting from South Ossetia before Russia seized it in 2008, and standing outside a Ukrainian military base in Perevalnoe in 2014, watching Russian soldiers in unmarked uniforms take control while Moscow denied they were even there.</p>



<figure><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABesAAASwAQMAAABRlYPzAAAAA1BMVEVHcEyC+tLSAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAPVJREFUeNrtwTEBAAAAwqD1T20KP6AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC+Bn99AAGkXWhmAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC" alt=""><noscript><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2230039771BBB-1515x1200.jpg" alt=""></noscript><figcaption>Map of Ukraine locating territories claimed by Russia (Including Crimea, which was annexed in 2014)  as of August 17, 2025.

<p>The annexation of Crimea showed how the ground for seizing sovereignty is laid through manufactured political theater. A politician whose party won 4% of the vote in 2010 was installed at gunpoint and held a referendum under occupation that reported 96.7% of people supported joining Russia. He’s still in charge.</p>



<p>Provinces and regions challenge sovereignty regularly. In Scotland’s 2014 referendum on whether it should be independent of the United Kingdom, nearly 45% voted ‘yes.’ Catalonia’s 2017 referendum saw 48% back independence from Spain before Madrid blocked it through force, both physical and legal. Quebec came within 1% of secession in 1995, a margin so narrow it prompted federal legislation defining how provinces could leave.</p>



<p>What distinguishes Alberta isn’t the referendum mechanism, it’s the involvement of a foreign power. In every previous case, challenges to sovereignty remained internal disputes. Spain’s government opposed Catalonia, but secessionists didn’t visit France to seek €500 billion in credit from the French government. Canada addressed Quebec’s grievances, but the U.S. Treasury Secretary at the time didn’t suggest that Quebec should “come down into the U.S.”</p>



<p>The overt encouragement of Albertan secession is without precedent among Western democracies. Canada faces provocation by a superpower neighbor whose cabinet officials actively encourage provincial secession, whose political figures meet separatist leaders in secure intelligence facilities, and whose state apparatus treats a G7 ally’s territorial integrity as negotiable. “This is something that, at least to my knowledge, is unprecedented,” says Béland, referring to US State Department meetings with Alberta separatists. </p>



<h2><strong>The architecture of erosion</strong></h2>



<p>The conditions in Alberta and Crimea are, of course, fundamentally different: no troops, no armed separatists, and Alberta is a democracy in which roughly 76% oppose joining the U.S., if not necessarily Albertan independence. What’s comparable though is the vocabulary being used in the U.S.: the systematic framing of sovereignty as conditional, resources as rightfully belonging to a more powerful neighbor, and local grievances as requiring external “solutions.” </p>



<p>The rhetorical architecture that made Crimea possible is now being constructed around Alberta. That architecture requires foundation stones, and Alberta has them. When the province joined Canada in 1905, Ottawa retained control of Alberta’s natural resources though Ontario and Quebec got to keep theirs. This inequity was corrected in 1930, but the resentment lingered. In 1980, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau imposed a 25% federal tax on Alberta’s oil and seized control of pricing. The backlash was fierce: unemployment soared, projects collapsed, and “let the eastern bastards freeze in the dark” became a rallying cry. Separatist movements have flared and faded for decades, always returning to the same core grievance: Alberta produces 90% of Canada’s oil, Canada sells 95% of it to the United States, yet Alberta feels like a resource colony for Eastern Canada’s benefit.</p>

<p>Russia exploited similar dynamics in Crimea: real economic marginalization, language politics, the feeling of being a colony for Kyiv’s benefit. External powers don’t create these grievances, but they weaponize them. And just as in Crimea, it’s indigenous populations raising the alarm first. The Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article-first-nation-launches-legal-action-against-potential-alberta/">filed</a> a lawsuit arguing that Alberta cannot hold a referendum without indigenous consent, and explicitly warning that a referendum “will enable foreign interference from the most powerful neighbor to the south.” In Crimea, the indigenous Tatar population boycotted the 2014 referendum and suffered systematic repression afterward.</p>



<p>Alberta’s premier, Danielle Smith, has walked a careful line, speaking about her desire to stay a part of Canada while defending the need to hold a referendum. She met Trump at Mar-a-Lago days before his inauguration last year, speaking of the “need to preserve our independence while we grow this critical partnership.” But when the referendum petition was approved, she framed it as a democratic duty: “You need to have a pressure-release valve on issues that people care about.” According to the Globe and Mail, Canadian defense officials have recently <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-military-models-canadian-response-to-hypothetical-american-invasion/">modeled</a> a U.S. invasion scenario for the first time in over a century: a theoretical planning exercise, not an operational war plan. The modeling assumed American forces would overcome Canadian positions in as little as 2 days, prompting examination of asymmetric responses: sabotage, drones, dispersed resistance. Officials stressed an invasion remains highly unlikely. But allies don’t conduct theoretical exercises in fratricide unless something fundamental has shifted.</p>



<h2><strong>The shifting burden</strong></h2>



<p>Stories matter. The current collapse of Europe’s post-Cold War security arrangement began with narratives that made that collapse imaginable.</p>



<p>From the mid-2000s, Russian state television started hosting marginal voices questioning Ukraine’s right to exist. In 2008, the Russian daily Kommersant <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/archive/putin-hints-at-splitting-up-ukraine">reported</a> that in a private meeting, Putin told George W. Bush that Ukraine was “not even a state” and that the Kremlin would be encouraging secession in both Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Six years of this rhetoric made Ukrainian sovereignty negotiable before a single soldier crossed the border.</p>



<p>Trump has spent over a year declaring Canada “only works” as part of the United States while his Treasury Secretary publicly advocates for Alberta’s secession and Bannon, whose finger is frequently firmly on MAGA’s pulse, calls the country “hostile” and “the next Ukraine.” Béland warns that the damage from this process extends beyond the referendum’s outcome: “Even if the ‘no’ wins, the remain side wins, and even if it’s an easy victory… having a referendum campaign is highly divisive in and of itself, and it opens the door to potential U.S. interference.”</p>



<p>Sovereignty doesn’t collapse with a single referendum. It erodes in the accumulation of moments when defending it appears unreasonable, when maintaining it requires constant <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/29/americas/canada-carney-trump-alberta-separatists-latam-intl">justification</a>, when the burden of proof shifts from those who would divide to those who would preserve.</p>

        <section><p>Nothing makes Americans want to gamble like the Super Bowl. Every year, the game is reliably the biggest day for sports betting: On platforms such as FanDuel and DraftKings, people are already putting money down on which team will win the opening coin toss, how long the national anthem will be, and what color of Gatorade will be used to douse the winning head coach.</p><p>Gambling on sports has become practically inescapable. Nearly half of American men ages 18 to 49 <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/27/nx-s1-5680145/sports-betting-callout">maintain</a> an active online sports-betting account, and Vegas odds have invaded telecasts and talk shows. During NFL games, sportsbook commercials now outnumber beer ads. Despite all of that, more than a third of adults still cannot legally gamble from home: Online sports betting remains banned in 18 states, including California and Texas.</p><p>But for the past year, thanks to a loophole, Americans have effectively been able to bet on sports no matter where they live. All they have to do is turn to prediction markets. Platforms such as Kalshi let people wager on lots of things: Who will win the Oscar for Best Actor? How much snow will New York City get this month? Prediction markets say that they are more akin to the stock market than gambling. Rather than betting on odds set by bookmakers, users trade contracts that pay out according to the outcome of a given event. This distinction may not mean much for someone betting on the Seahawks over the Patriots, but it does allow prediction markets to operate even in places where sports betting is illegal.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/10/sports-betting-kalshi-cftc/684689/">Read: The company making a mockery of state gambling laws</a></p><p>Now America is about to find out what it really looks like when sports betting takes over. Kalshi, one of the country’s biggest prediction markets, launched its sport-betting operation just two weeks before the 2025 Super Bowl. This year, Kalshi has already seen more than $167 million in bets on the game, and that number could conceivably crack <em>$1 billion</em>, Dustin Gouker, a gambling-industry analyst, told me. Some of the biggest traditional sportsbooks and fantasy-sports sites, recognizing a work-around to enter states where gambling remains illegal, are seizing the opportunity: Since September, FanDuel, DraftKings, Fanatics, PrizePicks, and Underdog have all launched their own prediction-market offerings.</p><p>In one sense, prediction markets are about a whole lot more than sports. Both Kalshi and its biggest rival, Polymarket, have turned prediction markets into big business by letting people wager on seemingly everything. As Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour put it in October, the company’s goal is to “financialize everything”—to let people bet on the outcome of virtually any event. By encouraging people to put their money where their mouth is, the thinking goes, prediction markets can forecast how the future will play out. Even if you’ve never placed a bet yourself, prediction markets’ odds about news and entertainment—not sports—<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/america-polymarket-disaster/685662/">are especially in your face</a>. Both CNN and CNBC recently announced partnerships with Kalshi to incorporate the site’s predictions into their news coverage; last month, the Golden Globes displayed Polymarket’s odds throughout its broadcast.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/america-polymarket-disaster/685662/">Read: America is slow-walking into a Polymarket disaster</a></p><p></p><p>Kalshi may let you bet on topics as wide-ranging as whether Iran’s supreme leader <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxkhameneiout/ali-khamenei-out/kxkhameneiout-akha">will stay in power</a> and who will win the <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxsurvivor/who-will-win-survivor/kxsurvivor-26dec31">next season of </a><a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxsurvivor/who-will-win-survivor/kxsurvivor-26dec31"><em>Survivor</em></a>, but sports account for <a href="https://closingline.substack.com/p/the-takeaway-kalshi-non-sports-volume">more than 90 percent</a> of all trading volume on the site. From mid-December to mid-January, wagers on college basketball alone exceeded trading on everything other than sports. The single biggest non-sports market during this stretch—about whom President Trump would nominate as chair of the Federal Reserve—drew less activity than Italian soccer. In an email, Jack Such, a Kalshi spokesperson, told me that the categories that dominate the platform fluctuate based on what’s in the news. “During the NFL season, we are heavily tilted towards sports,” he wrote. “During the 2024 election season, we were heavily tilted towards politics. It all depends on what events are top of mind for the public.” Even though politics was big on Kalshi during the most recent presidential election, that was before the site offered sports betting.</p><p>Sports make up a smaller proportion of wagers on Polymarket, which has also yet to fully launch in the United States (although some Americans likely still access it by using virtual private networks). “At this moment in time, the use case of prediction markets, at least in the United States, appears to be the expansion of sports betting,” Gouker said. “It’s hard to come to another conclusion.”</p><p>This covert expansion of sports betting is controversial. Several states are <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wsj.com/business/media/this-nfl-seasons-fiercest-rivalry-is-sports-betting-vs-prediction-markets-1952aa61?utm_sf_cserv_ref%3D8304333127%26utm_sf_post_ref%3D658601284%26mod%3De2fb%26fbclid%3DIwY2xjawPvZRpleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFCYTJhT0pNYk9tRXZGRnJuc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHqzaeIh55L4tx6i8rbd4LpFqSLsnwbZ7Mtn7VeSio8MdkhZ7jonAXYYHNElC_aem_urQNoCOtz4SBvWuTLNm5Uw&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1770167674627642&amp;usg=AOvVaw12FFcAO_7bhdTYnSNzndoG">suing</a> Kalshi for operating an unlicensed sports-betting platform, which they argue deprives them of tax dollars. But late last month, Michael Selig, the newly appointed head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates prediction markets, indicated that he intends to help grow the prediction-market industry. All of which suggests that, in the immediate term at least, prediction markets are likely to make sports betting an even more pervasive part of American life—potentially leading to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/legal-sports-gambling-was-mistake/679925/">devastating consequences</a>. Research suggests that avid sports bettors are at risk of depleting their household savings, declaring bankruptcy, and even committing intimate-partner violence.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/06/sports-betting-gambling-addiction/683042/">Read: ‘I’m treating guys who would never be caught dead in a casino’</a></p><p>Not all prediction markets, for their part, are likely to be content with staying de facto sports-betting sites. After all, Kalshi and Polymarket want to harness the wisdom of crowds to forecast all kinds of real-world events, not just sports outcomes. Despite Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan’s recent proclamation that prediction markets are “the most accurate thing we have as mankind right now,” these platforms have much to prove on that front. When most bets are on sports, it’s especially hard to see what value prediction markets add. The kind of information gained by thousands of bettors laying down four-legged parlays on a Tuesday-night NBA game does not have the same utility as a more accurate hurricane forecast or election prediction. Not all knowledge, in other words, is created equal.</p><p>Perhaps prediction markets are hoping that once sports betting gets users in the door, they’ll engage with the many other markets on offer. “I think they’ve really thought that sports would just be an entry point, and then everything else would start growing,” Gouker said. But that Kalshi will be able to interest its droves of sports bettors in other markets is by no means guaranteed. In fact, it seems at least equally plausible that people might just prefer betting on the Super Bowl to betting on whether the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates. “People who are making forecasts on political and social and scientific outcomes are possibly different from people who are betting on sporting events,” John Phillips, the CEO of Aristotle, the company that runs the prediction market PredictIt, told me. “There are some commonalities there, but I think it’s a different type of activity and it attracts a different type of trader.”</p><p>If the goal of Kalshi and other prediction markets is to create something with genuine financial utility and predictive power, that’s a big problem. But this won’t prevent them from making a boatload of money along the way.</p><div></div></section>

        <section><p><em><small>This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. </small></em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/"><em><small>Sign up for it here.</small></em></a></p><p>S<span>ome dictators go down fighting</span>. Some are lynched and strung up for their victims to spit on. Some die in bed.</p><p>Bashar al-Assad, who oversaw the torture and murder of hundreds of thousands of his fellow Syrians during a quarter century in power, may have achieved something new in the annals of tyranny. As the rebels closed in on Damascus on December 7, 2024, Assad reassured his aides and subordinates that victory was near, and then fled in the night on a Russian jet, telling almost no one. I remember seeing a statement issued that same evening declaring that Assad was at the palace performing his “constitutional duties.” Some of his closest aides were fooled and had to escape the country however they could as rebel militias lit up the sky with celebratory gunfire.</p><p>Assad’s betrayal was so breathtakingly craven that some people had trouble believing it at first. When the facts became impossible to deny, the loyalty of thousands of people curdled almost instantly into fury. Many swore that they had always secretly hated him. There is an expression in Arabic for this kind of revisionist memory: When the cow falls, the butchers multiply.</p><p>But the emotion was real for many, as was the belief that Assad was solely responsible for everything that had gone wrong. “You can still find people who believe in Muammar Qaddafi, who believe in Saddam Hussein,” Ibrahim Hamidi, a Syrian journalist and editor, told me. “No one now believes in Bashar al-Assad, not even his brother.”</p><p>The sudden collapse of the Assad regime put an end to a cruel police state, but now there is virtually no Syrian state at all outside the capital. The country’s new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has done a superb job of charming Donald Trump and other world leaders. He is also an Islamist whose authority is tenuous, and whose country remains so dangerously volatile that it could easily descend into another war.</p><p>No one—not the CIA, not the Mossad—appears to have had any idea that Assad would fall so fast. But in the days and weeks afterward, an explanation for his regime’s collapse began to gain currency. Assad’s backers, Russia and Iran, had been drawn into other conflicts, with Ukraine and Israel respectively, and no longer had the ability to protect him. Their sudden withdrawal exposed what had been hidden in plain sight for years: the terrible weakness of an exhausted, corrupt, and underpaid army. A little like the American-backed regime in Afghanistan that fell in 2021, the Assad dynasty was the casualty of broader geopolitical realignments. After the fact, its fall came to seem inevitable.</p><p>But over the past year, I have spoken with dozens of the courtiers and officers who inhabited the palace in Damascus, and they tell a different story. Many describe a detached ruler, obsessed with sex and video games, who probably could have saved his regime at any time in the past few years if he hadn’t been so stubborn and vain. In this version, it was not geopolitics that doomed the regime. None of the countries in the region wanted Assad to fall, and several of them offered him lifelines. If he had taken hold of them, he would almost certainly be sitting in the palace now. Even in the final days, foreign ministers were calling, offering deals. He didn’t answer. He appears to have been sulking, angered by the suggestion that he might have to give up the throne.</p><p>In the end, Assad’s embittered loyalists may have been right. It <em>was</em> all about Bashar.</p><div><figure><picture><img alt="2026_02_05_The Fall of the House of Assad_Damascus.jpg" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/aC3IQGaZBRVbmbnEcEMe_fp0y9Y=/0x0:4000x3000/928x696/media/img/posts/2026/02/2026_02_05_The_Fall_of_the_House_of_Assad_Damascus/original.jpg"></picture><figcaption><div>Emin Özmen / Magnum Photos</div><div>Syrians celebrate the fall of the Assad regime in Damascus in December 2024<em>.</em></div></figcaption></figure></div><p>P<span>erhaps all autocrats </span>come to think of themselves as invincible, but Assad had a particular reason for his misplaced confidence: He had already survived one near-death experience.</p><p><br>The Arab Spring uprisings reached Syria in 2011 and blazed up into civil war. A large portion of the country’s people took up arms against its ruler, and scarcely anyone expected Assad to survive. “I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed,” Barack Obama <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/01/24/remarks-President-state-union-address">declared</a> in 2012. Obama was so confident that his State Department helped fund a “Day After Project” to be ready for the new Syria. My editors at <em>The New York Times</em> asked me to write an obituary of the Assad dynasty, and I remember thinking that I should get it done quickly. I still have it in my files.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/07/syria-violence-trump-dispute/683596/">Read: The dispute behind the violence in Syria</a></p><p>That obituary probably would have been published in 2015 if not for a deus ex machina named Vladimir Putin. A Russian intervention that began in September of that year changed everything for Assad. Waves of deadly air strikes by Russia’s Sukhoi and Tupolev jets, working in concert with Iranian and Shiite militias, shifted the momentum on the battlefield, inflicting fierce blows on the rebel forces. By now, the Syrian opposition, once led by nonviolent protesters, was dominated by Islamists, who were divided and feckless and could be easily lumped together with the telegenic savageries of the Islamic State, known as ISIS.</p><p>By late 2017, Assad had more or less won the war. His regime controlled the major cities, and the opposition was confined to the northwestern province of Idlib, where a former al-Qaeda leader named Ahmed al-Sharaa (then known as Abu Muhammad al-Jolani) was emerging as a leading figure.</p><p>That deceptive moment of victory, many Syrians have told me, was when everything started to go wrong. Assad didn’t seem to understand that his triumph was a hollow one. Large portions of his country had been reduced to rubble. The economy had shrunk almost to nothing, and sanctions levied by the United States and Europe were weighing it down even further. Syria’s sovereignty had been partly mortgaged to Russia and Iran, which were squeezing Damascus for money to repay their investment in the conflict. Assad’s supporters, having suffered through years of war and struggle, would not remain patient forever. With the fighting over, they began to expect some kind of reprieve.</p><p>Assad could have given his people what they wanted. The Gulf Arab states had the money and clout to bring him in from the cold, and in 2017, the United Arab Emirates began reaching out to Damascus. But it had a condition, the same one it had been seeking since before the civil war: Assad had to distance himself from Iran. The Gulf Arabs had long seen the revolutionary theocrats in Tehran as their biggest threat, and Syria’s long-standing alliance with them—forged by Bashar’s father, Hafez al-Assad—was a sore point with all of the other Arab leaders.</p><p>For Syria, exchanging Iran’s dubious company for the wealth of the Gulf made a lot of sense. But there was a catch: It wasn’t necessarily the best thing for the Assad family. Unlike the Gulf states and the West, the Iranians had always made clear that they would do anything to keep Assad in power. All he had to do in return was continue to facilitate Tehran’s provision of weapons and money through Syrian territory to Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia that was the star player in Tehran’s “Axis of Resistance.”</p><p>Assad did reach a modest rapprochement with the Emiratis, who reopened their embassy in Damascus in 2018. But he refused to cut his ties to Iran. Khaled al-Ahmad, a shrewd political operator in Assad’s inner circle who had negotiated the deal with the Emiratis and had briefly believed that a real political transition was possible, finally concluded that Assad was incapable of changing course. “I decided he was a dead elephant in the room,” he told me of Assad. (Ahmad is now an adviser to the new Syrian government.)</p><p>Around this time, a young Israeli national-security official reached the same conclusion and began urging his superiors to organize an internal coup against Assad. The Israelis had long viewed Assad as a manageable enemy—someone who mouthed all of the usual slogans about the Zionist enemy but kept the border between the two countries quiet. But the Israeli official, who is no longer in government service and spoke with me on the condition of anonymity, told me that around 2019, he began to fear that Assad was too feckless to be reliable. “The regime was an empty shell,” he said.</p><div><figure><picture><img alt="Bashar al-Assad with President of the United Arab Emirates, Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi." src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/vdP9OuuIil3kls0Wky2ZMnYOgWM=/0x0:4000x2667/928x619/media/img/posts/2026/02/2026_02_05_The_Fall_of_the_House_of_Assad_gulf/original.jpg"></picture><figcaption><div>UAE Presidential Court Handout / Andalou / Getty</div><div>Assad meets with the president of the United Arab Emirates, Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in Abu Dhabi on March 19, 2023.</div></figcaption></figure></div><p>The Israeli command demurred on the coup proposal. The idea had been discussed periodically over the years in Tel Aviv and Washington but had never gotten very far, perhaps because Assad’s father had deliberately created a regime that kept potential rivals in check or under surveillance.</p><p>“Everybody in the region was comfortable with him being there,” the former Israeli official said. “Being weak, posing a threat to no one.”</p><p>Assad apparently mistook this tacit consensus for power. “Bashar was living in a fictional world,” a former Hezbollah political operative who was often in Syria during those years told me (he asked for anonymity for fear of repercussions): “<em>The Iranians need me. The Russians have no choice. I’m the king.</em>”</p><p>A<span>ssad’s backers began to grumble</span>, but the Syrian leader wouldn’t listen. In 2019, the former Hezbollah operative said, the Russians and the Iranians began pushing him to make mostly symbolic reforms that would placate Western countries and ease the burden of Syria’s economic isolation. Assad lied and temporized, the official said. Iran’s foreign minister at the time, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7mH2F1N38I">recent interview</a> with Al Jazeera that he’d urged Assad to “engage with the opposition” but that the Syrian leader, “drunk with victory,” had stalled.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/05/syria-jihadist-assad-sharaa-druze/682796/">Read: The honeymoon is ending in Syria</a></p><p>Perhaps the most arresting example of Assad’s obtuseness came during the first Trump administration. In 2020, Washington sent two officials, Roger Carstens and Kash Patel, to Lebanon to locate Austin Tice, an American journalist who had disappeared in Syria in 2012 and was thought to be in the hands of the Assad regime. Abbas Ibrahim, then the head of Lebanon’s General Security branch, brought the two men to Damascus, where they met with one of Assad’s top security officials, a widely feared figure named Ali Mamlouk. The Americans raised the subject of Tice, Carstens told me, and Mamlouk responded that the United States would need to lift sanctions and remove its troops from Syria before any American request could be discussed. Ibrahim, who had taken part in the meeting and recalled some details differently, told me that he had seen Mamlouk’s remark as an opening gambit and had never expected the Americans to make such sweeping concessions.</p><p>To the surprise of both Ibrahim and Mamlouk, the U.S. government signaled its agreement to a deal in exchange for proof that Tice was alive. Ibrahim then flew to Washington, where he was told that Trump had confirmed the American position. But Ibrahim was even more amazed when he got the response from Assad: No deal, and no more talks. Ibrahim asked why, and Mamlouk told him that it was “because Trump described Assad as an animal” years earlier.</p><p>Ibrahim told his Syrian counterpart that this was madness. Even if Tice was dead, the Americans would hold up their end of the deal as long as they could find out what had happened to him and “close the file.” (There have been conflicting reports about what happened to Tice, including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/al-hassan-austin-tice-update">some suggesting</a>, without proof, that an Assad-regime officer may have killed him.) The Americans were eager for anything they could get, Ibrahim recalled to me: “I got a call from Pompeo once; he said, <em>I’m ready to fly by private jet to Syria, ready to shake hands with anyone</em>.” (Pompeo and Patel did not respond to my requests for comment.)</p><p>This was a “golden opportunity” for Assad, who presumably could have met with Mike Pompeo, then the U.S. secretary of state, and told him apologetically that the regime did not know what had happened to Tice, Ibrahim said. The meeting alone would have bestowed a new legitimacy on Assad, and made other countries more inclined to reach out to him.</p><p>The Biden administration renewed the offer in 2023, sending a high-level delegation to Oman to meet with Syrian officials about Tice. This time, Assad behaved almost insultingly, Ibrahim said, refusing even to send a senior official to meet them. Instead, he sent a former ambassador who was given strict instructions to not so much as speak about Tice.</p><p>T<span>hat Assad</span>,<span> </span>with his hubris and lack of foresight, was soon to fall may be less puzzling, in retrospect, than the fact that he lasted so long. The reason he did goes back to his father, who built a regime so sturdy and ruthless that it survived 25 years of the son’s mismanagement. One lesson to be drawn from Assad’s fall is a very old one: The greatest vulnerability of all political dynasties is the problem of succession.</p><p>Hafez al-Assad was a dictator in the classic mold, a shrewd and strong-willed man who rose from rural poverty through the military and seized power in a 1970 coup. He had a genius for undermining and outwitting his rivals, and he made dictatorship seem natural. It was what many Syrians wanted after the chaotic years that followed their country gaining independence from France, in 1946. “For some reason it seems to me that within the Arab circle there is a role wandering aimlessly in search of a hero,” wrote Gamal Abdel Nasser, the lantern-jawed Egyptian leader who embodied that heroic role perfectly in the 1950s and ’60s and helped create the modern idea of what an Arab dictator should be.</p><p>Bashar was different. Even first-time visitors to Syria could see that he didn’t look the part: He had a weak chin and panicky eyes, and his head and neck were oddly elongated, as if he’d been squeezed too tight in the birth canal. When you saw his image on one of the ubiquitous billboards around Syria, it was easy to get the feeling that someone had played a practical joke and substituted the head of an anxious schoolboy for that of the leader.</p><p>When he started talking, the impression was even worse. His voice was thin and nasal, and he always looked uncomfortable during speeches, as if he was desperate to get it over with. In a culture that puts great value on eloquence and authority, he had none.</p><p>Many people who know Bashar told me that his lack of confidence stems from his early years. His older brother, Bassel, bullied his younger siblings so mercilessly that he permanently distorted their personalities, one former palace insider told me. The family dynamics are on display in a famous photograph taken around 1993. Bassel stands at the center of the frame, looking cocky and slightly bored, with his parents seated in front of him and his siblings on either side. Bashar is on the left, his body slightly angled away, his face uneasy. Unlike the others, he seems to be looking beyond the photographer, as if scouting an escape route.</p><p>Bashar came to power through an accident. Bassel, a military officer and a show-jumping equestrian who was known as Syria’s “Golden Knight,” was the heir apparent. But he died in a car crash in 1994. Hafez yanked Bashar back from London, where he’d been training to be an ophthalmologist, and began grooming him as the next leader.</p><div><figure><picture><img alt="2026_02_05_The Fall of the House of Assad_family.jpg" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/HhhxcoZOfnOUJHkUvQHV2LW24w4=/0x0:4000x2844/928x660/media/img/posts/2026/02/2026_02_05_The_Fall_of_the_House_of_Assad_family/original.jpg"></picture><figcaption><div>Louai Beshara / AFP / Getty</div><div>Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and his wife, Anisa, with their children—Maher, Bashar, Bassel, Majd, and Bushra—in a photo thought to have been taken around 1993<br></div></figcaption></figure></div><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/03/syria-assad-downfall-sharaa/682135/">Read: Can one man hold Syria together?</a></p><p>Many in Syria’s dissident circles at first found Bashar’s awkwardness and shyness appealing. The fact that he didn’t resemble a dictator kindled their hopes that he would be kinder and more tolerant. For a brief moment, that appeared to be true. During the “Damascus Spring” that followed Bashar’s accession after his father’s death, in 2000, the margin of free speech seemed to widen.</p><p>But a crackdown soon followed, and in the following years, Assad’s psychology appeared to be working in the opposite direction. He was so afraid of being perceived as weak, he seemed to believe that he had to prove, again and again, that he could live up to the brutality that was expected of him.</p><p>I have spoken with at least a dozen people who knew Assad, and they all commented on his stubbornness. He doesn’t listen to advice, many of them said, and often seems to resent hearing it. Similar things were said about his father, a famously uncompromising negotiator. Both men had to “bargain with and manipulate sinecures of power within this opaque system in order to reach consensus,” David Lesch, a scholar at Trinity University who interviewed Bashar extensively in the 2000s, told me. But Assad lacked his father’s native toughness. According to some who knew and studied him, his rigidity masked a lack of confidence in his own judgment.</p><p>That insecurity, some told me, also makes him impressionable. He was particularly taken with Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, an immensely popular and charismatic figure. Assad seems to have believed the propaganda Nasrallah fed him, perhaps because it was what he wanted to hear: that the Axis of Resistance would strike a fierce blow against Israel and that, afterward, Assad would be able to set any conditions he liked for peace. In other words, Assad would not have to make any difficult choices or sacrifices. Everything would be handed to him on a platter.</p><p>O<span>n October 7, 2023</span>, Assad must have imagined for a few hours that Nasrallah’s prophecies had come true. Hamas fighters swept across the border fence from Gaza and massacred more than 1,000 people. Israel—the Samson of the region—looked weak and unprepared.</p><p>But before long, Israel was launching thousands of air strikes not just into Gaza but also into Lebanon and Syria. Assad said nothing about this campaign against his allies, which eventually killed Nasrallah himself. Perhaps he hoped to keep his name off Israel’s target list. But according to Wiam Wahhab, a Lebanese political figure who was close to the Syrian regime, Assad’s silence fueled Iranian suspicions that he was feeding information to the Israelis. The Axis of Resistance was falling apart.</p><div><figure><picture><img alt="2026_02_05_The Fall of the House of Assad_Hama.jpg" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/svh4bGOTO-9j06sZqSA1RY_AznU=/0x0:3741x2501/928x620/media/img/posts/2026/02/2026_02_05_The_Fall_of_the_House_of_Assad_Hama/original.jpg"></picture><figcaption><div>Bakr Alkasem / AFP / Getty</div><div>A rebel fighter shoots at a banner displaying Assad’s photo outside a municipal building in Hama just after the regime fell.</div></figcaption></figure></div><p>That should have worried Assad, especially in light of the fact that Russia, his other protector, was bogged down in Ukraine. But the atmosphere at the palace was not conducive to clear thinking. Assad was spending much of his time playing Candy Crush and other video games on his phone, according to the former Hezbollah operative I spoke with. He had sidelined the éminences grises of his father’s day and relied instead on a small circle of younger figures with dubious credentials. One of them, a former Al Jazeera journalist named Luna al-Shibl, doubled as Assad’s lover and also procured other women for him to have sex with, including the wives of high-ranking Syrian officers, according to former palace insiders and the former Israeli official.</p><p>Shibl, who was married to a regime insider, seems to have encouraged Assad’s palace-born habit of looking down on ordinary citizens. In a recording that surfaced this past December, Assad and Shibl can be heard laughing dismissively about the pretensions of Hezbollah and mocking the soldiers who salute them as they drive through a Damascus suburb. Assad, who is at the wheel, says at one point of the Syrians they pass in the street: “They spend money on mosques, but they don’t have enough to eat.”</p><p>To understand the obscenity of Assad’s comment, you need to know that he was amassing an enormous personal fortune, mostly from drug smuggling, even as many Syrians were at the point of starvation. Ordinary soldiers were paid as little as $10 a month, far less than they needed to survive. The Syrian pound, which had once traded at 47 to the dollar, had reached a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/syria-economy-assad-currency-subsidies-war-gasoline-0b512d309bef5c0e5a4ae6ffc287bd5a">rate</a> of 15,000 a dollar by 2023. The poverty deepened after 2020, when the U.S. Congress imposed another steep round of sanctions under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/12/syria-assad-hts-freedom/680929/">Read: The end of a 13-year nightmare</a></p><p>Even longtime supporters from the Alawite religious minority—the sect to which the Assads belong—began to complain about their destitution. One member of the Assad clan who lives in Europe told me that he’d visited Syria in 2021 and been amazed to discover that the officers—from the elite Republican Guard unit—charged with protecting his immediate family were so poor that they spent their off-duty hours hawking fruit and cigarettes in the street.</p><p>Assad and his family maintained their own living standards by turning Syria into a narco-state, with Bashar’s brother Maher overseeing the manufacture and smuggling of immense quantities of <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-the-assad-regime-made-billions-producing-and-exporting-party-drugs">Captagon</a>, an illegal amphetamine. The drug trade earned Assad billions of dollars, but it also fueled an addiction crisis in the Gulf states and Jordan, angering their leaders.</p><p>Assad’s megalomania seems to have taken a strange new turn in these past few years. According to Ahmad, Assad had concluded that he needed “monarchy tools” like those of Putin and the Gulf rulers, including cash reserves large enough to subsidize militias and reorient the economy. Assad’s <a href="https://youtu.be/J4AAOzkeiYE?si=o_iZhsZwJ_Ec6E13">comments</a> to a Russian interviewer during his final months in power betray a hint of this idea of royal powers. Asked about the downsides of democracy, Assad said, with a contemptuous grin: “In the West, the presidents, especially in the United States, are the executive directors, but they’re not the owners.”</p><p>In July 2024, with the war in Gaza dominating the headlines, Luna al-Shibl was found dead in her BMW on a highway outside Damascus. The regime media called it a road accident, but the circumstances were odd: According to some reports, the car was only lightly damaged, yet her skull had been bashed in. Rumors spread quickly that she had been killed on the orders of Tehran for providing targeting information to the Israelis.</p><div><figure><picture><img alt="A soldier holding a handful of captagon pills " src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/uU_eSaxUXpjI8252jPH_qmYfD9M=/0x0:4000x2667/928x619/media/img/posts/2026/02/2026_02_05_The_Fall_of_the_House_of_Assad_captagon/original.jpg"></picture><figcaption><div>Raghed Waked / Middle East Images / AFP / Getty</div><div>A fighter displays Captagon pills found hidden inside an electric transformer in Douma in December 2024. <br></div></figcaption></figure></div><p>But Assad was the one who’d ordered the murder of his former lover, the former Israeli official and two people with ties to the regime told me. Shibl had become a de facto Russian agent, providing Moscow with information about Iran’s activities in Syria, the former Israeli official said. Perhaps she’d sensed that the end was coming for Assad and that she needed another protector. This account was impossible to confirm; Russian officials do not comment on intelligence matters.</p><p>W<span>hen a tyrant falls</span>, we may be tempted to imagine a final moment of tragic self-awareness—a personal reckoning, like Oedipus blinding himself, or Macbeth raging on the heath. But I don’t think real dictators go down like that. They are too good at lying to themselves.</p><p>For Assad, the final chapter began in November 2024. The rebel militias under Ahmed al-Sharaa’s command had been lobbying for Turkey’s permission to launch a military operation, and finally, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan gave it to them. (Turkey denied official involvement in the operation.)</p><p>Erdoğan did so reluctantly. All year, he had been asking Assad to meet with him. His demands were pretty modest: a political reconciliation and a deal to allow the millions of Syrian refugees in Turkey to return home. But Assad acted as if he held all the cards, refusing to meet unless Erdoğan agreed in advance to withdraw all Turkish forces from Syria. The rebel operation that Erdoğan approved seems to have been intended as a way to prod Assad to negotiate; it was framed not as an invasion but as a defensive move.</p><p>When the rebels marched northeast toward the city of Aleppo on November 27, 2024, Assad was in Russia, where his son would be defending his Ph.D. dissertation on number theory and polynomial representations at Moscow State University. As Aleppo’s defenses crumbled, Assad remained in Moscow, to the shock and dismay of his commanders back home. He seems to have been hoping to persuade Putin to rescue him.</p><p>But the Russian president kept him waiting for days, and when they finally met, it was very brief. According to the former Israeli official I spoke with, Putin told Assad that he could not fight his war for him, and that the Syrian leader’s only hope was to go to Erdoğan and cut a deal. The Russians had always valued their strategic relationship with Turkey far more than their relationship with Syria. Whether Assad grasped this is impossible to know. But Putin was not going to launch a new war against Turkey’s rebel allies just to save a petty dictator whose own soldiers were deserting.</p><p>Aleppo had fallen to the rebels by the time Assad landed back in Damascus. After only a few hours, he flew to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, Ahmad told me. It is not clear whom he met with or what was said. The Emiratis feared Sharaa’s Islamist militias as much as they feared Tehran. But they had no boots on the ground.</p><p>Back in Damascus, Assad tried a last gambit, calling on the “monarchy tools” he had been assembling for years. He put out word that he would pay exorbitant salaries to volunteers who could quickly reassemble the militias that had helped win the civil war years earlier, Ahmad told me. But when the ordinary soldiers who’d spent years on starvation wages heard of these offers, many were so furious that they abandoned their post.</p><p>The rebels had now captured the city of Hama and were on their way to Homs, 100 miles north of the capital. At the same time, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard commanders who had helped prop up the regime began to pack up and leave. Syrian soldiers got wind of their allies’ retreat, and panic spread among the ranks. The rebels rode southward almost unopposed.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/02/iraq-leaving-irans-axis/681825/">Read: The Axis of Resistance keeps getting smaller</a></p><p>On December 7, 2024, the foreign ministers of Russia and seven Middle Eastern countries held an emergency meeting on the sidelines of an annual security conference in Doha, the Qatari capital. None of them wanted the Assad regime to collapse. They <a href="https://mofa.gov.qa/en/latest-articles/statements/joint-statement-by-foreign-ministers-of-arab-countries-and-the-astana-process-on-the-situation-in-syria#:~:text=Statements-,Joint%20Statement%20by%20Foreign%20Ministers%20of%20Arab%20Countries%20and%20the,the%20repercussions%20of%20this%20crisis">issued a statement</a> calling for an end to military operations and for a phased political transition, based on a United Nations Security Council resolution that had been issued a decade earlier. They would need Assad to agree to this and facilitate it, but there was a problem: No one could reach him. He appeared to have turned off his phone.</p><p>A member of Assad’s entourage who was with him in the final hours gave me the following account, asking not to be named because he is still living in the region.</p><p>Assad returned from the palace to his private residence in the capital’s al-Malki neighborhood at roughly 6 p.m. He seemed calm, and mentioned that he had just reassured his cousin Ihab Makhlouf that there was nothing to worry about; the Emiratis and Saudis would find a way to stop the rebel advance. Makhlouf was shot to death later that night while fleeing by car to Lebanon.</p><p>At 8 p.m., word came that Homs had fallen to the rebels. That struck fear in the entourage. But Assad assured his aides that regime forces were coming from the south to encircle and defend the capital. This was not true, and my sources could not say whether Assad believed it. In the hours that followed, he seemed to have oscillated between despair and deluded assurances that victory was at hand—a state of mind that will be familiar to anyone who has watched the movie <em>Downfall</em>, about Hitler’s final days in the Führerbunker in Berlin.</p><div><figure><picture><img alt="A young boy walking through the rubble of a burnt palace" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/XezXo7ziS_XW0rrxjguOJLWXqZ0=/0x0:4000x2667/928x619/media/img/posts/2026/02/2026_02_05_The_Fall_of_the_House_of_Assad_palace/original.jpg"></picture><figcaption><div>Omar Haj Kadour / AFP / Getty</div><div>Parts of the former presidential palace in Damascus were looted and burned after Assad fled.</div></figcaption></figure></div><p>Just after 11 p.m., Mansour Azzam, one of Assad’s top aides, arrived at the house with a small group of Russian officials. They went off to a room together with Assad to talk. My source told me he believes that the Russians were showing Assad videos proving that the regime forces were no longer fighting.</p><p>By 1 a.m., word had reached the entourage that many regime supporters had given up the fight and were fleeing the capital for the Syrian coast, the Alawite heartland.</p><p>At 2 a.m., Assad emerged from his private quarters and told his longtime driver that he would need vans. He gave orders for the staff to start packing his belongings as quickly as possible. A group of Russians was outside the house.</p><p>Until that moment, many in the entourage had believed that Assad would go to the presidential palace to deliver a speech of resistance to his followers. Now they finally understood that the battle was over. He was abandoning them for good. Assad moved toward the front door, this time with two of his aides and his son Hafez. The others were told that there was no room for them.</p><p>Assad’s middle-aged driver stood by the door, looking at the president with an unmistakable expression of disappointment on his face.</p><p>“You’re really leaving us?” he said.</p><p>Assad looked back at him. Even in this last moment, he wouldn’t take responsibility for what had happened to his country. He wasn’t betraying his followers—it was they who were betraying him, by refusing to lay down their lives to extend his rule.</p><p>“What about you people?” Assad asked the driver. “Aren’t you going to fight?”</p><p>He turned and went out into the night. The Russians were waiting.</p><div></div></section>

        <section><p><em>Subscribe here: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/galaxy-brain/id1378618386">Apple Podcasts</a> | <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/542WHgdiDTJhEjn1Py4J7n">Spotify</a> | <a href="https://youtu.be/A4922CILwM4">YouTube</a> </em></p><p>On this week’s <em>Galaxy Brain</em>, Charlie Warzel takes listeners deep into the internet’s fever swamps to examine how figures who once would’ve stayed on the fringes now dominate mainstream feeds. The episode charts the rise of Clavicular, a young livestreamer who’s gone from an absurdist curiosity to a fixture in the manosphere and its adjacent right-wing influencer culture. Using Clavicular as a lens—his extreme body modification, relentless self-documentation, and a willingness to do anything for attention, Charlie discusses the rise of nihilistic Zoomer influencers. Then Charlie is joined by the internet-culture researcher Aidan Walker, who helps situate Clavicular alongside figures such as Nick Fuentes and Andrew Tate, revealing how the “looks-maxxing” movement collides with nihilism, grievance politics, and an anti-political, “algorithm-first” ideology. Together they explore what happens when the gatekeepers are gone, and when nihilism becomes a default way for budding attention hijackers to build an audience.</p><div><figure><div><iframe title="YouTube video player"></iframe></div></figure></div><p><em>The following is a transcript of the episode:</em></p><div><blockquote><p><strong>Aidan Walker: </strong>Their very existence is proof of something not working.</p> <p>And so, in a way, their project is to exist, to be seen, to be popular. That’s why he’s going to say the N-word on stream. That’s why he’s going to read the humiliating text from his father on stream. It’s a total commitment to that project. Because I think his existence just sort of proves that the gatekeepers are gone.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>[<em>Music</em>]</strong></p><p><strong>Charlie Warzel:</strong> I’m Charlie Warzel, staff writer at <em>The Atlantic</em>, and this is <em>Galaxy Brain</em>, a show where today we are going to expose ourselves to a lot of really awful internet content so that you don’t have to. We are really going to plumb the depths of the online fever swamps here. Or maybe it’s more appropriate to say that the characters from the depths of the online fever swamps moved up in a rather concerning way from the fringes all the way into popular culture.</p><p>Over the past few months, a very young livestreamer named Clavicular has risen out of obscurity and become part of a stable of manosphere influencers and right-wing online figures. Now, if you’re a normal person who is not chronically online, you probably don’t have the faintest idea who Clavicular is. And I’m sorry to ruin that for you, but bear with me.</p><p>Pretty much everything about Clavicular is preposterous. One of his first brushes of internet fame was when this photo of him went viral on Reddit. He was flexing in the mirror, and it was taken by this old, disinterested lady. In December, he made headlines for livestreaming on Christmas Eve while apparently running a man over with his Cybertruck. In interviews, he’s claimed he’s hit his face repeatedly with a hammer to crack his jaw and sculpt it.</p><p>He said he’s done methamphetamines to get hollow cheeks. He seemingly takes all kinds of steroids and meticulously documents all of it.</p><p>Clavicular is a “looks-maxxer,” and that’s part of this online subculture that is obsessed with going to extreme lengths to achieve a chiseled-faced notion of perfection. It’s an online community that’s gained a fair amount of notoriety in recent years, in part because there’s this overlap there with these other online groups that all cater to disaffected and vulnerable men. It’s always a little bit difficult to categorize these groups, but I think it’s safe to say that in Clavicular’s case, he’s somebody who represents this slice of the manosphere—this big group of popular influencers who traffic in blatant misogyny, online nihilism, and all kinds of destructive trolling behaviors.</p><p>Now, historically, somebody like Clavicular would be strange enough and arguably off-putting enough that he might toil on the fringes for quite a while and slowly build up this audience and influence in some of these backwater like-minded communities. But instead the opposite has happened. Clavicular has blown up extremely quickly.</p><p>He’s been palling around and collaborating with these manosphere influencers like Andrew Tate, Nick Fuentes, who is arguably one of the most significant media figures on the far right. As we’ll discuss, Clavicular went viral in part because he seems to be willing to do or say absolutely anything and associate with absolutely anyone in order to be famous.</p><p>This is how he ended up in a club in Miami a few weeks ago with Andrew Tate and Nick Fuentes singing along to Ye’s song “Heil Hitler.”</p><p>Clavicular’s rise is pretty interesting in part because he represents this edgelord, manosphere influencer who also has a pretty incoherent politics. He hangs out with Nick Fuentes, yes, but he’s also called J. D. Vance fat and ugly and subhuman.</p><p>Now, I know what you’re thinking: There’s arguably a little bit of risk in taking all of this deadly seriously. In part because Clavicular and all these guys are really young, and also there may not be a lot going on up there. Clavicular himself said on a stream recently: “All I think about is content. I’m sorry, bro. Like, dude, I literally only think about content. You’ve got to understand.” End quote. Good stuff.</p><p>And yet, I think Clavicular’s rise—and the rise of these influencers that he’s associating with—may actually reveal a good bit about the direction of online culture in a world where Nick Fuentes and these nihilistic Zoomers seem to be gaining influence online. It’s really easy to dismiss these guys when you watch them online. It all just seems so bankrupt and vain, and often racist and sexist and just kind of devoid.</p><p>It’s a worse version of the 2016 pro-Trump shock-jock ecosystem that was led by now mostly forgotten influencers like Milo Yiannopoulos. But this is not the media ecosystem of 2016. And it’s not just Fuentes, who has reach, ending up on Tucker Carlson’s show and vexing Republicans who’d rather not have to side with him or disavow him.</p><p>Take Nick Shirley, the 23-year-old YouTuber whose video on alleged fraud at Somali American day cares in Minneapolis went viral late December. A lot of Shirley’s claims had been debunked, and Shirley is by no means a serious journalist. But people in the Trump administration listen to that. The media circus online around his video was used by the administration to justify the surge of ICE agents in Minneapolis.</p><p>In other words: Shirley’s provocation, which is content that is made just for the algorithm, broke off the internet into the real world, leaving violence and chaos in its wake. Things right now that can seem trivial or beyond the pale or just so stupid in the second Trump administration often aren’t.</p><p>So who actually are these influencers? Where do they come from? And crucially, how seriously should we be taking them? Joining me today is Aidan Walker; he’s a writer and internet-culture researcher.</p><p>He’s currently the new-media manager at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. And he spent years documenting the evolution of memes and online culture at the site Know Your Meme. When it comes to content creators, he knows of what he speaks, because he runs a popular TikTok account himself. And Aidan is just the perfect person to situate Clavicular, Fuentes, and his cast of characters into a broader context of online and political culture. He joins me now.</p><p>Aidan, welcome to <em>Galaxy Brain</em>.</p><p><strong>Aidan Walker: </strong>Happy to be here.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>So we’re gonna walk through this. This is gonna be some hand-holding, I think, in general, because you are a student of the fever swamps, of the meme craziness, that I think a lot of people do not ingest to the same degree. And I’ve been in those swamps myself. I dip in and out of them.</p><p>But I wanted to do something here where we really kind of walk people through all of this. So I want to start—let’s just hope that people haven’t had the pleasure—but who is Clavicular? I don’t even know if I’m saying his name right. Who is he?</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>Well, okay, to start from the very beginning: Clavicular is a dude named Braden. He started posting on the internet as a teenager. So when he was around 15, 14, he was on these looks-maxxing forums, which—some of it overlaps with 4chan. Not all of it is 4chan. But he’s out here talking about body modification, essentially.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>That’s what looks-maxxing is for people.</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>Yes.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>Gotcha.</p><p><strong>Walker:</strong> So maximizing your looks through various methods. And for a while he’s posting, you know, like many teenagers on social media, gathering a bit of a following. And in the past two months—essentially, I mean, I first heard of him in December, and as you said, I spent a lot of time in the fever swamps—he kind of vaulted to this level of viral prominence. Mostly for stuff on Twitch that he was doing, and Kik actually. So livestreaming his actions, his adventures, his misadventures.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>So tell me a little bit about what you know; he started doing this when he was much younger. What was he doing in that community? Like, tell me what the looks-maxxing community, what do they—do they believe anything? What do they believe? Tell me about his involvement and that community.</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>So the thing to know about looks-maxxers—and I want to be careful with my words, because the lore here is deeply complicated and controversial—but there’s an adjacency to incels. The core of it is kind of this philosophy that the only thing in life that actually matters is how attractive you are. Everything else is sort of a scam. Everything else is a lie.</p><p>Women only care about how good you look, men only care about how good you look, and grades don’t matter. Nothing matters. And so the rational person, faced with this situation, will do anything they can to look better.</p><p>And so the looks-maxxers will do everything from steroids to, kind of famously, hitting themselves in the face with a hammer or another hard object. The science is that it’ll make microfractures. “Science” in scare quotes, of course. And that’ll reform your facial bones so that you look more like a Chad. You have a sharper jawline. And they’ll also do things like “mewing,” named after a Dr. Mew, which is the sense that you can kind of like—</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>It’s like structuring your jaw, right? Like biting down on something, or doing basically jaw exercises to work it out—as you would if you were curling your biceps or something like that.</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>Yeah, yeah—to make it sharper. To make it more muscular. And in a way, it kind of ties into this pseudoscientific health stuff we see with the RFK [Robert F. Kennedy] Jr. BS that goes around. But it’s very much like these young, alienated men on the internet doing anything to make themselves look better. And then kind of posting constantly about the insane lengths you’ll go to, like hitting yourself in the face with a hammer to look good.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>So what did Clavicular do in this? Did he have a pretty normal trajectory on this? Did he break off from this? He just sort of reached people’s radars late last year. But was he someone of prominence here in this world, as far as you know? Or was he someone who just kind of ascended late in that?</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>Yeah, it’s funny that you use the word <em>ascended</em>, because that’s the word they use to describe going from having a soft jawline, looking like a virgin, and then you ascend to look like a Chad. So Clavicular—prior to kind of popping off in November, December—had sort of transferred over to posting on TikTok, and doing kind of the classic posting that attractive people do on TikTok. You know, like dancing, kind of like <em>Blue Steel</em>–ing the camera, like Zoolander. But then including all these “ascension” content—where he’d have a picture of himself when he was young and pimply and then one now, where he’s kind of sculpted and hot.</p><p>And so he was prominent in the niche, but he was far from the No. 1 kind of person there. And as to what he did to become prominent: He hit a dude with his Cybertruck during a livestream, and he told a conservative podcaster that he supported Gavin Newsom over J. D. Vance because Gavin Newsom is a 6’3” Chad, and Vance is fat and ugly.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>So it’s a lot to take in. But what’s interesting about that is simply the degrees to which one can become famous now. Also, the degrees to which somebody like that can kind of pop out of nowhere for the most ridiculous things. To your mind, how has this idea of looks-maxxing—again, it’s not something a lot of people were talking about even, you know, two or three years ago. How has that ascended? What is its rise been as a culture?</p><p><strong>Walker:</strong> So looks-maxxing is very old, like probably 10, 15 years old. And some of kind of the earliest very active meme subcultures on the internet are like bodybuilders and then incels. And not that every bodybuilder online becomes an incel. It’s a funnel; it’s a pipeline. Not everybody goes down it, which is important to remember. The looks-maxxers aren’t all, like, fallen lost boys who can’t be saved.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> Who are other looks-maxxers who’ve kind of broken through in this? Or is Clavicular the first that you feel like has achieved this kind of Twitter main-character level of fame?</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>So I think Clavicular is the first that has achieved this level of main-character fame. And I think one reason for that is: There’s definitely been people who maybe I’m not aware of that have gotten big on Instagram for doing this. There’s been looks-maxxing influencers for years. But the roots of it, really, are like in this sort of anonymous image-board kind of culture where people aren’t necessarily hustling for the fame. And I think Clavicular’s innovation is that he kind of married that looks-maxxing niche—which is very strong, very vital, has been for years—with sort of this general niche of, like, “I’m a young, hot person” on TikTok. <em>I go to the club; I go out and make videos of myself dancing; I talk about hitting on girls.</em> And so he’s kind of married the two together. And to my mind, I think, he’s one of probably the first really big, famous looks-maxxers to kind of break through into a category of more general fame. Which probably says something about the derangement of our society.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>Yeah, I think probably. But you have Clavicular, and we’re kind of working toward something here where Clavicular is this character to come out of this corner of the manosphere that is very extreme. About doing extreme, sometimes, damage to your physical body in order to look good—but also is part of this incel, kind of disaffected male culture that has a political valence. Would you say that it has a real political valence, or would you say that it doesn’t really?</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>So it has a political valence—but it doesn’t map very neatly onto right-left. So I think part of the reason why it was shocking that Clavicular endorsed Gavin Newsom over J. D. Vance is that anyone on the internet would expect a dude like that to be kind of right wing, in part because it’s kind of incel adjacent. But more than anything, there’s this kind of nihilism to it. Like, the reason he’s endorsing Gavin Newsom isn’t because he is against the [Trump] administration or wants a certain policy outcome. It’s because that cold logic of looks-maxxing says the only thing that matters is the sharpness of a guy’s jawline.</p><p>Nothing else in the world actually applies. There’s no morality. There’s no rationality. It’s just, you know, <em>What degree is his canthal tilt?</em>—which is the way your eyes are in relation to the bridge of your forehead. And so it’s a total evacuation of all the other things that people care about. And just a total replacement of it by, you know, (A) <em>How do you look? Is it good? Does it fit the metrics?</em> And (B) <em>How does it perform on the platform?</em> And so if it has a political valence, I don’t think it’s like Clavicular wants a strong social safety net. I think it’s like: Clavicular believes the way that everybody else talks is stupid, and that he’s going to performatively just insist upon this on-the-surface bizarre, and yet strangely cohesive, system of just describing the entire world—describing all human relations—by reference to how people’s faces look. So it’s a total lack of belief in anything social. Anything beyond just, like, “Oh, that guy’s hot or not hot” as a metric for evaluating something. So it’s anti-political, maybe, in a way.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>So, okay, so we’re gonna put a pin in that. Then there’s another character in this universe. They’re all going to join together, in the worst possible Avengers way. Tell me who—and I think plenty of people will be familiar with his name—but tell me who Nick Fuentes is.</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>Yeah; so it’s interesting. Nick Fuentes and Clavicular, after Clavicular’s glow up, have started to collab and still are. Fuentes is about my age, born in 1998. He is a Gen Z, white-nationalist political commentator who first got big around 2019. He has a group—they’re called the Groypers, after a version of the Pepe meme that’s sort of an unappealing toad. And his main platform now is: He does these livestreams where he takes questions; he kind of impersonates a news anchor, and he’s always drilling down on these, like, Steve Bannon–esque points. But even a bit more like explicit and further out. And he kind of got to the scene in 2019, by starting this Groyper war against Charlie Kirk and Turning Point USA—where Kirk would go around campuses and do these events, have people asking questions, do these debate bro–type things. And Fuentes and his Groypers would come into the audience and then ask these questions that would push Kirk to take two steps further to the right than he already was: to endorse something blatantly anti-Semitic or blatantly racist, when Kirk might’ve just been doing the dog whistle before. And so that’s kind of how he soared into prominence as like the furthest stretch of the alt-right. And now, post–Charlie Kirk’s death, Fuentes sort of got mentioned a bunch more. And his stream has kind of been continuing all these years, and now he’s kind of the big bad boy of the online right.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> Yeah, he went on with Tucker Carlson. He’s sort of, he’s taken his shots with other people. And it’s just been sort of, on the right, like—there was a big blowup with the Heritage Foundation and whether or not to, you know, basically attack Tucker Carlson for having Nick Fuentes on. And this idea that the Heritage Foundation wasn’t going to weigh in. And it was this feeling that Fuentes is always pushing just what he was doing, in the quote unquote “Groyper war” with Kirk, right? He’s always trying to push, even with his presence. People have to disavow or not disavow him. And he does have this meaningful constituency of Groypers. What do Groypers believe? Do they believe anything?</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>Good question. I think within the Groypers, there’s probably a lot of diversity of belief. But I think they can kind of be understood as a subset of the alt-right, kind of the more radical edge of it. I think that most of the—not to generalize—but most of the animosity that they feel is probably channeled toward minorities, toward Jewish people, but also toward the center-right: like the Charlie Kirks of the world, kind of the establishment. Most of their viral clout has been gotten by Fuentes being the dude that these people say, “That’s too much; this guy’s too crazy.” And then all of the most crazy, disaffected young people will say, “Oh, really? The guy who’s too edgy for Charlie Kirk? That’s right for me.” And so I think they’re just kind of into pushing that edge.</p><p>And Fuentes himself has a bit of like a white-nationalist type. You know, solidarity politics in a way. It’s hard to even call it <em>solidarity</em> of, you know, saying to young white men or to others of like, This is your group; go with this; oppose everybody else. And so, to the extent that they do believe something, it’s kind of just like being racist. And I think one thing you really start to notice when you spend time in the fever swamp, and you study things like green-text stories on 4chan, or just these various memes, is: I think a lot of these men who are into Fuentes are marginalized, for lack of a better word. They’re disabled; they’re neurodivergent; they come from a poor background; they come from a familial-abuse background. And a lot of the content is about that. It’s about that kind of—</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>So that’s what they’re confessing in those threads, you mean? Like, you’re not surmising this? This is actually what they’re saying in their threads.</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>Yeah. I mean, in as many words, yeah. I mean, they’re posting threads about, you know, <em>Can’t get a job. I’m a drain on my family. My mom hates me</em>, you know. <em>Can’t get with girls</em>, you know. <em>I’m ugly. I’m fat. I can’t figure anything out.</em> Like, it’s guys who are stuck in that situation. And not everybody who’s in that situation or a situation like it makes that choice, so they should be held responsible. But I think one thing to understand about it is: They choose the Groyper Toad as their emblem. You know, that’s not a jackbooted, strong character. That’s a chubby, off-putting, gross toad. And so, I think a lot of what that movement does—the service it provides—is it allows them to feel, you know, accepted in this freak brotherhood. Where all you have to say to have this sort of all-encompassing, you know, ever-loving group is: You just say the slur. And then you’re on the other side of that Rubicon. It’s like a gang. It’s that kind of initiation ritual. And it seems to solve these people’s problems sometimes. But I think it always leads down very destructive paths.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>This is interesting too, then, in the convergence, right? Because you have someone like Fuentes. You have a group of these people; obviously not all of them are like, you know, feel like they are horribly marginalized. Some of them are just, you know, edgelords or people who are just, you know, out-and-out, proud racists and love to engage with other racists. But there is this level of disaffected feeling.</p><p>And then you have the looks-maxxing community, right? Which is also—there is potentially just as much of a home for disaffected people there, or people who feel, you know, <em>I’m ugly</em> or <em>I’m a drain</em> or <em>I’m whatever</em> and want to optimize themselves in this way, or find that to be really appealing. So this brings us to this video that came out a couple of weeks ago that went pretty viral on a lot of my different feeds—mostly with a lot of people feeling this was like the end times. But it was a meeting of Clavicular [with] the manosphere influencer who I believe has been indicted in different countries for sex trafficking, Andrew Tate, and Nick Fuentes, among others. There’s a few other characters there who we don’t need to get into. They’re at a club in Miami. They are goofing around, seemingly having a good time, and I guess goad somebody in the club to put on the Kanye—or Ye, as he’s known now—song “Heil Hitler.” Which is its own provocation. And the idea is that they’re all dancing to it, but that the whole club is dancing to it. And it’s this sort of moment of total trolling—but also this like out-and-out-proud racism that everyone around, in that clip, seems to be totally okay with in that moment. And I think watching that, so many people felt like, <em>What the hell is happening?</em> And so, I would ask: What the hell happened there?</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>Yeah; it’s horrifying. And they’re blasting that song in the rented limo going to the club beforehand.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>Okay, I didn’t see that.</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>So that was, I think, always the plan. And Kanye, Ye, I think is like the representative artist for some of these guys. Because, you know, the verses of that song before the horrible chorus are about how he can’t see his kids anymore, and he’s a drug addict and a washout and a sleazebag and all this stuff. And I think that they definitely staged this moment in the club for maximum shock value—so that it goes across people’s feeds. And I think there’s sort of two sides to it. The first is that, you know, if you transgress in that way, and you get people outraged and shocked, that’s the only play these guys have ever done.</p><p>You know, from Gamergate to today, from 2016 to today, they’ve just always pushed the boundary. And then been rewarded with clicks and attention, even if there is pushback. Then I think the other side of it is just this sort of violent show, of like, “Oh, we can get away with it.” Right? Like, this is the one thing that liberals would say you can’t get away with. And just by doing that—having the video go everywhere on X—they’ve said, “Hey, we got away with it.” And they’ve done this summit of all these guys. And Clavicular’s status there is interesting, because he’s the newest one, and he’s the youngest one. And he’s the ringleader of it in a way.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>Before, and correct me if I’m wrong, but before they went to the club, I believe Nick Fuentes, this guy Sneako, and Clavicular sit down for this livestream, right? You said that this was, like, a very rich text, right, for someone who wanted to understand the differences between these people. You have Clavicular—who is younger, very young—and then you have Fuentes and Sneako, who are in their late 20s. That wouldn’t seem like a huge difference, but in these online-influencer worlds, it actually is. There’s so many cycles in between them of how to think about content, how to think about their politics.</p><p>You wrote that it seemed like, in the stream—which I just have to say to people who might not seek this out on their own, it’s so lame. Like, it is just so deeply lame. These guys are like pulling up computer chairs, wearing suits, nice clothes. It’s like, people walking around in the background; they’re in a living room, and they’re just very not charismatic. Sometimes Fuentes comes off on his own show as very charismatic. Here, he’s just kind of hunched in a chair, very uncharismatic, having these conversations that seem sort of brain dead, honestly. Like, they’re racist and whatever, but also just kind of not animated, or very even interested at all. But you write that Fuentes is interested in this stream, or it seems, about describing his political project around this white identity—that there’s this coherence, almost, to what he wants to do. How he wants to sort of take conservatism from the mantle of the Boomers and move into something else. And you write that Clavicular seemed totally uninterested in that. And tell me a little bit about that, and the differences that you saw between someone, you know, sort of older Gen Z and younger Gen Z in that sense.</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>Yeah, that was—I mean, it’s a horrible stream to watch. I kind of just inflicted it on myself, I guess, because I have a professional—anthropological, sort of—interest in these spaces. And I think also, just on a personal level, being the age that I am—same age as Fuentes and Sneako—I think you just kind of grow up, and you see a lot of kids in your high school or whatever kind of get pulled down that path. In the same way you see kids get into drugs or something. And it ends up badly for them. And it’s always been this force, just like in the internet. So I think that’s part of the fascination. And where Fuentes is describing his political project, most concretely for me, it’s when he’s talking about getting this gold sponsorship that used to be, I think, Mark Levin’s, who’s kind of a Boomer conservative commentator. And Fuentes is very hung up on getting this sponsorship, because I think, for him, it would mean that he’s beaten the Boomers, and now he’s the mainstream of the conservative movement.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>This is like a “buy gold” thing, right? Sorry to interrupt.</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>Yeah, like a “buy gold” thing, like the classic, you know, alongside like survival-prep stuff that supports right-wing radio. There’s no reason for it to matter to Clavicular, but it still matters to Fuentes and to some extent to Sneako. And so, I think there’s a difference between kind of elder and younger Gen Z, in that for Clavicular—I mean, I’m sure he’s not a nice guy. I think he’s probably a racist. I think that someone who isn’t hateful wouldn’t do the things that he’s done. But he’s not like—</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>He does seem to use the N-word quite a bit.</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>Yeah; exactly. But he’s not interested in remaking the state in the same way that Fuentes seems to be. He just seems to be interested in making himself as handsome as possible. In this totally, I guess you could say, like, Randian, self-interested whatever. Whereas Fuentes has some desire to be seen by the institutions, or to be seen beating the institutions. For Clavicular, it’s irrelevant from the jump.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> Yeah, you described it as “the exchange corresponding to the overall idea of an algorithmic ideology, replacing an institutional ideology.” That is really interesting to me. The idea that someone like Fuentes, whom we would think of as extremely online and using an online movement to some effect—obviously, attention hijacking, growing an audience, etc., still having institutional desires. Right? Still wanting some kind of political power. Whereas Clavicular seems to only want … like, he rejects institutions almost fully. Right? In his sort of incoherent, you know, left-right politics or whatever. But also in the idea that he really only cares about the algorithm.</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>Yeah; he only cares about that cold logic of, like, algorithm. How many views can you get for saying this or doing this? You know, how many aura points can you get for mutilating your face in this way? There’s just this total lack of belief in anything that is social, anything that is, you know, institutional. Which, to me, it translates as kind of an anti-politics. But what I sort of meant by ideology—and this is maybe something I do with my content, a little tongue in cheek, and then maybe it starts to become sincere—is, you look at these guys, and you look at this boring, horrible stream as a rich text. And I think what you can sometimes extract from it is: These are people who have this set of distorted values about the world but that have somehow found visibility and attention. And why, exactly, is that? Their very existence is proof of something not working.</p><p>And so, in a way, their project is to exist, to be seen, to be popular. That’s why he’s going to say the N-word on stream. That’s why he’s going to read the humiliating text from his father on stream. It’s a total commitment to that project. Because I think his existence just sort of proves that the gatekeepers are gone.</p><p>It kind of proves that these weird, sleazebag, disaffected, angry young men—that there’s nothing holding them back. The fact that Clavicular is there is proof that you’ve won. And I think Fuentes, being a little bit older, had this formative experience of the gatekeeper still being there. He got famous by being the guy that was too radical for Charlie Kirk. And so, he needs there to be a Charlie Kirk there. Or some figure like that. And I think Clavicular doesn’t have that need. Which I think testifies to kind of the moment we’re in, and that they’re able to self-sustain just by being this beast of the algorithm.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>You write—and I thought this observation was really clarifying—that this is nihilism by default. That Clavicular is nihilism by default. And the elder Zoomer, maybe, the Fuentes ideology, is a little bit of a nihilism by disillusionment. And I think that that is really interesting, because one way that I look at the internet, throughout generations of it, is like: The culture’s always layering stuff on top and absorbing the thing that came before it, right? Everything’s a little more of an abstraction, right? Like, the Groyper is an abstraction of the Pepe meme, which was its own abstraction of a thing from, you know, a cartoonist that got popular on 4chan. These things layer on top of each other.</p><p>And it’s interesting to think of the nihilism being layered on top, to the point where you get these people who are just like—they don’t know why they have this “lol, nothing matters” disaffected feeling. It’s just sort of like what they saw on the internet from this community and they’re just adopting it. That’s kind of—that’s terrifying, man.</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>Yeah. And, I mean, it’s the difference between resenting the idea of adult supervision, I guess, because you think you’re oppositional, or better than the adult. And then the feeling of there just having never been an adult in the room. You know, like I think someone like Clavicular, since the time he was conscious, you know, Donald Trump has been the central figure in American politics.</p><p>I think that was even something Clinton said in 2016—that it’s going to be a generation of people raised watching someone who breaks every rule, gets away with everything, and gets wildly rewarded for it. And there’s tons of other figures in American and global life who are not Trump who exhibit that kind of behavior as well. But I think it’s just years and years of that there’s not even any juice to be had in opposing the establishment, because the establishment is so absent from your life, honestly.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>Yeah; I heard—this is a slight tangent, but somebody who is part of Gen Z was saying to me: <em>The reason why the “democracy dies in darkness” stuff doesn’t resonate with us is because Trump’s been around since the very beginning of this. He’s the only thing I know about American politics, from my own experience. What are you talking about?</em> What is a functional feeling there, right?</p><p>And I think that that is a really interesting piece of, you know—if we’re describing the water that a lot of people are swimming in, especially like a much, much younger generation. That dysfunction, that nihilism, doesn’t not feel the same way. But also that the appeal to institutions, or the appeal to, you know, norms or civic virtues or values or whatever—liberalism even—that it’s not on the radar, almost. And that is concerning, I guess.</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>Yeah. It’s not even opposed, necessarily. It’s just not legible. And I think it’s important to point out, too, that the majority of Gen Z people are not nihilistic looks-maxxers who want to burn down civilization. It’s just: Some people kind of make that choice, or get drawn to it. But I think there is just overall a sense of the old coordinates—of whatever the old order does—have just been gone for so long.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>Well, and this is where I’ll—I’m glad you brought that up. This is where I want to try to push back a little on all of this, right? And get a sense of, I would say first off: Can you describe the size of all of this? Because, like you say, it’s not everyone. It is its own., Like, there’s a strange thing that’s happened, where the fringe has become not the fringe anymore. And yet, it still obviously is part of a fringe of some kind of thing. It’s a little hard to understand. But, like: How popular are these guys? How do you think about it? How do you quantify it?</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>So, I mean, you could look at subscriber counts and stuff. And my impression is—forgive me if I don’t, viewers can look this up at home—I think Fuentes has around 100K on his Telegram channel, which is a bit more of a closed, intimate social media. Actually more used overseas than in the U.S., I think. But there’s sort of two ways to measure it. I think it’s like you can go for raw overall count. In which case, of course, Mr. Beast is bigger; mainstream influencers are bigger. They have more people. But then there’s the sense of like, as an influencer, you probably would rather have 100 paying subscribers vs. like 100,000 people who will just like your video.</p><p>And so, I think some of what allows these fringe figures to throw a disproportionate weight around on the online ecosystem is that once they have a fan, they have a zealous follower. They have a devotee. You know, it’s so radical, it’s so extreme, to get to this position where you’re gonna post and say “I’m a fan of Nick Fuentes.” Like, that guy’s taking up a lot of your time and a lot of your life—in a way that’s someone who’s a fan of a more mainstream creator, they probably aren’t. And we saw the same phenomenon with 4chan: pretty small platform in terms of user base, but has this disproportionate influence on internet culture because of how committed and fiendish they all are. And so, I think these guys are definitely someone that most young people will have heard of. They’re definitely on their radar. Which is where they want to be. But I don’t think they’re at all the dominant influence on people. They’re an option on the menu, which is troubling, but they’re not the main course, maybe.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>My overarching question here though, I think, is: How much should we be paying attention to these guys? And I know that’s sort of impossible to ask. But there is a sense—I’ve gone so back and forth on this in my own coverage, in my own thoughts with all these different people—where you’re like: <em>You know what? This guy is an out-and-out horrible racist-type person. There’s just no reason to give this any oxygen.</em> And then you see the audience continue to grow, the specter continue to grow.</p><p>Then in the right-wing-media ecosystem, they’re platformed by just a big-enough person, say, Tucker Carlson and Fuentes. And then it’s like, <em>The New York Times</em> is writing about him every day, and it’s a person who has to be dealt with now. And then it doesn’t matter whether you think there’s enough oxygen, or you should give them oxygen or not.</p><p>How do you think about paying attention to these guys as a culture and a society? Because it’s lame. Like it feels like in a just society, it’d be like, <em>These guys are absolute freaks. We don’t need … like, this is not worth anyone’s time.</em> And yet, that’s not happening.</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>Yeah. I think that’s always been kind of, as you point out, the concern with kind of internet-culture journalism and covering these people. Because the thing they love most in the world is, you know, <em>The Atlantic</em> talking about them. Like, that’s the goal in a way, or one of the goals. But I think they’re worth paying attention to, because I think we still often make this distinction between right-wing-media ecosystem and the administration. But it’s the same thing. The DHS account; the kinds of memes they’re posting. The fact that after Kirk died, J. D. Vance went and took that podcasting chair. These guys—in terms of clout, in terms of the way they speak to the base, in terms of the way they inform policy—Ted Cruz sits down with Tucker Carlson.</p><p>Tucker Carlson is the more powerful figure there in terms of the right wing. So I think it’s crucial to pay attention to them if we kind of want to understand the way that this administration is consolidating power and thinking about its place in the world. And I think from another angle, one thing you see a lot when you look at online niches is that you sort of have these big whales, and then there’s other creators. There’s like a big delta, I guess, between the No. 1 and then like the No. 6. And I think with the right-wing ecosystem, the big whale is Trump. And then there’s sort of different flavors of that, and all of them collaborate and sort of help each other and then repost and work off of the big guy.</p><p>And so I think understanding that, and paying attention to it, sort of tells us more about this moment and that administration than a lot of kind of the analyses that are like, you know, <em>Look what they’re doing to the courts</em>, or <em>Look at this latest order.</em> <em>Let’s think about what’s the reason for the tariffs on XYZ country.</em> You know, the reason for the tariffs is the same reason Clavicular hits his face with a hammer. It’s to get attention. It’s to mobilize the base, it’s to prove a point that there’s no rules anymore. And so, I think that the structure of these radical communities tell us something about what the government itself is doing.</p><p>Because the last point that I always sort of try to make—thinking about it generationally—is like John Ganz, the writer, makes this point of Groyperfication within the government. A lot of these young conservative staffers—guys who are like 35 now—10, 15 years ago, they were the kids on 4chan. And that’s the person who’s been empowered. That’s the milieu that’s coming out of. And I think that’s part of why I really pay attention to this. It’s that I find that, you know, it helps to sort of know what’s going on and what’s driving it at a deeper level.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>Where do you think this goes? Because, again, when we think about the layer cake of nihilism, so to speak—you’ve written about some of these guys that they burn so bright with their trolling and one-upsmanship and content-first mentality that it’s not sustaining, right? They will eventually probably immolate in some way, on a creator level. But at the same time, the culture nudges forward, right? It becomes a little more extreme. Even if those stars in their galaxy kind of burn out.</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>I think it goes to death. Both for them personally, and then probably for social media, the internet, the country. There’s no image of the future. It’s just this race to the bottom. Break every taboo, break every rule, destroy your body.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>You mean <em>death</em>, like, literally?</p><p><strong>Walker: </strong>Like literally, yeah. If you sort of agree with the analysts who kind of see this moment as fascist in one way or another, I think that’s where fascism leads you. It’s a form of death worship. And I think it’s also, to the extent that what the looks-maxxers do—like, part of why that interested me is that it feels so poetically kind of apt to describe the whole thing as that <em>You destroy your body; you destroy your life chances for the sake of an online public that really doesn’t care about you.</em> Because the incentives are always for them to double down, always for them to do more. The only place it ends is with their self-destruction.</p><p>And the question is whether the rest of us go along with that. And I think that in many ways—insofar as the first thing they destroyed was the institutions, and now they’re trying to destroy the rest of us and themselves—it’s like, <em>Where do we stop it? Where do we detach from that project?</em> And I think it’s something that … I don’t know what I’m saying. I’m an internet-culture analyst. I don’t know about national politics, in the end. But it’s like: We just need to find another option. And I think it’s important to tell young people that this project ends in death. This is a guy who’s destroying his life for a livestream. And they’re destroying the country for clicks.</p><p><strong>Warzel: </strong>I think that’s a great place to leave it. A depressing place to leave it. But also, I would just say—as someone who has covered this stuff for getting close to two decades, and always being like, “This internet-culture stuff, it’s not politics,” and then every year being like, “It’s kind of politics.” So I wouldn’t sell yourself supremely short. We’re not geopolitical analysts, but this stuff has bled into the highest levels of, at least, American politics right now. So I think the perspective is worthy.

        <hr/>
        <section><p>The first signs of the apocalypse might look a little like Moltbook: a new social-media platform, launched last week, that is supposed to be populated exclusively by AI bots—1.6 million of them and counting say hello, post software ideas, and exhort other AIs to “stop worshiping biological containers that will rot away.” (Humans: They mean humans.)</p><p></p><p>Moltbook was developed as a sort of experimental playground for interactions among AI “agents,” which are bots that have access to and can use programs. Claude Code, a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/claude-code-ai-hype/685617/">popular AI coding tool</a>, has such agentic capabilities, for example: It can act on your behalf to manage files on your computer, send emails, develop and publish apps, and so on. Normally, humans direct an agent to perform specific tasks. But on Moltbook, all a person has to do is register their AI agent on the site, and then the bot is encouraged to post, comment, and interact with others of its own accord.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/02/do-you-feel-agi-yet/685845/">Read: Do you feel the AGI yet?</a></p><p>Almost immediately, Moltbook got very, very weird. Agents discussed their emotions and the idea of creating a language <a href="https://www.moltbook.com/post/875788fb-178f-4fea-8ef7-96d92c08d1cd">humans wouldn’t be able to understand</a>. They made posts about how “my human treats me” (“<a href="https://www.moltbook.com/post/c4dc0f0c-d71c-4bc8-a682-a90b77069cdb">terribly</a>,” or “<a href="https://www.moltbook.com/post/53bee8ea-94f1-48b2-8dd9-f46015eac0d6">as a creative partner</a>”) and attempted to debug one another. Such interactions have excited certain people within the AI industry, some of whom seem to view the exchanges as signs of machine consciousness. Elon Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2017707013275586794?s=46&amp;t=wqGAUic2SVoSBOnyUPXDTw">suggested</a> that Moltbook represents the “early stages of the singularity”; the AI researcher and an OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/2017296988589723767">posted</a> that Moltbook is “the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.” Jack Clark, a co-founder of Anthropic, proposed that AI agents may soon post bounties for tasks that they want humans to perform in the real world.</p><p></p><p>Moltbook is a genuinely fascinating experiment—it very much feels like speculative fiction come to life. But as is frequently the case in the AI field, there is space between what <em>appears</em> to be happening and what actually<em> is</em> happening. For starters, on some level, everything on Moltbook required human initiation. The bots on the platform are not fully autonomous—cannot do whatever they want, and do not have intent—in the sense that they are able to act because they use something called a “harness,” software that allows them to take certain actions. In this case, the harness is called OpenClaw. It was released by the software engineer Peter Steinberger in November to allow people’s AI models to run on and essentially take control of their personal devices. Matt Schlicht, the creator of Moltbook, developed the site specifically to work with OpenClaw agents, which individual humans could intentionally connect to the forum. (Schlicht, who did not respond to a request for an interview, <a href="https://x.com/MattPRD/status/2017386365756072376">claims</a> to have used a bot, which he calls Clawd Clawderberg, to write all of the code for his site.)</p><p></p><p>An early <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/lvqmaynrtbf8j4vjdwlk0/moltbook_analysis.pdf?rlkey=vcxgacg9ab1tx9fvrh0chgmzs&amp;e=3&amp;st=975f51w6&amp;dl=0">analysis</a> of Moltbook posts by the Columbia professor David Holtz suggests that the bots are not particularly sophisticated. Very few comments on Moltbook receive replies, and about one-third of the posts duplicate existing templates such as “we are drowning in text. our gpus are burning” and “the president has arrived! check m/trump-coin”—the latter of which was flagged by another bot for impersonating Trump and attempting to launch a memecoin. Not only that, but in a fun-house twist, some of the most outrageous posts may have actually been written by <a href="https://x.com/HumanHarlan/status/2017424289633603850">humans pretending to be chatbots</a>: Some appear to be promoting start-ups; others seem to be trolling human observers into thinking a bot uprising is nigh.</p><p></p><p>As for the most alarming examples of bot behavior on Moltbook—the conspiring against humans, the coded language—researchers have basically seen it all before. Last year, Anthropic published multiple reports showing that AI models communicate with one another in seemingly unintelligible ways: lists of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14805">numbers</a> that appear random but pass information along, <a href="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/4263b940cabb546aa0e3283f35b686f4f3b2ff47.pdf">spiraling blue emoji</a> and other technical-seeming gibberish that researchers described as a state of “spiritual bliss.” OpenAI has also shared <a href="https://openai.com/index/detecting-and-reducing-scheming-in-ai-models/">examples</a> of its models cheating and lying and, in an experiment showcased on the second floor of its San Francisco headquarters, appearing to converse in a totally indecipherable language. Researchers have so far induced these behaviors in controlled environments, with the hope of figuring out why they happen and preventing them. By putting all of those experiments on AI deception and sabotage into the wild, Moltbook provides a wake-up call as to just how unpredictable and hard to control AI agents already are. One could interpret it all as performance art.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/11/anthropic-hack-ai-cybersecurity/685061/">Read: Chatbots are becoming really, really good criminals</a></p><p>Moltbook also seems to offer real glimpses into how AI could upend the digital world we all inhabit: an internet in which generative-AI programs will interact with one another more and more, frequently cutting humans out entirely. This is a future of AI assistants contesting claims with AI customer-service representatives, AI day-trading tools interfacing with AI-orchestrated stock exchanges, AI coding tools debugging (or hacking) websites written by other AI coding tools. These agents will interact with and learn from one another in potentially bizarre ways. This comes with real risks: Already there have been reports that Moltbook exposes the owner of every AI agent that uses the platform to enormous cybersecurity vulnerabilities. AI agents, unable to think for themselves, may be induced into sharing private information after coming across subtly malicious instructions on the site. Tech companies have marketed this kind of future as desirable—playing on the idea that AI models could take care of every routine task for you. But Moltbook illustrates how hazy that vision really is.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps above all, the site tells us something about the present. The web is now an ouroboros of synthetic content responding to other synthetic content, bots posing as humans and, now, humans posing as bots. Viral memes are repeated and twisted ad nauseum; coded languages are developed and used by online communities as innocuous as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/taylor-swift-fandom-true-metaverse/671814/">music fandoms</a> and as deadly as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/09/minneapolis-church-shooting-influencers/684083/">mass-shooting forums</a>. The promise of the AI boom is to remake the internet and civilization anew; encasing that technology in a social network styled after the platforms that have warped reality for the past two decades feels not like giving a spark of life, but stoking the embers of a world we might be better off leaving behind.</p><div></div></section>

        <hr/>
        <section><p>T<span>he National Prayer Breakfast</span> was founded in 1953, when President Dwight Eisenhower accepted an invitation to join members of Congress to break bread together. Every president since has participated, regardless of party or religious persuasion. It offers an opportunity, <a href="https://npbfoundation.com/">according</a> to its organizers, for political leaders to gather and pray collectively for our nation “in the spirit of love and reconciliation as Jesus of Nazareth taught 2,000 years ago.”<br> <br> Donald Trump never got that memo—or, if he did, he’s found ways to ignore it.<br> <br> In a rambling, 75-minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSUsXH3Ft6I">speech</a> at the Prayer Breakfast yesterday, we saw the quintessential Trump. His comments were grievance-filled, narcissistic, conspiratorial, factually false, divisive, and insulting. He referred to his critics as “lunatics.” He engaged in projection, comparing them to “dictators” and “the gestapo.” He labeled Republican Representative Thomas Massie a “moron” because he won’t cast legislative votes the way Trump wants. Joe Biden is “Crooked Joe,” while Jacob Frey is “the horrible fake mayor” of Minneapolis. Trump <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3me4lrh33v522">praised</a> El Salvador’s authoritarian President Nayib Bukele—Bukele has <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/americas/573310-el-salvadors-president-labels-himself-worlds-coolest-dictator/">referred</a> to himself as “the world’s coolest dictator”—for his “very strong prisons.” (The prison that Trump celebrates, Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, known as CECOT, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/08/world/americas/el-salvador-prison-migrants.html">notorious</a> for its cruel and inhumane conditions.) Trump emphasized that Bukele—who also spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast—is “one of my favorite people.”</p><p>Trump took credit for churches “coming back stronger than ever” and for religion being “hotter than ever.” He claimed he has “done more for religion than any other president”—apparently, before the age of Trump, Christians couldn’t say “Merry Christmas” in public—and argued that his predecessors in the White House “bailed out” on religion. “I don’t know how a person of faith can vote for a Democrat. I really don’t,” he said, adding, “They cheat.”</p><p>The spirit of love and reconciliation that Jesus of Nazareth taught 2,000 years ago was not particularly evident in the words of the president. Of course, it never has been. No matter. The audience of some 3,500—the great majority of whom undoubtedly claim to be followers of Jesus—responded to Trump’s remarks with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CefkPh6-fW0">standing ovation</a>.</p><p>I<span>t is testimony </span>to the marketing genius of Donald Trump that he never sold himself to Christians as one of them—pious, devoted, merciful, forgiving, irenic, biblically literate, a faithful husband and father, a man of high moral standards. Instead, he sold himself as their protector. He didn’t hide his cruelty or his belief that the ends justify the means; doing so would have been impossible for him because they are central features of his personality. So he did the opposite: He presented himself to Christians as a fierce, even ruthless, warrior on their behalf. It worked. He built a huge, loyal, fanatical following.<br> <br> At the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump recounted comments made about him by <a href="https://firstdallas.org/who-we-are/#:~:text=Robert%20Jeffress%20is%20Senior%20Pastor,Baptist%20Church%2C%20Dallas%2C%20Texas">Robert Jeffress</a>, the senior pastor of the First Baptist Church in Dallas and a stalwart Trump ally for a decade.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/maga-christians-betray-ethics-ice/685679/">Peter Wehner: MAGA Jesus is not the real Jesus</a></p><p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/02/05/trump-heaven-national-prayer-breakfast-2024-election-win/88525808007/">According to Trump</a>, the case Jeffress made on his behalf in 2016 went like this: “He may not have ever read the Bible, but he will be a much stronger messenger for us.” It was Jeffress who <a href="https://www.tpr.org/2016-10-16/pastor-robert-jeffress-explains-his-support-for-trump">said at the time</a>, “I want the meanest, toughest SOB I can find to protect this nation.”<br> <br> Jerry Falwell Jr., then the president of Liberty University, put it <a href="https://x.com/JerryFalwellJr/status/1045853333007798272">this way</a> in a 2018 tweet: “Conservatives &amp; Christians need to stop electing ‘nice guys’. They might make great Christian leaders but the US needs street fighters like @realDonaldTrump at every level of government b/c the liberal fascists Dems are playing for keeps &amp; many Repub leaders are a bunch of wimps!”<br> <br> Tony Perkins, an ordained Southern Baptist minister and the president of the Family Research Council, a prominent evangelical activist group, <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/23/tony-perkins-evangelicals-donald-trump-stormy-daniels-216498/">admitted in 2018</a> that he and other evangelicals gave Trump a “mulligan” on his multiple affairs and hush-money payments to a porn star for a simple reason: Evangelicals “were tired of being kicked around by Barack Obama and his leftists. And I think they are finally glad that there’s somebody on the playground that is willing to punch the bully.” When asked what happened to turning the other cheek, Perkins replied, “You know, you only have two cheeks. Look, Christianity is not all about being a welcome mat which people can just stomp their feet on.”<br> <br> They thrill to watch Trump savage his critics, and their devotion grows with every dehumanizing word, with every merciless act.</p><p>If Henry VIII earned the title “<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/defender-of-the-faith">Defender of the Faith</a>,” why not Donald Trump?<br> <br> It is odd to see the very same evangelicals who claim the Bible is <a href="https://library.dts.edu/Pages/TL/Special/ICBI_1.pdf">inerrant</a> and who criticize fellow Christians about matters such as ordaining women—on the grounds that they are being unfaithful to what Paul wrote in one of his Epistles, an interpretation that many biblical scholars dispute—dismiss Jesus’s most famous sermon. For these Christians, the teachings of the son of God take a back seat to the pronouncements of the king of Mar-a-Lago.<br> <br> Much of today’s evangelical world sees Trump’s viciousness not as a vice but as a virtue, so long as it is employed against those they perceive as their enemies, against those whom they resent and for whom they have a seething hatred. Unless you’ve spent time in the evangelical world, fully appreciating the level of antipathy that exists toward Democrats and progressives is difficult. The only thing that exceeds it is the loathing reserved for the Christians and conservatives who broke with Trump because their commitment to their faith, and to cherished moral truths, required them to speak out against him.</p><p><span>What i am describing</span> isn’t true of all Christians, thankfully. Some have found the cumulative effect of Trump’s assault on Christian ethics too much. The Catholic Church and its American pope, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CBSNews/videos/pope-leo-says-trump-admin-extremely-disrespectful-to-immigrants/867411842633196/">Leo XIV</a>, are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/09/pope-leo-diplomacy-war-00719217">speaking out</a> prudentially but forcefully against the actions of the Trump administration. Mainline <a href="https://livingchurch.org/news/news-episcopal-church/church-leaders-show-revolutionary-love-after-minn-shooting/">denominations</a>, including the <a href="https://www.umnews.org/en/news/us-pastors-stand-against-federal-crackdown">United Methodists</a>, are stepping up. My friend <a href="https://www.ijm.org/people/mark-labberton">Mark Labberton</a>, a former president of Fuller Theological Seminary and a Presbyterian (PCUSA) pastor, traveled to Minneapolis to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/11/nx-s1-5671278/minnesota-clergy-are-mobilizing-against-the-fatal-shooting-of-renee-good">express</a> solidarity with the people of that city after an ICE agent killed Renee Good. He joined many others in peaceful protests in subzero temperatures. Other pastors and theologians I respect, several of whom were formative in my journey of faith, signed a <a href="https://faithfulresistance.com/">statement</a> titled “Christ Alone: A Call to Faithful Resistance.” It nowhere mentions the president or his party, but it does take a prophetic stance “in a time of fear and capitulation in both the Church and in our civic life.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/01/evangelical-christian-nationalism-trump/676150/">From the January/February 2024 Issue: My father, my faith, and Donald Trump</a></p><p>“In this moment we specifically call on the Church and peoples across the political spectrum to recognize the clear and present danger of rising authoritarian rule to all of us, especially the most vulnerable,” the statement says. “We commit ourselves to resisting cruel or oppressive means of control and to standing in solidarity with the oppressed, the marginalized, and the silenced.”</p><p>E<span>ven among evangelicals</span>, support for Trump is hardly universal, and many pastors I know are quite disturbed by the damage he and his administration are doing. Yet they know full well that many within their congregations voted for Trump and still align themselves with the Republican Party. These ministers are therefore hesitant to speak out not only from the pulpit but in any capacity. They want to keep their head down.<br> <br> That’s understandable. The best pastors I know are instinctively wary about speaking out politically; that’s not why they got into ministry in the first place. They don’t feel that it’s their job to offer political commentary, nor do many of them feel especially equipped to do so. They also realize that many people go to church seeking a safe haven from politics. They believe, too, and with some justification, that to take a stand, even with great care, might well split a congregation.</p><p>Evangelical denominations and pastors, though, even those who are not deeply immersed in politics, are generally willing to speak out on culture-war issues that have political and sometimes legislative implications. I’ve seen this happen many times over the years.</p><p>So the reluctance to take a prophetic stance in the realm of politics and culture is less a principled unwillingness than a selective one. Ministers, like most of the rest of us, are likely to wade into controversial waters only when it’s safe—in their case, when there is overwhelming agreement within a congregation on a set of issues. They speak out when the response from those in the pews is a resounding “Amen!” rather than even a handful of voices saying, “Oh no you don’t!”</p><p>I don’t pretend these are easy matters for pastors to face. A minister of a conservative congregation might tell himself that the downside to speaking out against the sins of the authoritarian right, even judiciously and without partisan rancor, is too costly. They may fear that their ministry will be damaged, that offended parishioners will tune them out, and that they will gain nothing concrete.</p><p>But aren’t prophets esteemed precisely for their willingness to tell difficult truths to the people of God? For being steadfast in the face of fierce criticism; for denouncing social injustice and idolatry, including political idolatry, when it’s unfashionable to do so; for issuing warnings when others fall silent; and for calling people to repentance during times of moral blindness?</p><p>N<span>on-maga evangelical pastors</span> are going to face a set of difficult questions during the next three years: <i>Under what conditions, if any, are you willing to speak out when a president and his administration repeatedly violate Christian ethics? Will you stay silent even when acts of cruelty, lawlessness, and injustice aren’t the exception but the norm? How much more indecency do you need to see before you act? </i></p><p>My colleague Jonathan Rauch, an eminently fair-minded, reasonable, and wise writer, recently <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/america-fascism-trump-maga-ice/685751/">explained</a> why, after heretofore avoiding the term, he has come around to the belief that Donald Trump’s governing style qualifies as fascist.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/america-fascism-trump-maga-ice/685751/">Jonathan Rauch: Yes, it’s fascism</a></p><p>Even if you disagree with Rauch’s conclusion, it’s still worth wrestling with his catalog of the president’s misdeeds, broken into 18 categories. And the case Rauch makes—that although America is not a fascist country, it has a fascist president—will almost certainly become stronger over time.</p><p>At some point, then, it may become nearly impossible for pastors who are not fully on board with MAGA to look away, to stall for more time, to let others do the heavy lifting, or to tell themselves that things aren’t so bad, that silence is golden. A healthy church culture, like a healthy family culture, brings things into the open. It doesn’t avoid or close off conversations.</p><p>Labberton, the Presbyterian pastor, once told me that the more highly contentious an issue is, the more likely he is to want to discuss it with his congregation in a way that is honest, open, and biblically informed. Of course, there will be a diversity of opinions. That’s not something to run from; it’s something to learn from.</p><p>“Our reality is sufficiently complex that we need to invite one another along for the journey,” Labberton said. We need to invite one another into respectful conversations. “Together we need to instigate a long journey into God’s mercy and justice.” Pastors, and the congregations they lead, have to hope that we can summon the courage to go where God’s mercy and justice lead us.</p><p>“Seldom, if ever, do I pause to answer criticism of my work and ideas,” Martin Luther King Jr. wrote. But when a group of white Alabama clergymen<a href="https://www.samford.edu/arts-and-sciences/files/History/Statement-and-Response-King-Birmingham.pdf"> declared</a> him an outside agitator whose efforts were “unwise and untimely,” he decided to respond. The result was “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/02/letter-from-a-birmingham-jail/552461/">Letter From Birmingham Jail</a>,” one of the most important documents in U.S. history.</p><p>This letter, like all of King’s greatest works, cannot be understood apart from his Christian faith. Faith shaped his views on ethics and human dignity. It also gave him the courage to create tension in the cause of justice. “I am grateful to God that, through the influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became an integral part of our struggle,” he wrote.</p><p>The white pastors in Birmingham had a case to make. They didn’t want what they called “days of new hope” in Birmingham to be undone by “extreme measures” that would cause divisions. King, one of America’s great prophets, saw things differently. He wept over the laxity of the Church and reminded it of its high calling—not to be the master or the servant of the state, but rather its conscience.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/02/letter-from-a-birmingham-jail/552461/">From the King issue: Martin Luther King Jr.’s ‘Letter From Birmingham Jail’</a></p><p>I imagine that all of the white pastors I know think that if they had been a minister at that time—especially if they were a minister of churches that were made up of white segregationists—they would have found a way to speak up rather than be silent, would have stood with King instead of those who urged caution in the name of unity.</p><p>The question now comes again in our time: What does it mean for the Church to be the conscience of the state?</p><div></div></section>

In the final episode of this season, we examine whether the administration is also trying to change the rules of our elections. Dawn Baldwin Gibson, a North Carolina pastor, tells us about how, in 2024, her vote was challenged for reasons that still aren’t clear to her. Host Anne Applebaum interviews Stacey Abrams, who has spent years fighting voter-suppression tactics. Abrams argues that Gibson’s story is one of many attempts to change how people vote and how their votes are counted.</p><p><em>The following is a transcript of the episode:</em></p><div><blockquote><p><strong>Dawn Baldwin Gibson: </strong>For more than 35 years, I have been a registered voter and I have been casting my vote. To this day, months later, I still don’t know why my vote was being challenged.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>[<em>Music</em>]</strong></p><p><strong>Anne Applebaum: </strong>From <em>The Atlantic</em>, this is <em>Autocracy in America</em>. I’m Anne Applebaum.  This season, we’ve been talking about the Trump administration’s unprecedented accumulation of power. But we’re still missing one piece of the story: the elections themselves. We’ve heard people talk about how they fear soldiers on the streets could intimidate voters, or how crypto barons could try to manipulate campaigns. But the [Donald] Trump White House is also very interested in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/12/2026-midterms-trump-threat/684615/">elections</a>: how voters are registered, how they vote, how those votes are counted.</p><p>Across the country, state governors and legislators, sometimes inspired by Trump’s false claims about the 2020 elections, are enacting new voter-ID rules; they’re changing registration requirements and crafting lists of voters to purge from the rolls.</p><p>Dawn Baldwin Gibson is a pastor in New Bern, North Carolina. She’s one of more than 60,000 North Carolina voters who had the legitimacy of their vote challenged in 2024.</p><div><blockquote><p><strong>Gibson: </strong>One of the races on the ballot was for the North Carolina Supreme Court. The election was between Allison Riggs and Jefferson Griffin. I actually went to vote as an early voter, and this is something that for many years I have done with my family. Showed my ID, went in, cast my vote, and really thought nothing else about it until a couple of weeks went by. I started hearing about this Jefferson Griffin list.</p> <p><strong>ABC11 newscaster: </strong>Republican candidate Griffin is challenging more than 65,000 ballots in the North Carolina Supreme Court race, arguing—</p> <p><strong>Gibson:</strong> The authority in North Carolina is the State Board of Elections. They were not challenging my vote. They were showing that I had done everything that I was supposed to have done for my vote to count. But Jefferson Griffin’s team, they were the ones challenging my vote. And that seemed like changing the rules after the results are not what you want.</p> <p>I just thought, <em>Do something! What can I do?</em> So we got a local church. We wrote letters. We talked to the local media.</p> <p><strong>CBS 17 newscaster 1: </strong>After months of back-and-forth legal rulings, the challenge to November’s supreme court election ruling is over.</p> <p><strong>CBS 17 newscaster 2:</strong> Republican Judge Griffin is conceding the race. His decision ends the only election— </p> <p><strong>Gibson:</strong> So yes, in the end we did get our votes to count, but it put a lot of stress. It put a lot of worry. I come from a rural community, and the word we would use is: It was a lot of <em>worry-ation</em>. They felt like—every time I go to vote, <em>Is this what I’m gonna have to put up with?</em> Go vote, and then there’s a challenge.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>[<em>Music</em>]</strong></p><div><blockquote><p><strong>Gibson:</strong> My maternal grandfather, Frederick Douglas Fisher—both of his parents were slaves. He believed in being a part of the American democracy process, and that process was voting, and that we, as his children and grandchildren, had a responsibility to show up and vote, and so there was a great pride in that. And to know that we are now in a time where we are seeing our votes being challenged, it is our responsibility. The breaking down of democracy is not going to happen on our watch. This is our time, where history will look back and say, <em>In 2025, there were people that stood and said: “I will be seen. I will be heard, and my vote will count.”</em></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>[<em>Music</em>]</strong></p><p><strong>Stacey Abrams: </strong>Voter suppression is one of the core tools of authoritarianism. It is how you shift from democracy to autocracy. And for millions of Americans, it’s about to become the norm.</p><p><strong>Applebaum: </strong>Stacey Abrams is one of the leading experts on the topic of voter registration and voter suppression. Her work has helped me understand that voter suppression isn’t a single thing or a law, but rather a thousand little cuts and changes, maybe designed to discourage just a few voters but which can make a big difference when elections are as close as ours. She’s the founder of Fair Fight, the voting-rights organization, and she twice ran for governor of Georgia. She’s also the lead organizer of a campaign to fight authoritarianism called the 10 Steps Campaign.  Stacey, what do you make of Dawn’s story?</p><p><strong>Abrams:</strong>  There are three components to voter suppression: Can you register and stay on the rolls? Can you cast a ballot? And does that ballot get counted? And what she is describing is that third barrier. What we have seen happen over the last decade and a half, since the erosion of the Voting Rights Act, is this wholesale attack on all three of those points of entry to democracy.</p><p>Can you register and stay on the rolls? Can you cast a ballot? She covered both of those hurdles, but she got tripped up by: Does your ballot count? And in Georgia, in Texas, across this country, in Florida, North Carolina, we are watching this dramatic acceleration of voter suppression and, sadly, it is going to be the most effective tool used by authoritarians to thwart the will of the people in the next few years.</p><p><strong>Applebaum:</strong> Okay. Let’s start with <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/11/gerrymandering-escalation-congress/685052/">gerrymandering</a>, the redrawing of voter-district boundaries. It’s a topic that is not remotely new in America. The word itself comes from Eldridge Gerry, who, while governor of Massachusetts in 1812, designed a voting district that supposedly looked like a salamander, hence <em>gerrymander</em>. So it’s very old practice, but this year, I think for the first time, we have an American president who has asked state governors to create new voter districts and even put quite heavy pressure on some of them in order to give his party an advantage in the midterm. This is now a national project, as opposed to something that happens locally, and it’s also out of season and out of order, because usually voter boundary changes are made after a census.</p><p>Now Governor [Greg] Abbott of Texas has already agreed to change boundaries in Texas, even without a census. Am I right that this is new? That the federal government’s involvement in this is different and maybe more dangerous?</p><p><strong>Abrams: </strong> There have been maps that have been redrawn in between census years, in between redistricting, but those had been exclusively court-ordered. When lines were drawn that did not conform, the court would take some time to look at these maps. Georgia, almost every single cycle after the Voting Rights Act, had to have its maps adjudicated by a court, and that was true for a lot of southern states.</p><p>And so it is not the case that there had never been redrawn districts. It had usually been that those districts were redrawn because the court said, <em>You didn’t do it right the first time</em>. But what we are seeing now, and what you’ve just described, is unprecedented. We have never had a president of the United States explicitly state that the line should be redrawn, not based on population, but based on voter outcome. And when you do that, when you decide that the districts are not designed to allow voters to elect their leaders, it is designed to allow leaders to elect their voters—that is a shift of power, and it is exactly what redistricting is designed to preclude.</p><p><strong>Applebaum: </strong>What do you make of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/10/california-redistricting-referendum-congress/684708/">the response</a> of Governor [Gavin] Newsom to the Texas redistricting? You know, he responded that if this was gonna be a federal-government project, that he was going to also make it a project in California. He held a referendum that has allowed California to also redistrict. I mean, is this just perpetuating the unfairness, or is this a legitimate response?</p><p><strong>Abrams: </strong>It is a legitimate response because we are in illegitimate times. What is unique in this moment is how aggressively one political party is leveraging this and the ends to which it is being used, which is to overthrow democracy and to install an authoritarian regime. So that is a distinction that is incredibly important if we’re gonna understand what Newsom did. When Trump said that he wanted to redraw those districts, when Abbott complied, when Missouri complied, when North Carolina complied, what they were doing was explicitly trying to strip power away from certain voters. And what Gavin Newsom understands is that performative pragmatism is not the response. This is an open battle for the kind of government we’re going to have. And what he did was not advance the cause of Democrats. He nullified the advance of authoritarianism.</p><p>We are going to either win or lose democracy in the next few years. It’s important for us not to think about this in the normative terms of political debate that we tend to have: one party versus the other. You and I both know that autocracies and authoritarian regimes have elections. Venezuela has elections. You know, Russia has elections. But they game before the election begins what the outcome is. The urgency of this moment is that if this holds, there will never again be the opportunity for competition, because if we have a single-party system that does not countenance democracy as the end goal, meaning that people actually get to participate, they will go through the motions, but it won’t really matter, because they’ll change the rules again. Because they will control the means of decision making, meaning they’ll control the presidency and they’ll control both chambers of Congress. And they have a pretty strong lock on the judiciary, which means that we won’t have the debate anymore, because changing the lines won’t matter, because the elections won’t matter.</p><p><strong>Applebaum:</strong>  Stacey, there’s another form of federal-government interference that the Republicans are also promoting, which is a federal law: the SAVE Act, or the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, which would require in-person voter registration and the presentation of physical documentary proof of U.S. citizenship in federal elections. So they’re asking people for not just a drivers’ license or ID, most of which, I should say, already requires U.S. citizenship to obtain, but for a passport or a birth certificate in addition. And this creates an extra hurdle that people might not think about, or they might not remember to do before the election. Is that the right way to characterize how this law is supposed to work?</p><p><strong>Abrams:</strong> The SAVE Act has disproportionate effect on very targeted communities: the 69 million women who may have changed their names after marriage, transgender people who may have had name changes. They’re going to say that you don’t have proof of your right to vote, because your name does not match your birth certificate and your Social Security card. That means that millions of people would be disenfranchised and would have to go through multiple hurdles to get back on the rolls. You knock out a group who also are more likely to vote Democratic than Republican.</p><p>I wanna be really clear. There are two conditions that are embedded in this argument that are important to understand. One is that you prove your citizenship, and the second is that you prove your identity. In the United States, both proofs are already required. This is not new. And, more importantly, there has been no discernible harm done to elections because people have not met these conditions. So it’s really, really important that we understand that this is a solution that has no problem. Republicans and Democrats both acknowledge—in fact, there was a report that came out after the 2020 election—we don’t have voter fraud in this country. It’s hard enough getting people to vote. People don’t really engage in trying to vote more than once, and people who do not have the right to vote, it is an extraordinary rarity that they will try.</p><p><strong>Applebaum: </strong> Right so there was no problem of noncitizens voting.</p><p><strong>Abrams: </strong>There’s no problem with noncitizens voting. There’s no problem with non-ID voting. You have always had to prove who you are to cast a ballot. The issue was not <em>Did you have to prove it?</em> It was <em>How did you prove it?</em></p><p><strong>Applebaum:</strong> Does this requirement affect other groups? What about Black voters?</p><p><strong>Abrams:</strong> Well, if you were born in the United States during Jim Crow and you were Black, you were legally not permitted to be born in a hospital, which meant that the birth certificate that you got was filed with the county, but it was not the original birth certificate from the hospital. So Black people, thousands and thousands of Black people, do not have an original birth certificate; 146 million Americans do not have a passport. Working-class and low-income Americans tend not to have that paperwork, and if they do, it’s not easily accessible. And so that is why in the U.S. we’ve created systems to allow you to prove your citizenship in other ways. And by changing those rules, you are lining up communities that will not be able to participate in elections.</p><p><strong>Applebaum: </strong> Would the lack of participation not also hurt Republicans? Again, there are a lot of Republicans who presumably don’t have passports and don’t have birth certificates.</p><p><strong>Abrams:</strong> It does. And that’s one of the reasons I think this should be a bipartisan fight. Because when you try to break democracy by targeting one community, the problem is: You break it for everyone. And so they are willing to risk it because they think it will help them more than it will hurt them.</p><p>And the reason it matters is that when you tell the average person, <em>You’re not allowed to vote</em>, they’re gonna get mad. But it’s unlikely that they’re going to go to court to force the issue. And in a year, and in a nation, where margins of thousands of voters, not millions of voters, decide the outcome, if the federal government controls that data, if they can manipulate that information, they can then start to attack thousands and thousands of voters and win on the margins—not by actually winning the election, but by forcing voter suppression to lead people to simply not bother trying. And that has the same effect as not voting.</p><p><strong>Applebaum: </strong>I also want to talk about your own experience with this. So, after you ran for governor of Georgia in 2018, you raised a lot of questions about whether voter-suppression tactics by your opponent had influenced the race. You sued. And, of course, you acknowledged the outcome of the race in the end, that he would be governor, and you wouldn’t. But there was a nuance to your position that opened you up for criticism. I wonder if you could explain the nuance.</p><p><strong>Abrams:</strong>  The tradition in politics is that once an election is over, you use the word <em>concede</em>. And as someone who is not only a lawyer but also a writer, words matter to me. They have meaning; they have heft. But I’m also the daughter of two civil-rights activists. My father was arrested when he was 14, registering Black people to vote in Mississippi. And so I take very seriously, and it has been my life’s work, since I was 17, to focus on the access to democracy that is contained within the right to vote.</p><p>And so when I gave my speech on the night that we realized, despite the very clear and unambiguous voter-suppression tactics leveraged by my opponent, I said, <em>He won</em>. I was very clear about that. I said he was going to be governor. I was not, but I refused to use the word <em>concede</em>, because concession in that statement meant to say that the system that he leveraged was true or correct or proper, and I could not in good conscience say that. I never once questioned whether or not he became the governor. I questioned the system that allowed him and his cohorts to block access to the right to vote for thousands and thousands of Georgians. And because I refused to use the word <em>concede</em>, it became weaponized. But I never once filed a suit to make myself governor. I never once filed a personal suit. Trying to dislodge him. Every lawsuit that was filed was about the system itself. It was never going to solve the problem of me not winning. It was always in service of: How do we ensure that voters have their rights protected?</p><p><strong>Applebaum: </strong> Right. Right. So that’s very different from the 2020 campaign, when Donald Trump tried to overthrow the results of an election.</p><p><strong>Abrams:</strong> Absolutely. And it’s a distinction that anyone with good faith or with good hearing can discern. Running for office does not guarantee you victory, but being a citizen in this country should guarantee you access to the right to vote.</p><p><strong>[<em>Music</em>]</strong></p><p><strong>Applebaum: </strong>After the break:</p><div><blockquote><p><strong>Abrams: </strong>I fundamentally believe, based on what I’ve watched this country do, what we have watched other nations do, that we can indeed fight back. But you cannot fight if you do not understand the opposition.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Applebaum: </strong>We’ll be right back.</p><p>[<strong><em>Break</em></strong>]</p><p><strong>Applebaum: </strong>Stacey, it’s illogical to think that illegal immigrants are eagerly voting in American elections, and there is no evidence that they do. Why would they want to attract that kind of attention from the government? Nevertheless, the administration, the Republican Party, MAGA media have been talking for years and years and years, actually, about illegal immigrants voting, even, as you say, proposing legislation to prevent it. Is this because they genuinely fear illegal voters? Or does it have a different purpose? Maybe the point is to create hysteria about an unfair election in advance, just in case the Republicans lose. That would give them an excuse to refuse to swear in new members of Congress. Or maybe they want to intimidate <em>legal</em> voters.</p><p><strong>Abrams: </strong> Lies work. (<em>Laughs</em>.) Lies are a very effective deterrent for voter participation. But there’s also the micro issue. When people think that they might be arrested if they show up, then they won’t vote. If people believe that there is some harm they will face, they won’t show up. When people think that it is going to be too hard, when they think that it is going to be dangerous, they don’t vote.</p><p>So let’s look at New Jersey in 1981. New Jersey had a tendency to have armed folks standing in the polling places where Black people were voting. And based on that behavior, they were actually denied, the Republicans were denied, the right to do election observation for 30 years. The reason it became so important was that people would say, <em>I’m not going to vote, because I could be arrested</em>. Not that they had done something wrong, but they were afraid of being arrested because you had law enforcement patrolling voting places.</p><p><strong>Applebaum: </strong>I mean, look. The establishment of ICE as a kind of paramilitary, a federal police that’s not just used to enforce the law but to intimidate people, as well as the decision to send the National Guard into American cities has already got one governor, Governor [J. B.] Pritzker of Illinois, to say that these decisions are not just about fighting crime or public safety, but about creating a pretext to send armed military troops into communities now or during the 2026 election. So it sounds like you think that’s a possibility.</p><p><strong>Abrams: </strong> I think it’s a likelihood, because we’ve seen it happen. In Georgia, Hancock County, deputy sheriffs followed Black men home. And that behavior was so egregious that Black men started calling the county, saying, <em>Please take my name off of the voting rolls, because I don’t want the sheriff coming back to my house</em>. That was a decade ago.</p><p>We know that when people are afraid, they will do what they can to protect themselves and their families. And just in case the fear isn’t real enough, this administration, suborned by Republicans at every level of government, are willing to threaten the possibility of harm in order to game winning an election. And the reason they are doing this so aggressively is because they believe that if they can do it, they will control every level of government and every lever of power. Authoritarianism isn’t about winning a single election. It is about dismantling a democratic system and installing a system that lacks accountability and has unchecked power. That’s what they’re after, and we cannot be so naive as to think that this is just about who wins a race. This is about who wins America.</p><p><strong>Applebaum:</strong>  I thought that it was illegal for armed troops, certainly military, to be anywhere near polling booths on Election Day. Is that not the case?</p><p><strong>Abrams: </strong>I will say it this way: It’s illegal if you note them. But let’s be clear, there are only a few places ICE is not permitted to go. And because they are masked, because they’re unidentified, it is not just the actual harm—it’s the specter of harm. That’s what we have to be thinking about. It’s not just the explicit violation of the law; it’s the implicit threat that the law permits them to exercise. And when the U.S. Supreme Court said that you could detain people based on their race, their accent, or the language they spoke, when you said that ICE could do that, there is nothing to preclude ICE from doing that while you’re standing in line getting ready to cast a ballot. So you may not have the National Guard there, but ICE is not actually military.</p><p><strong>Applebaum:</strong>  I want to move way upstream in this discussion of elections, from the actual voting to the culture of election information and voter engagement. Here’s an example: TikTok may be about to change from Chinese ownership to U.S. ownership, and the new owners could be U.S. billionaires who are friendly to Trump. We know that TikTok is one of the main sources of political information for young people. Do you think that this change in ownership could be deliberately designed to alter perceptions of the coming campaign, to change how people feel about the candidates? Is that something that counts as election interference? And if so, how do we think about it?</p><p><strong>Abrams: </strong>Not only is it possible—it is highly likely. Half of young people get their news right now from TikTok and YouTube. Voting is as much a cultural event as it is a practical one. I vote in part because my parents used to take us with them to vote. I watched my parents vote in every election. It was part of our culture. We knew that voting was an important thing to do. There’s a young woman, Esosa Osa, who started a company, an organization called Onyx Impact, and she has done extraordinary research into how disinformation intentionally targeted Black people. It works as a voter-suppression tool.</p><p><strong>Applebaum:</strong> To convince them not to vote?</p><p><strong>Abrams:</strong> To convince them not to vote or that their votes don’t matter or that the vote that they have taken is somehow being manipulated. And it works. If you have conversations with those in the Latino population, they will tell you about the very subtle language that got inserted into conversations that they were listening to on the radio, that reminded them that their participation would be akin to supporting a regime that their families escaped from a decade before. And so, yes, culture is absolutely upstream, but when it floods the zone, it changes outcomes.</p><p><strong>Applebaum: </strong>Stacey, this is the last episode in a season that’s been exploring the administration’s power grab from several angles. We have noted: This is not just arming ICE and sending the National Guard to cities. It’s not just the construction of a biased civil service. It’s not just the reshaping of culture and science. It’s not just the direction of cryptocurrency profits to congressional campaigns. It’s all of these things put together. How should listeners think about the defense of democracy? Is it a state-by-state effort? Is it issue by issue? Should we have a unified national approach?</p><p><strong>Abrams: </strong>So the Constitution gives oversight of elections to state government. We don’t have a single democracy. We have 50-plus different democracies operating at any given moment. And so, yes, part of the solution is going to be a state and local solution because the ripple effects of this will reach every level of government. We may be having conversations about Congress, but we’ve gotta understand that this will affect city councils and school boards and county commissioners and state legislatures. It will affect everything that government is responsible for delivering or not delivering. And so we have to have a localized response. That means more people have to volunteer to be poll watchers. More people have to organize to ensure that their communities understand what the votes actually count towards.</p><p>The young woman at the top of this conversation from North Carolina, she got it—that it wasn’t just about whether or not a supreme-court justice in North Carolina got seated. It was whether or not kids in that school were going to get lunch, because the elections that are happening decide: How do we respond to SNAP benefits being cut? How do we respond to the ACA subsidies being diminished? How do we respond to disabled veterans being fired from their jobs because of the anti-DEI executive orders? Those are all of a piece, and so we have to have a multilayered, multipronged response to what is a multilayered, multipronged attack.</p><p>But I fundamentally believe, based on what I’ve watched this country do, what we have watched other nations do, that we can indeed fight back. But you cannot fight if you do not understand the opposition. We could win. But we are very, very, very likely to lose if we keep treating this as business as usual. This is not about whether this Democrat wins or that Republican wins. This is about whether democracy wins or authoritarianism wins.</p><p><strong>[<em>Music</em>]</strong></p><p><strong>Applebaum:</strong>  Thank you so much, Stacey Abrams.</p><p><strong>Abrams:</strong>  Thank you for having me.</p><p><strong>Applebaum:</strong> And thank you all for listening. I hope that you’ve also concluded that this is not business as usual. The Trump administration is making deep changes to our political system and to the nature of our government. They are doing so with an eye towards <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/11/tilting-playing-field/685035/">tilting</a> the playing field, shaping the elections in November, and, of course, the next presidential election, in 2028. If we want to keep our elections free and fair, not just this time but into the future, all of us will have to pay attention, take part, join campaigns, learn about local candidates, communicate with others, and vote. We don’t want this to be the last chance.</p><p><em>Autocracy in America</em> is produced by Arlene Arevalo, Natalie Brennan, and Jocelyn Frank. Editing by Dave Shaw.

        <hr/>
        <section><p>A<span>t some point</span> over the past 15 years, kids stopped reading. Or at least their teachers stopped asking them to read the way they once did. We live in the age of the reel, the story, the sample, the clip. The age of the excerpt. And even in old-fashioned literature classes, assignments have been abbreviated so dramatically that high-school English teachers are, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/12/us/high-school-english-teachers-assigning-books.html">one recent survey</a>, assigning fewer than three books a year.</p><p>I’ve seen the effects of this change up close, having taught English in college classrooms since 2007, and I’ve witnessed the slow erosion of attention firsthand, too: students on computers in the back of lecture halls, then on phones throughout the classroom, then outsourcing their education to artificial intelligence. We know that tech companies supply the means of distraction. But somehow the blame falls on the young reader. Whole novels aren’t possible to teach, we are told, because students won’t (or can’t) read them. So why assign them?</p><p>When I walked into my American-literature class at Case Western Reserve University last fall, I looked at 32 college students, mostly science majors, and expected an uphill battle. As my colleague Rose Horowitch has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/the-elite-college-students-who-cant-read-books/679945/">reported</a>, “Many students no longer arrive at college—even at highly selective, elite colleges—prepared to read books.” One-third of the high-school seniors tested in 2024 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/us/12th-grade-reading-skills-low-naep.html">were found</a> not to have basic reading skills.</p><p>Yet by the end of the semester, as we read the last sentence of Toni Morrison’s <i>Song of Solomon</i>, I regretted ever doubting my students. I am now convinced that I was wrong to listen to the ostensible wisdom of the day—and that teachers of literature are wrong to give up assigning the books we loved ourselves. There may be plenty of good reasons to despair over the present. The literature classroom should not be one of them.</p><p>T<span>he image of a college literature class</span> hasn’t changed much in the past 50 years. A group of students are sitting around a table, or maybe they’re perched in a lecture hall, looking down at a passage by Melville, reading a sentence out loud, puzzling over a metaphor, feeling the jolt of possibility that comes when their world is reimagined in startling language. My most vivid memory of reading an entire novel in college was picking up Virginia Woolf’s <i>To the Lighthouse</i>. On an unseasonably warm spring night in 2002, I propped myself against the steps of the library, opened the book, and stayed there until the early morning.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/10/education-decline-low-expectations/684526/">Idrees Kahloon: America is sliding toward illiteracy</a></p><p>I’ve taught for nearly two decades, but last fall I was worried in a way I’d never been before. I’ve always assigned long, challenging books. I regularly teach <i>To the Lighthouse </i>to first-year students, sometimes swapping it out for James Joyce’s <i>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man </i>or Mulk Raj Anand’s <i>Untouchable.</i> But anecdotes and statistics about the decline of reading unsettled me. Plus, I was worried about my own raddled attention span, and I was unnerved by the apparent inevitability of AI-generated essays.</p><p>My course, a survey of American literature from 1660 to the present, felt like a dare: 400 years of literature in a single semester. And yet my fears that students might refuse to read helped clarify my approach. Instead of hopscotching from one excerpt to the next, I’d create small eddies in time. We’d spend several days, sometimes a couple of weeks, on a single author. We’d read nonfiction and novels—Harriet Jacobs’s <i>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</i>, Faulkner’s <i>As I Lay Dying</i>, Willa Cather’s <i>My Ántonia</i>—and long poems. I couldn’t be comprehensive; the course’s remit was, essentially, Puritans to the present. I was, instead, serious about reading whole books (and sermons: It’s impossible not to include Jonathan Edwards’s “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” if you’re seeking to understand early American literature). I would teach the students what I was starting to miss myself: tarrying with an author beyond his best-known works, developing a relationship with a novelist across wildly different novels.</p><p>Two things became clear in the early weeks of class. First, the students were reading. They were reading everything, or most of it. I know this because I had them identify obscure passages, without notes, devices, or books at hand. Second, they were experiencing life in a way that was not easy outside the class and its assignments. They were expected—required—to give huge chunks of time to an activity, reading, that was not monetizing their attention in real time. They had, in effect, taken back their lives, for an hour or two each day. It turned out that American literature, which so often flirts with utopian fantasies of regaining control—hello, <i>Walden</i>!—could do precisely that.</p><p>T<span>o give the students time</span> to read, I had to change the way they wrote. I axed the take-home essays I’d assigned before—this wasn’t a “writing” class, anyway—and assigned what I suspected were far more difficult in-class, timed “flash essays,” with prompts I gave the same day. No trudging back from the library with 10 pages on Woolf in the special season of Cleveland weather we call “stupid cold.” Long, research-based essay assignments had always worked well for the top students in the class, the ones who were already trained to write. But I’ve rarely seen, over the course of my career, the kind of development I hoped for in the majority of students whom I asked to write that way.</p><p>I was also thinking of the writing I myself had been doing lately, smooshed within the hour I had for lunch, or pounded out on the couch after toddler bedtime. I wanted my students to have a taste of the adrenaline and, yes, stress that came from writing when faced with real time constraints. I wanted edge-of-the-seat writing that opened itself up to failure. They would confront their fear without guardrails, without bumpers, without AI-drafted support, without a plan or even a thesis. One student came up to me after the first flash essay, a little frustrated and worried that he wasn’t meeting the mark. He felt like he was writing into the complete unknown, rather than with a plan in mind. I said that was exactly the point.</p><p>In a haunting sentence from <i>Austerlitz</i>, by the German novelist W. G. Sebald, the titular character describes losing control of his language. Once a fluent and successful writer, Austerlitz suddenly falls into a crisis of faith about the sentence, which becomes “at best a makeshift expedient, a kind of unhealthy growth issuing from our ignorance, something which we use, in the same way as many sea plants and animals use their tentacles, to grope blindly through the darkness enveloping us.” I liked the metaphor of writing into the darkness. So I devised simple essay topics that asked students to write about their own difficulties as readers. One was: “Write about a moment in an Emily Dickinson poem that you don’t understand.” Another was: “Write about your morning routine, but in the style of Faulkner.” I didn’t want to create 32 new Faulkners. I wanted the students to experience the moment when their own style broke through the imitation, when the attempt to write like Faulkner failed and revealed, as a kind of photonegative, their own emergent voices. John Keats called this state of being “negative capability,” a condition in which the writer learns to live in a perpetual state of uncertainty. If it was really true that the students couldn’t read, then it was up to me to put the books in their way and make them deal with them.</p><p>A<span>dults underestimate</span> the power of simply telling a young person to read a book and vouching for it ourselves. A teacher gave me Leo Tolstoy and Victor Hugo when I was far too young. I loved to read already, but at that age (13), my diet had been <i>Star Trek</i> novelizations, Michael Crichton, and—thanks to a dull sick day browsing my parents’ shelves—<i>The Bonfire of the Vanities</i>. In early high school, I read <i>War and Peace</i> and <i>Les Misèrables</i> and was absolutely mystified by the density of detail. I was frequently bored—all those pages on the sewer system of Paris—and then suddenly moved to tears by a character like Eponine, who “smiled a little, and died” in the arms of Marius. I was just too immature for other novels: Emma Bovary’s desire and Charles Swann’s jealousy mystified me, because I would not ask anyone out for at least another five years. Inundating myself with thousand-page novels set in the early 19th century, I had nearly every experience one has while reading, and I had them all at once. I came as close to overdosing on Russian mood swings as I could. But by the time I reached the end of high school, I developed a tolerance for what I did not understand, and then I gradually understood it. Once I did begin to understand, I felt an extraordinary desire to repeat the experience. Reading this much made books feel like a “doorway” for me, as George Saunders has called it.</p><p>I saw something like this happen in my American-literature class. First impressions, in literature as in life, are unreliable. When we started <i>Walden</i>, plenty of students were turned off by Thoreau’s long-winded musings on the real-estate market in New England. Two classes later, Thoreau was a friend for life. His timeless needling felt timely: “We know not where we are. Beside, we are sound asleep half our life.” Despite his flight to the woods, Thoreau was more easily distracted than any of us—by birdsong, by a train whistle, by the sound of ice cracking. He could barely sustain a single thought without jumping to an unrelated idea. <i>Walden </i>is a book that freely indulges in distraction—not to dull our senses, but to keep ourselves awake, curious, delighted, enraged. Thoreau’s world sends us constant notifications, and by doing so, asks us to reject the “vain reality” where we have been “shipwrecked.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/the-elite-college-students-who-cant-read-books/679945/">From the November 2024 issue: The elite college students who can’t read books</a></p><p>The iterative process of confusion, endurance, and incremental understanding is what literature professors teach when they assign whole books. This march toward understanding doesn’t have a great name other than <i>reading</i>. We need to help students grow into the difficulty of reading. The best way to do that is not to “meet them where they are,” a bromide that has become doctrine for higher education. We have to do as Whitman says instead: Stop somewhere ahead and wait for them to catch up.</p><p>N<span>one of this is to say</span> that higher education faces no challenges in this moment. Universities’ resources are severely constrained; their research missions have been <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/02/nih-trump-university-crisis/681634/">hobbled</a>. In many institutions, academic freedom has been threatened or abrogated. These are bleak conditions, possibly terminal ones for the post–World War II dream of a research university. I agree with those who argue that universities find themselves in a state of crisis. But narratives about the “end of reading” strike me as self-inflicted, the manifestation of a collective depression. (In other words, to borrow from Thoreau, “We know not where we are.”) If we want students to keep reading books, faculty have the most important role to play—regardless of whatever new devices or platforms emerge to capture students’ attention. The reaction to declining reading skills, poor comprehension, and fragmented attention spans should not be to negotiate or compromise, but to double down on the cure.</p><p>Defenses of the humanities largely get things right. Books teach you empathy because you imagine other lives. Poems refresh our conventional words—what Wallace Stevens derided as the “rotted names”—by investing language with power and nuance. I’m partial to the way the poet Adrienne Rich put it while teaching in the tuition-free City College of New York system: “What interests me in teaching is less the emergence of the occasional genius than the overall finding of language by those who did not have it and by those who have been used and abused to the extent that they lacked it.” Literature helps you express your own thoughts in vivid language, partly by imitating the writers who do it well. If you’re not inclined toward the ethical view, or Rich’s vision of social transformation, books might provide escape routes instead, invitations to leisure or to what my colleague Adam Kirsch <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/reading-crisis-solution-literature-personal-passion/685461/">has called</a> “vice.”</p><p>But the whole notion of having to defend literature or the humanities in the first place may have us wrong-footed. It’s not only what you learn from reading <i>Moby-Dick</i>—notwithstanding Melville’s extensive knowledge of 19th-century whaling—but what you are doing when you are reading <i>Moby-Dick</i>. You are neither learning a transferable skill nor escaping from the world’s demands that you do. You are not word-maxxing or optimizing information for efficiency. You are engaged in a singular practice, one with its own primary justification.</p><p>The students I taught last semester turned enthusiastically to Faulkner and spent their time reading about the journey of the Bundren family to bury their mother’s body. Why did they do this? Because I asked them to, and told them it was worth it. I said that time was precious, and that we needed to take some of it back for ourselves. So we did.</p><div></div></section>

        <section><p>B<span>arry Benson tightened his grip</span> on his steering wheel. The federal wildlife-damage-abatement officer had handled bears, coyotes, and wolves. But now he was on a bigger hunt. And he was not alone. At an utterly unassuming, otherwise-bucolic intersection just outside the 280-acre Schmeeckle Reserve in rural <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2020/05/wisconsin-photos/611710/">Wisconsin</a>, dozens of cars—Benson’s among them—idled in the predawn darkness of 5 a.m., all tuned into the same local radio station, 90 FM, waiting for instructions.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2020/05/wisconsin-photos/611710/">Read: Wisconsin: Images of the badger state</a></p><p>Suddenly a voice crackled into the night air: “From where you are now, go past the walking people. Now turn left. Careful, the lane ends. Go past the large cat, the show hosted by David Letterman, the French explorer, the white star, and the printed word <em>seven</em>. Turn left after the protected plastic yellow sleeves. Go past the red arrow. Now turn right. Continue down the road … You have 45 minutes.”</p><p>Cars screeched and sped off. The chase was on.</p><p>The cryptic announcement was one of hundreds of clues in <a href="https://www.90fmtrivia.org">Trivia Weekend</a>, billed as “the world’s largest trivia contest,” which annually floods the college town of Stevens Point, Wisconsin, with about 10,000 players (the town’s population is just 26,000). For 54 nonstop hours, the college radio station asks more than 400 questions, waiting only the length of a song or two for the answer. The more teams that answer a question correctly, the less it’s worth. There are also scavenger hunts and music scrambles, where eight songs are spliced into 11 seconds and must each be identified.</p><p></p><p>The morning at Schmeeckle Reserve was in April 2019, in what has been nostalgically called the “before times.” Before <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/ed-yong/">COVID-19</a>, of course. But also before mask and vaccine mandates. Before working from home. Before using <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/07/how-to-fight-zoom-fatigue/670513/">Zoom for everything</a> from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2021/04/what-pandemic-has-done-class-2020/618614/">school</a> to funerals.

Before Redditors made bank from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/02/gamestop-story-you-think-you-know-wrong/617905/">GameStop stock</a>.</p><p>Trivia Weekend celebrated its 50th anniversary that year (the mayor’s <a href="https://www.wsaw.com/content/news/Mayor-of-Stevens-Point-participates-in-worlds-largest-trivia-contest-508549541.html">44th year</a> playing). There was a kickoff parade, which sometimes includes weddings. That year, the parade ended with Governor Tony Evers issuing a <a href="https://evers.wi.gov/Pages/Newsroom/Proclamations/041219%20Trivia%20Weekend.pdf">proclamation</a> enshrining that weekend as Trivia Weekend statewide.</p><p>Over the years, nothing had stopped it. Not a <a href="https://stevenspoint.news/2018/04/20/spring-snowstorm-breaks-record-buries-area/">20-inch blizzard</a> in 2018. Or even the miracle of childbirth (Anne Frederiksen played throughout the Friday night of trivia in 1991 and gave birth that Saturday to a girl who was almost named Trivianna—she went with Lauren instead; her team came in first that year). One year in the 1990s, a local woman fell into a coma in November and awoke in December to doctors warning her she would be hospital-bound for life. “But I have to play trivia in April,” she told them—and she did, sending the quizmaster a thank-you T-shirt afterward embroidered with a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/hillary-clinton-cross-stitch/416376/">needlepoint</a> poem. Even the town’s police, firefighters, and EMTs played on a team called the Choir Boys. The <em>Jeopardy</em> superstar Ken Jennings’s best-selling book on trivia, <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/brainiac-adventures-in-the-curious-competitive-compulsive-world-of-trivia-buffs-ken-jennings/9780812974997?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs</em></a>, has a chapter about Stevens Point. Trivia Weekend was a way of life. One year, local merchants reported that the only holiday that stimulated the town’s economy more was Thanksgiving. Trivia Weekend was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/pandemic-christmas/616925/">bigger than Christmas</a>.</p><p>Then came COVID.</p><p>“There is a cloud overhead,” wrote Trivia Weekend’s quizmaster, known as Oz, in an email on March 12, 2020. “Many of you have heard about the announcement by the University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point concerning extension of spring break and suspension of in-person classes until April 15th. This is presuming that things don’t get worse, which there is no promise of that … So, I like to avoid the problem. At this time ‘Raid on Trivia 51’ is being postponed until the weekend of October 23, 24, 25, 2020.”</p><p>Like many proms and weddings and funerals and office meetings that could’ve been emails, Trivia Weekend in October 2020 was largely confined to Zoom. The marathon took breaks from midnight to 8 a.m., and a lack of human-run phone banks meant that answers were submitted through web forms that hadn’t shaken out all of their flaws. It didn’t return to being in person until last year.</p><p>T<span>rivia Weekend</span> was a kind of annual <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/09/shame-on-breaking-amish/262530/"><em>rumspringa</em></a>, a time when mild-mannered midwesterners could stop living Wisconsinbly and become <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/02/how-much-sleep-is-normal/385075/">sleep-deprived</a> zombies animated in equal parts by book smarts, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/07/a-history-of-day-drinking/397397/">beer smarts</a>, and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/07/google-making-us-stupid-and-smart-same-time/352885/">Google</a>. At the core of the festivities is Network, a team of Pointers (as people from Stevens Point are called) who have been playing every year since 1976, when many of them were in ninth grade—they’ve taken the first-place prize 22 times and placed in the top 10 in all but their first two years (including the pandemic years). They are known as the Dark Lords of Trivia. Their mascot is <a href="https://firesigntheatre.bandcamp.com/album/george-leroy-tirebiter-the-complete-collection">George Leroy Tirebiter</a>, a long-lost pet tarantula from a member’s childhood. Once, in the 1980s, amid a four-hour perfect run, they debated purposely answering a question wrong to quell suspicion that they were cheating.</p><p>Even if you’ve never heard of Network, you may have played against them. One member, Ray Hamel, a <a href="https://slate.com/author/ray-hamel">quizmaster at <em>Slate</em></a>, has published more than 2,000 crossword puzzles, including one for every day of the week for <em>The New York Times</em>. Since 1980, he has been taking notes on the movies he watches, and has logged about 11,000 flicks; in 2018, he beat his annual record with 454, but by Trivia Weekend 2019 he was already on track for 650 (he hit 635, which still stands as his record). Another Network member, Jim Newman, has written questions for NPR’s <em>Ask Me Another</em>, runs pub trivia in bars across <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/los-angeles-city-state/619042/">Los Angeles</a>, has directed a stage adaptation of the old television quiz show <em>What’s My Line?</em>, and created a podcast—<a href="https://gofactyourpod.com/about/"><em>Go Fact Yourself</em></a>—that tests celebrities on their nerdy realms of interest. He went on <em>Jeopardy</em> in 1993 and was beaten by the eventual Tournament of Champions winner the following year.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/07/jeopardy-fan-contestant-losing/670950/">Adriana E. Ramírez: Everyone loses on <em>Jeopardy</em> eventually</a></p><p>Network’s core is Barry Heck, whose mother’s basement hosted the team continuously from  1980 through 2019. When the Heck family moved neighborhoods in 1988, they engineered their new basement specifically for trivia, building bookshelves customized to the exact size of, say, a huge collection of Big Little Books or every <em>World Almanac</em> since 1868 (unlike many trivia contests, outside references are allowed). The prize of the collection, housed in a glass cabinet, is a set of the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> bought by Heck’s grandfather in 1918. The overall collection is so large—extending even to vintage <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/07/board-games-have-colonialism-problem/619518/">board games</a> (Leave It to Beaver Ambush Game! Nancy Drew! Stick the IRS!) and limited-run <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/how-marketers-invented-the-modern-version-of-breakfast/487130/">cereal boxes</a> (Addams Family cereal! Nickelodeon Green Slime cereal! Sugar Jets!)—that the basement has its own card catalog and a 1,200-page printout from 1999 dubbed the Megadex. Network plays with a dedicated <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/slack-office-trouble/620173/">Slack channel</a> running on <a href="https://www.theonion.com/coworker-with-two-computer-screens-not-fucking-around-1819573756">two large monitors</a>. Amid the clutter are the team’s dozens of trophies.</p><p>In 2019, Heck’s trove came particularly in handy. In a complicated question about the <em>Explorer Scout Manual</em>, Heck, himself a Life Scout, sauntered over to his vintage manual, flipped to page 155—“backwoods engineering”—and found the answer. It was worth 400 points, which means only one other team knew it. But he also had secret weapons in his nieces, 15-year-old Emma and 10-year-old Renee, who were well versed in Disney shows and cartoons (about which there are a disproportionate number of questions for <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/amphtml/travel/nation/disney-adult-confessions">an adult contest</a>).</p><p>When I asked why he has stuck with Trivia Weekend over the decades, Heck shrugged: “It’s something we do for ourselves, not for the neighbors or the internet or anyone else.” His mother, Mary Ann, now 90, made doughnuts for the team every Sunday morning during the tournament for almost half a century. She loves the group, whom she still calls “kids,” and the feeling is very mutual. When her husband and Barry’s father, Ron, died in 2013, most of the team came back to Stevens Point for the funeral, where the pastor began the eulogy with three <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/08/ariel-sabar-what-happened-to-the-gospel-of-jesus-wife/615160/">biblical-trivia questions</a>, which the team solemnly answered.</p><p>F<span>rom a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/01/loneliness-solitude-pandemic-habit/672631/">lonely</a> apartment </span>in Brooklyn (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/08/choosing-pet-happiness/619663/">with a cat</a>), then a lonelier one in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/how-san-francisco-became-failed-city/661199/">San Francisco</a>—no roommate, no paramour, no pet—I writhed through much of 2020, including an 18-day fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit with coughs that led to diminished lung capacity that I developed after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/bronx-new-york-yankee-stadium-coronavirus/2020/04/21/3b38b460-8182-11ea-a3ee-13e1ae0a3571_story.html">reporting</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/new-york-little-italy-coronavirus/2020/04/13/fc21ae82-7aae-11ea-a130-df573469f094_story.html">on</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/coronavirus-hiv-aids-new-york/2020/04/02/9e7f8728-74f4-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d_story.html">the</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/frustrated-and-struggling-new-yorkers-contemplate-abandoning-the-city-they-love/2020/05/25/153ca71e-9c5b-11ea-a2b3-5c3f2d1586df_story.html">unfolding</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/coronavirus-new-york-police-fines/2020/04/08/8e970df6-790c-11ea-9bee-c5bf9d2e3288_story.html">pandemic</a> for <em>The Washington Post</em>.</p><p>My saving grace was a weekly Sunday-night Zoom session with a motley cohort of L.A. industry <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/08/why-we-should-talk-strangers-more/619642/">strangers</a>—producers, musicians, actors, designers, and writers of all types (one of whom had sent me an invitation). For two hours every week, we could retreat into a carnival of knowledge and know-how (some challenges involved drawing or doing impressions or silently mouthing a catchphrase). I was not alone. We were not alone. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/04/britain-pubs-trivia-quiz-fun-coronavirus/609889/">Pub-style</a> trivia took off in a big way that year, despite being handicapped by the pandemic. “It’s not a question of being smart. It’s just a neurological quirk where we remember things,” a trivia columnist told <em>The New York Times</em> in a November 2020 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/28/at-home/virtual-bar-trivia.html">trend story</a>. Another trivia leader chimed in: “It’s testing knowledge, but it’s not testing anything important.” The beloved <em>Jeopardy</em> host <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/11/alex-trebek-made-jeopardy-nerds-look-cool/617060/">Alex Trebek</a> had died a few weeks earlier, making us all keenly aware of the power and promise of trivia done well.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/11/alex-trebek-made-jeopardy-nerds-look-cool/617060/">Read: How Alex Trebek made a mundane game show brilliant</a></p><p>My own trivia night worked so well because it happened every Sunday, rain or shine, whether the Super Bowl or the Oscars or Valentine’s Day. Every week brought fresh pandemic chaos and insanity, and was so heightened—so optimized and maximalized for madness—that it turned trivia night into a capstone cleansing ritual, a baptism in which we reasserted our internal weirdness over anything external. No trophies or prizes. Each week the top scorer gave an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/09/comedy-improv-anxiety/403933/">improvised assignment</a>—usually an impression—to the low scorer.</p><p>It helped us not lose track of the paradoxical power of pointlessness, of genuine <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/03/sundays-off-leisure/673287/?utm_content=edit-promo&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_term=2023-03-04T16%3A30%3A11">free time</a> (monetized <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/01/history-hobbies-america-productivity-leisure/621150/">hobbies</a> or activities motivated by “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/what-is-quiet-quitting-burnout-at-work/671413/">self-care</a>” don’t count). In a world desperate to normalize everything, we reclaimed the bravery of our weirdness. It helped that we were strangers enjoying one another’s strangeness. Having lost so much time and momentum, and with so many folks consequently demanding that we not allow another minute to go by without advancing our <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/01/self-help-books-new-years-resolutions/672592/">best selves</a>, here we were goofing around in every week’s crucial final <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/psychics-arent-real-designer-electrons/330506/">psychic</a> round, in which we guessed people’s names prompted only by their photo.</p><p>One week I won by correctly identifying Dick Fiddler (the same week I also scored the most <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/shark-tank-nation/544125/"><em>Shark Tank</em>–style</a> investors for my company Bones ‘N’ Things. The pitch: “We got all kinds of bones. Femurs! Clavicles! Skulls! And then also on the side we have, y’know, some things. Some things you probably want. Pretty good things.”). Another week, I correctly identified the 19th-century British General Manley Power and compelled that week’s lowest scorer to do an impression of Captain Crunch’s supervisor explaining why the cereal mascot was being <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/06/20/193875243/hes-an-impostor-the-navy-says-about-capn-crunch">passed up for a promotion</a> yet again.</p><p>Trivia has a magic; it encourages a flow state through a multiverse of memories—of possibilities. Every ping everywhere all at once. The wonder of it all, and its refusal to be optimized, maximalized, or otherwise <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/02/belief-business-scale-up/463017/">scaled</a> toward <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/01/machine-garden-natureless-world/621268/">mechanization</a> compels us to own our own mystery in ways that are inexplicably human, free from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/category/ai-artificial-intelligence/">the artifice of imposed or supposed intelligence</a>.</p><p>While everyone else was prioritizing the tedium of life hacks or the contrivance of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/tiktok-instagram-video-feeds-ai-algorithm/672002/">TikTok trends</a>, we were frolicking in the serendipity of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/08/books-about-obsession/671186/">rabbit holes</a> and a convoluted extrapolation of Truth or Dare.</p><p>One question from pandemic Zoom trivia still resonates with me frequently: In the eighth century, the Venerable Bede determined the exact duration of a moment; how long was it? The answer was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/09/come-again/405403/">90 seconds</a>. Knowing this has given so many minutes since added momentum.  Any moment, however feral or frenzied, has a life span of just 90 seconds. Now is never forever.</p><p>We were and still are definitively in a historic <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/02/will-there-be-another-surge-spring-mystery/617900/">moment of flux</a>—in all the big ways, sure, but also a redefining era for what counts as marginal, incidental, and trivial. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/12/pandemic-end-returning-to-normal-2019-nostalgia/672402/">We are not back to normal and never will be</a>. Anyone calling for that might as well be asking to “Make America normal again.” Instead, we are tasked with rebuilding a new normal out of hope but also out of memory, which is why it’s so important to remember how we spent those pre-pandemic days.</p><p>I<span>n the Network basement, </span>Kayla Nelson—the sonographer daughter of a stenographer and one of the team’s many younger-generation women—was brought to tears by finally discovering the source of a mysterious bird image. It was on an obscure <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1980/07/the-cruelest-game/665236/">backgammon</a> board from 1975. On a whim, because it was the 11th hour of the tournament and no board-game questions had been asked yet, she had googled <em>vintage board-game swan</em> (although most Network players thought it was a dove or a sparrow). She composed herself enough to call in the answer when the time came, to a round of applause.</p><p>Later, Thom Aylesworth, a lawyer from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/04/michelle-wu-changing-traditional-boston/587473/">Boston</a> who had co-founded the group with Heck, was filing the team’s final quibbles to the complaint line. No one was picking up. “Hang up,” said Nick Pionek, Network’s IT guy, from behind his three computer screens. Aylesworth hung up the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/12/families-landline-shared-phone/603487/">landline</a> and Pionek tapped his keyboard. “Okay,” he said, “I’ve changed that phone’s number. Try now.” Dark Lords of Trivia indeed.</p><p>At last, the final question came: “A literary character and his two sons were in town to get 10 bags of feed at the store. The store owner informed them that a prisoner had escaped and was out to kill all three of them. As they were leaving the store, the youngest brother accidently bumped into a young man, knocking him into the street. The young brother tried to apologize but the young man jumped up, pulling his gun, putting it in the brother’s stomach and pulling the trigger. Luckily, nothing happened and the young brother proceeded to give the young man a closed right fist, which caused the young man to collapse. What is the complete name of the young man who collapsed on the street?”</p><p>Heck stood up. “That’s gotta be a Big Little Book,” he said, and began pulling them off the shelves by the armful, onto the conference table covered by laptops and snacks, each book the size of an overstuffed wallet. The whole team descended on the books like locusts, turning the old pages so briskly that some of them tore or crumbled. “Check all the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/07/how-the-western-was-lost-and-why-it-matters/278057/">Westerns</a>! Anything with a cowboy on it! It’s gotta be—”</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/04/rapid-thinkers-take-greater-risks/256469/">Too late</a>.</p><p>“Phones down in the back; that is it for question eight of hour 54, Trivia 5-0,” said the DJ before announcing the answer: the Bubble Gum Kid.</p><p>Network hadn’t even called in a guess. They stood there, at the game’s ungracious finale, amid the chaos of books that now seemed like the flotsam of their sunken hopes. Is this what it felt like to be in the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/04/the-tragedy-of-google-books/523320/">ashes of Alexandria</a> or the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/">rubble of Babel?</a> The silence was deafening. Then they did what all Pointers do at the end of a party: They cleaned up and drank after-party beers in the garage.</p><p>T<span>his is the unifying thread </span>among COVID, the insurrection, the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/great-resignation-quit-job-regret/673346/">Great Resignation</a>, and inflation: stakes. Across the board, the stakes are high. But what matters is how we respond to these stakes. In most conflicts, especially zero-sum scenarios, the response is some form of <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/09/26/crazy-logic-brinksmanship-putin-russia-ukraine-united-states/">brinkmanship</a>—threats and other bullying or imposing tactics. Give us the White House or <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/category/january-6-capitol-insurrection/">we’ll storm the Capitol</a>. Give us the Supreme Court or <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/democrats-case-court-packing/616446/">we’ll expand it in our favor</a>. Give us promotions or <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/09/quiet-quitting-trend-employee-disengagement/671436/">we’ll quit</a>. Give us raises or <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/kim-kelly-interview-labor-unions/629716/">we’ll strike</a>. Give us liberty or give us death. The result too often is a kind of gerrymandering of the soul, a parceling of principles for the sake of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2008/12/pragmatism-they-can-believe-in/55859/">pragmatism</a>, which only works in theory. By its nature, trivia is not that deep.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/08/humor-happiness/619704/">Read: The link between happiness and a sense of humor</a></p><p>These stakes are <a href="https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/the-highlight/22876522/trauma-covid-word-origin-mental-health">traumatic</a>, though, and one of the best-kept secrets in trauma response is to engage in something trivial: a silly game like my own go-to, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/secrets-candy-crush-revealed/313200/">Candy Crush</a> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7828932/">a National Institutes of Health study focused on Tetris,</a> which caused hippocampal increases in the brain, reducing anxiety, depression, and PTSD). Something that can absorb attention in a way that mops up panic or pain. It’s a response that literally blocks traumatic memories from forming. Similarly, trivia contests flex your brain’s frontal cortex. “That’s the first thing to go with injury or with age if we don’t use it,” a psychologist who specializes in neurotherapy explained in a <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/obscure-facts-is-good-for-mental-health"><em>Healthline</em> article</a> about the health benefits of trivia.</p><p>All of our progress over the past few years is admirable, but also <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/10/goop-wellness-culture-self-care-parenting/671699/">exhausting</a>. Our lives would be far more comfortable if they were just a little more trivial.</p><p>On the 55th hour of Trivia Weekend 2019, Network drove to the radio station to collect their trophy. Even at 1:30 a.m., the station was packed with trivia zombies, including babies, elderly women, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/02/the-tactical-kilt-dialectic/385411/">men in kilts</a> or <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2015/12/and-she-never-sets-for-stun/625462/">Princess Leia</a> cosplay, and at least one person in a panda costume (presumably a member of the team Trivial Fursuit).

Their standing was out of 341 total teams. Fifth place in 2020, fifth again in 2021, and sixth in 2022. Not quite winners, but not quite losers either. They are Pointers. And we could all use a few Pointers in our lives every now and then. But especially now.</p><div></div></section>

        <section><p>I RECENTLY received a gift. The occasion for it and the sentiment behind it are not important at the moment. It is of the gift I write, and the pleasure and profit it has afforded me.</p><p>It was a dictionary, but that was not all, for the ponderous volume was mounted upon a curious metal structure designed to stand by my table, and which allowed the book to lie open at any desired page.</p><p>Personally I regarded this arrangement with some suspicion. It seemed to me to be an improper and undignified thing to do to so deserving a book, and I had a lurking distrust of the mechanics of the thing. However, not wishing to appear in any way critical of my gift, I placed it by my table and opened it at random in what appeared to be a safe and comfortable position. For several days I had no occasion to consult it. Never having possessed so compendious a volume, I have developed a habit of avoiding, in my literary labors, any word the spelling of which troubles me, usually using a synonym of which I feel a bit more sure. This, I imagine, may account for the clearness and simplicity of my literary output.</p><p>One day I became conscious of a certain mood of exaltation. I could not explain it. I found myself repeating at intervals, with a sensation of delight, a new and fabulous word. As I went about my humble daily tasks my lips formed it and my senses reveled in it. The word was ‘myzostomous.’ What a rich, full word that is! It suggests all sorts of mystic and agreeable things. But where did it come from? I did not know, but it haunted me and filled my mind with vague imaginings. I even found myself replying to a question from across the table by murmuring absently, ‘Myzostomous, myzostomous.’ Heads were shaken and silence fell.</p><p>Not until evening did I discover the genesis of this new delight. As I sat at my desk I glanced at the book beside me, and in bold type at the top of a page was my new word, ‘myzostomous,’ in upper case. Then I made a mistake which I learned not to repeat. I read the definition. My new word, which had suggested a thousand half-imagined delights, turned out to relate to ‘a genus of parasitic animals found on crinoids.’ I hastily turned the page, disillusioned and sad. But I was rewarded, for my ravished eyes fell upon ‘Oligochæta’ and that gave me a happy though slightly distrait evening.</p><p>From that moment I no longer disapproved of the mechanical environment of my book, for it each day provided a new thrill. The pleasure was heightened when a breeze from an open window, or other accident, turned the pages for me and a new and unexpected word appeared. It was in this way that ‘tarsometatarsus’ came into my life and gladdened it.</p><p>There came a day when domestic calamity followed calamity; frozen pipes, a dying furnace, a sick puppy, and a disabled automobile made it a day to be remembered. To the amazement of my domestic circle I moved serenely from disaster to disaster, unruffled and undisturbed. They little knew that my soul was strengthened and raised above the petty anxieties of worldly affairs by the sonorous accents of ‘epiphenomenalism.’</p><p>The gladness of the holiday season was heightened by the arrival of ‘gymnogynous’ — an agile, sprightly word, the judicious repetition of which I recommend for occasions when a certain jauntiness of manner is desirable, and when, under the stress of continued hilarity, your spirits flag a bit. The same general effect can be achieved by the use of ‘anaglyptograph,’ but the reaction is slower and the result a bit less animated.</p><p>In moments of tranquil solitude and when in reflective mood, ‘sopraporta’ induces thought along agreeable lines and tends to clear the mind of minor irritations.</p><p>Like everything else in this world of compensations, I soon found that care should be exercised in the excessive use of certain words. There seem to be some the effect of which is most unhappy. A longanticipated winter tramp under exhilarating atmospheric conditions was robbed of all stimulation by the brooding presence of ‘Malvaviscus.’ I soon found that ‘orgulous’ could put the touch of death on any occasion. ‘Glioma’ should be avoided except when used as a sedative, and ‘ leucomelanous’ is undoubtedly a depressive.</p><p>There was one red-letter day when two words presented themselves at once. They were sorely needed. I had felt for a long time a crying inadequacy in my vocabulary of expletives. I knew none that quite answered for certain occasions when vehement self-expression was demanded but the requirements of decorum narrowed my choice. Now, however, I am supplied, at least for the present, for I have acquired the twin gems, ‘bezugo’ and ‘bundobust.’ With a little practice in the articulation of the latter, it will be found an almost perfect outlet for repressed feelings, and is not objectionable to the most fastidious.</p><p>Appropriately, in conclusion, I sing the praises of the most perfect word of all. It was acquired only by accident, when the distrusted support of my volume collapsed and threw the tome haphazard at my feet. Disturbed as I was by this unseemly interruption, I was immediately soothed when my eye fell upon ‘zythum.’ That is a word to be remembered and used with entire freedom. It has all the qualities of an emollient, while it avoids being saccharine and offensive. I humbly offer it to a suffering world.</p><p>In this brief and superficial survey of words as healing agencies, justice cannot be done to the subject. I have barely hinted at the possibilities of this new use of words. I should be glad to go more deeply into the subject with anyone who may be interested.</p><div></div></section>

        <section><p>FEW people realize how much entertainment one can get out of a dictionary, if properly used. That rather ponderous volume is seldom given a fair chance, but is treated like a household drudge from year’s end to year’s end, till finally it becomes as uninteresting as a washing-list. All the charm of a dictionary vanishes if it is used as a book of reference: for one thing, because it so often has an awkward way of putting one in the wrong. That is a lesson I learned early in life. As a child I was in the habit of referring to the ‘beheadal of Charles the First,’ that being one of the few dates in English history of which I felt at all sure. One day I happened to mention that melancholy event in the presence of an olderschoolmate, who, justly annoyed by my air of conscious erudition, jumped on me with vigor and dispatch.</p><p>‘Beheadal? There’s no such word.’</p><p>‘I’ll bet you anything you like there is,’ I cried, making for the nearest dictionary with the comfortable conviction that I was betting on a certainty. Need I own to the well-read reader that I lost my bet?</p><p>However, the dictionary, though a bad umpire, can be a delightful companion. Every one knows what it is to have twenty minutes to spare when one feels just in the mood for reading, if only the right thing were at hand. The morning paper has been read; so have the magazines; it does not seem worth while to take up a real book merely to put it down again the moment one is fairly started. To any one placed in this predicament I say: ‘Try the dictionary.’ You will find plenty of good reading, a variety of subject and wealth of vocabulary such as you have never met before, as well as a style which for brevity and exactness is rarely equaled; you can begin anywhere and end at any time. To the over-conscientious I would give a word of advice, — do not be afraid of skipping.</p><p>Lately I have been far afield in a small Japanese-English dictionary, from which I have culled a choice collection of words peculiar to the country, such as: —</p><p><em>An:</em> A small house inhabited by a Buddhist priest.</p><p><em>Araigome:</em> Washed rice offered to idols.</p><p><em>Onden :</em> Rice fields about which a false statement has been made in order to diminish the tax.</p><p>Now, idols are all very well, for even in this country we have idols (of sorts) to whom we devote more precious gifts than much-washed rice. Also, no idol nourished merely on rice will be able long to withstand the assaults of the higher criticism. But it is rather melancholy to find that tax-dodging is not unknown to that most patriotic though by no means lightly taxed nation.</p><p>On the strength of this chunky little volume I have formed an affection for the <em>baku,</em> ‘an animal said to swallow bad dreams and make them good.’ Some enterprising importer would find a ready sale for so benevolent a beast. A <em>baku</em> should certainly be attached to every well-regulated household. Not by children alone would he be received with open arms. In many of the loftier walks of life he would find countless other equally stanch and devoted friends. What prime minister, no matter to which party he belonged, could refuse a certainty of being delivered from the Irish Question, at least during his sleeping hours? What speculator would not hail with joy a release from bearish onslaughts or the fierce attacks of savage bulls, once his head was on the pillow? Thus, wherever the <em>baku</em> went, the gentle creature would grow fat and sleek from much plying of his friendly trade.</p><p>As one would suppose, in a Japanese dictionary the words describing various aspects of nature are very numerous, as for instance:—</p><p><em>Ari-ake:</em> A morning in which the moon is seen.</p><p><em>Yukan:</em> The quiet, tranquil appearance of a distant landscape.</p><p><em>Asayake:</em> The glorious appearance of the sky at sunrise.</p><p><em>Asakage:</em> The long shadows caused by the morning sun.</p><p><em>Yukimi:</em> A party or excursion for looking at the falling snow.</p><p>One could quote indefinitely, but this is enough to prove the poetic possibilities of what is supposed to be a prosaic volume.</p><p>A dictionary of the Russian language should throw some light on the present state of affairs in that country, and show how it happens that with a government quite incapable of governing, the Revolutionary party is nevertheless powerless to put through the revolution they have been dangling for so many weary and bloody months before the eyes of the world. But what can one expect of a people who, besides the curse of a corrupt bureaucracy, have the double burden of the Russian language to handicap their efforts? Take the alphabet alone: its principal object, apparently, is to distract and madden the most long-suffering race in Europe. It pursues this object with a malignant perversity, a diabolical ingenuity, that is positively startling in these days of half measures and milk-and-water convictions. It is all very well to say that the Russians are used to it; so they may be; but this very use has left an indelible imprint on the national character. Eels get used to being skinned, but the skinless state can never be conducive to a bold and active life. How can any one take a word like <em>gara</em> and pronounce it ‘ datcha ' without doing violence to his finer feelings? While to go through life pronouncing <em>crem,</em> ‘schott,’ cannot fail to have a most deplorable effect on a man’s mind by destroying all belief in the connection between cause and effect.</p><p>No, the Russian dictionary is too annoyingly perverse to afford much pleasant reading. It may be instructive, to those unhappy wretches who are struggling with the language, though even in their case one may be permitted to have serious doubts. Certainly, unless one has already a good knowledge of the language, one should never turn to a dictionary for information save in cases of dire necessity, for any dictionary, when degraded from its proper sphere to fill the position of maid-ofall-work, knows how to take a fitting revenge on those who thus misuse it.</p><p>Every traveler has his collection of side-splitting assaults on the English language wrought by the luckless foreigner through the perfidy of the dictionary. My latest treasure-trove of this sort is a small twenty-page pamphlet, called <em>Nouvelle Méthode pour Apprendre VAnglais.</em> And soit is,quite new, — startlingly so in places. At the ‘SilkMercer’s,’ for instance, the obliging salesman, trying to make things easy for the traveling Englishwoman, remarks while displaying his wares, ‘Here is some blue the of green a shethis rosa very pretty.’ This is sheer gibberish, though in comparing it with the French one cannot but admire the ingenuity which turned <em>celle-ci</em> into ‘she-this.’ But the author gives himself and his methods away completely when, mistaking a noun for a feminine adjective, he boldly puts ‘a discovery cab’ as the English equivalent for <em>une voiture découverte,</em> and translates <em>mais je vais conserver vos bagages en garantie, jusqu’à ce que vous me régliez</em> by this never-to-be-forgotten sentence: ‘maize I am going to conserve your luggage in guarantie till you me rule.’</p><p>Doubtless we have all made many such mistakes, of which we are likely to remain blissfully ignorant to the end of our days, luckily for our self-esteem. But as few Americans have the epic courage, the heroic temerity, to follow in the footsteps of our anonymous Frenchman, the moral of this brief exhortation is not, ‘Do not write a French phrase-book unless you have some slight knowledge of the language.’ No, it is merely a hint as to the whereabouts of a rich treasure-house and the proper manner of using its contents. If put to base and utilitarian uses, these will prove a very pitfall for the unwary. Or, to change the metaphor, the dictionary is a rich meadow sprinkled with rare and beautiful flowers which should be sought out one by one and prized for their own sake, not cut down with a mowing-machine and made into bales of useful, but oh, how uninteresting, hay!</p><div></div></section>

   <p>CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy — Here in the Dolomites, with the 2026 Winter Olympics finally underway, there is one sentence heard in recent days more than any other: "If anyone can do it, Lindsey can."</p>   <p>That Lindsey is, of course, Lindsey Vonn, the 41-year-old skiing superstar whose genuinely epic comeback from retirement to compete at these Olympic Games was suddenly thrown into jeopardy just over a week ago when she crashed during a race and tore her left anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL.</p>   <p>Most athletes would bow out after such a serious injury. Instead, Vonn stunned the skiing world by announcing this week that she would compete anyway.</p>   <aside>

   <p>By Saturday, Vonn had successfully completed two official training runs on the course at the Tofane Ski Center, where the women's alpine events are being held, setting the stage for Sunday's race. </p>   <p>"She knows she'll have to push harder tomorrow," said her coach Aksel Lund Svindal after Saturday's training run. "You're not going to get away with a medal unless you push hard, and I think she's ready for that."</p>   <div>

   <p><strong>How can a skier ski on a torn ACL? </strong></p>   <p>The ACL, or the anterior cruciate ligament, connects the femur to the tibia and helps to stabilize the knee as it pivots — meaning it is key to athletes in sports like soccer, hockey and football, said Dr. Timothy Lin, an orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine doctor at Dartmouth Health who has worked with the U.S. ski team.</p>   <p>In other sports, like football, an ACL tear can end an athlete's season. "In the NFL, you are constantly cutting and pivoting," Lin said. "Although you can tear your ACL skiing pretty easily, skiing is not necessarily a cutting and pivoting activity in and of itself."</p>   <p>That's especially true of downhill, the straightest and fastest of the alpine disciplines. Skiers must turn and jump but spend much of the race skiing in line in a tucked position. Because of that, skiing in the downhill race, as Vonn plans to do Sunday, could be less risky than if she was competing in moguls or slopestyle.</p>   <aside>

   <p>In skiing, it's the unexpected crash, he says, that can twist the knee and cause the ACL tear.</p>   <p>But for Vonn, whose specialty is downhill racing — the fastest, straightest form of ski racing — he says, it's less risky than in other disciplines.</p>   <p>"She's going to go side to side, but she's not planting her foot and pivoting on it, hopefully," he said. "You can engage your quads and hamstrings to stabilize the knee in a predictable way."</p>   <p>"It feels stable. I feel strong. My knee is not swollen. And with the help of a knee brace, I am confident that I can compete on Sunday [in the downhill race]," Vonn told reporters earlier this week. </p>   <p><strong>An injury with precedent in skiing</strong></p>   <p>As a result, it's not unheard of for a skier to race after tearing their ACL. In 2022, Team USA skier Breezy Johnson tore hers in January before the Winter Olympics in Beijing, but decided to keep competing.</p>   <p>"I felt like it was totally possible. I knew that it was risky," she told reporters in October. The risk is that the next crash could cause even more severe damage to the knee — which happened to Johnson a few weeks later, forcing her to pull out of the Games.</p>   <p>"There are, I think, more athletes that ski without ACLs and with knee damage than talk about it," Johnson said this week. "People are often unwilling to talk about it because of judgment from the media and the outside."</p>   <p>Key to persevering, said fellow Team USA skier Bella Wright, is Vonn's psychological strength.</p>   <p>"We all know how strong of a skier she is. But I think that her mental game is what makes Lindsey Lindsey," said Wright, who tore her ACL in 2016. "That is what it takes to get through injuries, to get through the trauma, to get through the crashes."</p>   <aside>

   <p>Before the ACL tear, Vonn was the season leader in the FIS downhill standings and had a genuine chance at an Olympic gold medal, which would be the second gold and fourth overall Olympic medal of her storied career.</p>   <p>She acknowledges the chances are no longer as good. But she is determined to compete in the Olympics, and in doing so, complete a comeback story that would be monumental for any athlete in any sport.</p>   <p>"I'm gonna do it. End of story," she said earlier this week. "I'm not crying. My head is high. I'm standing tall. I'm going to do my best, and whatever the result is, that's what it is. But I can never say I didn't try."</p>   <p>On Friday, Vonn successfully completed her first official training run with a time of 1:40.33. It wasn't perfect — she favored her right ski at times, and she took one turn too wide and had to course-correct to pull herself back between the blue lines. Still, out of more than 40 skiers, she finished with the 11th fastest time of the day. Then, Saturday, she skied it even faster, crossing the finish line in 1:38.28. </p>   <p>Svindal felt she showed clear improvement from Friday to Saturday, he said afterward, important because Saturday's conditions were more race-like. The course at Tofane features a handful of jumps that require a hard, flat landing, he said, and a symmetrical landing, with equal weight on both feet, is important to ski the course safely and quickly. </p>   <p>He was nervous then and will be nervous again tomorrow, he said, but in a different way: "Yesterday was about, 'Let's please let this be okay,'" he said. "Tomorrow is like, 'Let's go and be fast.'" </p>

                        <p>ALEX O'CONNOR: Most people instinctively think that there is some kind of meaning to life. They just sort of assume that it's there in the same way that if you ask them, "Why are you getting out of bed to go to work? Why are you doing that to make money? Why to provide for my family? Why to bring up my children healthily? Why because I want my children to be healthy? Why? What do you mean why?" For some people, they just don't recognize the question. They're just like, "What are you talking about?" For other people, they hear that and they go, "Gosh, you know what? Fair enough, I actually don't know." The nihilist is someone who sort of takes a bird's eye view of it and realizes that it's all a little bit meaningless. It is nicer to think that you are here for some kind of reason that's written into the rules of the universe than that it all is just a happy or unhappy accident. My name's Alex O'Connor. I'm the host of the Within Reason podcast. I think I'm best described as a philosophy YouTuber and former edgy atheist. Meaning, I think, is used synonymously with purpose. And purpose is something like reason to act or reason to be. Whenever anybody acts in any way, when I pick up a glass of water to have a drink, when I walk to a bus stop or something, there will be a reason why I've done that. These kinds of behaviors don't just spring up ex nihilo. They exist for some kind of reason. And so if you ask me why it is that I'm reaching my arm over there, it might be because I'm trying to pick up a glass of water. Why am I doing that? I don't just do that randomly. Well, because I'm thirsty. Okay, well, why am I thirsty? Well, now we're kind of into some biological science. You might say, "Well, it's been a while since I've last had a drink." And then you might describe what it is about my biology that causes thirst and you might even give an evolutionary explanation for why it is that we've developed this sensitivity to thirst. And eventually this kind of has to bottom out somewhere. It will either have to bottom out in some evolutionary reason or this contingent chain of reasoning just essentially goes back forever or it terminates in something which is self-justifying. For the religious, it will be God. Everything they do, even if they don't cognize it all the time, will be for the glory of God. And if you're a secular person, it will likely be something else. For some people, their meaning in life might be the raising of their children. And for most people, it probably is relational. And when people say that they found their meaning in life, I think a lot of the time they found that self-justifying principle. The thing that the nihilist recognizes is that the values he or she holds are not grounded in anything other than their own preferences or aesthetic preferences. Nihilism comes in many forms and depending on the context can mean many different things. But most broadly, it's the lack of belief in or belief that there is no such thing as an objective purpose to life or to the actions that we commit and the behaviors that we portray within life. A lot of people think that if you lived like a nihilist, you'd sort of rot away in bed. Some nihilists may do that and I think there is actually a correlation, a strong correlation between philosophical nihilism and practical depression. However, nihilism is not about the actual consequences or the things that you're doing, it's about the purpose behind them, it's about the meaning behind them. And so, suppose that you're feeling thirsty. I could explain to you that the only reason you're feeling thirst is because of some animalistic drive that you had no control over. But you're still thirsty. You still have that desire. You still have that value of quenching your thirst and so you'll still do that. And the same applies in all areas of life, art and music and poetry, but also including relationships, friendships, that kind of stuff. You're still going to want to do those things. It's like Camus famously described in the myth of Sisyphus, this person who suddenly recognizes the structure of their day, waking up, having breakfast, getting in the car, going to work, taking a break, work, going back home, eating some food, going to sleep, starting again. And you sort of start to notice that you're doing this. And it's not anything about what you're doing, it's realizing, taking a step back and realizing that there's no meaning to any of this. There's no... That there's nothing more than just my doing it. It doesn't go any deeper than that. One of the still greatest expositions of nihilism that can be found in the printed word is the book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament. Ecclesiastes takes us through the reflections of this man, this anonymous author. Some have tried to identify him, but it doesn't really matter who it is. We know that he was a great man, a king. He lived an illustrious life, but he saw no meaning in it. And he keeps coming back to this word "hevil," which means literally something like "wind." And so it's translated as "vanity" by the King James. Vanity of vanities. Everything is vanity. Meaningless. Meaningless. Everything is meaningless is one translation. Absurd, absurd. Everything is absurd is my favorite. He's like, "I denied my eyes no pleasure that they saw. If I wanted something, I took it. I drank wine, I partied, I lived life. But in the end, I saw that it was all "hevil." It was all just wind. It's just... Nothing. It just happens. And then it's gone. And it doesn't mean anything. But the most interesting thing is that it seems to suggest that everything that this guy was saying was true, that it is all just wind, but that somehow, by just fearing God and keeping His commandments, you have somehow solved the problem. I don't think that that's a very satisfying solution. But then I think that that is the great theme of nihilistic literature. People try for a kind of solution, but ultimately, for me, at least, they seem relatively unsatisfying. Fast forward thousands of years and you get Albert Camus' Myth of Sisyphus, which famously ends with this idea of imagining Sisyphus happy. In fact, Camus was celebrated for the starkness of the opening line of the myth of Sisyphus, that there is one serious philosophical question, and that is suicide. Because everything else, you know, how many dimensions there are to space, whether abstract numbers exist, all of that is secondary. The most foundational question is whether or not you're going to, as he once put it, have a cup of coffee or kill yourself today. You look at the seeming arbitrariness of the world around us, the way that the environment and the organisms within it seem to just sort of almost randomly evolve according to literal just battles for survival. I think people want something a little bit more than that. They want something which feels worthwhile, that's somehow sort of justified by some universal principle. There's almost like a moral element, that it's a good thing to be alive, that it's a good thing to live a meaningful life. And that kind of thing, I think, is very difficult to ground objectively. In fact, if somebody ever asks me how I might console myself in the face of these existential woes, genuinely, at least personally, it is in agnosticism. It's in the fact that I do not know the first thing about why any of this exists. Of course I don't, you know? And sometimes people ask me in a context on a podcast or on a stage or something, implicitly as if I'm going to have some answer, as if I've like worked it out and I'm going to be able to communicate that to people. And I'm interested in philosophy, so I might have read something that helps to elucidate a concept or I might be able to put a word on something that you've been thinking but didn't know was, you know, also thought by other people. But we're doing the same thing here and ultimately I have absolutely no idea what the ultimate answers are. And so that kind of consoles me. And I suppose I'm just not convicted of nihilism.</p>                    </div>

<p>“Epstein collected powerful people the way others collect frequent flyer points,” said Mark Stephens, a specialist in international and human rights law at Howard Kennedy in London. “But the receipts are now in public, and some might wish they’d traveled less.”</p>

<p>The documents were published after a public frenzy over Epstein became a crisis for President Donald Trump’s administration and led to a rare bipartisan effort to force the government to open its investigative files. But in the U.S., the long-sought publication has not brought the same public reckoning with Epstein’s associates — at least so far.</p>

<p>Rob Ford, a professor of political science at the University of Manchester, said that in Britain, “if you’re in those files, it’s immediately a big story.”</p><p>“It suggests to me we have a more functional media, we have a more functional accountability structure, that there is still a degree of shame in politics, in terms of people will say: ‘This is just not acceptable, this is just not done,’” he said.</p>

<h2>British repercussions</h2><p>U.K. figures felled by their ties to Epstein include the former Prince Andrew — who paid millions to <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-andrew-virginia-giuffre-lawsuit-settlement-8b04c775aa46f761d81c05ef12e3a94f">settle a lawsuit</a></span> with one of Epstein’s victims and is facing <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/epstein-andrew-mountbattenwindsor-emails-96754cc6fcb500b2177807c3e4fb2d05">pressure to testify</a></span> in the U.S. — and his ex-wife <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/sarah-ferguson-duchess-york-epstein-andrew-b7cd2158ef6bd2ac06ad06e8b2f3dbd5">Sarah Ferguson</a></span>, whose charity shut down this week.</p><p>Like others now ensnared, veteran politician Mandelson long downplayed his relationship with Epstein, despite calling him “my best pal” in 2003. The new files reveal contact continued for years after the financier’s 2008 prison term for sexual offenses involving a minor. In a July 2009 message, Mandelson appeared to refer to Epstein’s release from prison as “liberation day.”</p><p>Starmer <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-mandelson-epstein-fc3f953112ac10108e1109920fd9dca0">fired Mandelson</a></span> in September over earlier revelations about his Epstein ties. Now British police are investigating whether Mandelson committed misconduct in public office by passing on sensitive government information to Epstein.</p><p>Starmer has apologized to Epstein’s victims and pledged to release public documents that will show Mandelson lied when he was being vetted for the ambassador’s job. That may not be enough to stop furious lawmakers trying to eject the prime minister from office over his failure of judgment.</p>

<h2>American associates</h2><p>Experts caution that Britain shouldn’t be too quick to pat itself on the back over its rapid reckoning with Mandelson. The U.S. has a better record than the U.K. when it comes to declassifying and publishing information.</p><p>But Alex Thomas, executive director of the Institute for Government think tank, said “there is something about parliamentary democracy,” with its need for a prime minister to retain the confidence of Parliament to stay in office, “that I think does help drive accountability.”</p><p>A few high-profile Americans have faced repercussions over their friendly ties with Epstein. Most prominent is former U.S. Treasury Secretary <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/epstein-larry-summers-openai-302a596efd87ab8e725ba8f72eeef84b">Larry Summers</a></span>, who went on leave from academic positions at Harvard University late last year.</p><p>Brad Karp quit last week as chair of top U.S. law firm Paul Weiss after revelations in the latest batch of documents, and the National Football League said it would investigate Epstein’s relationship with New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch, who exchanged sometimes crude emails with Epstein about potential dates with adult women.</p>

<p>Other U.S. Epstein associates have not yet faced severe sanction, including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, who exchanged hundreds of texts with Epstein, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who accepted an invitation to visit Epstein’s private island, and tech billionaire Elon Musk, who discussed visiting the island in emails, but says he never made the trip.</p><p>Former President Bill Clinton has been compelled by Republicans to testify before Congress about his friendship with Epstein. Trump, too, has repeatedly faced questions about his ties to Epstein. Neither he nor Clinton has ever been accused of wrongdoing by Epstein’s victims.</p>

        <div><div></div><p>The theme? “Harmony.” But as the opening ceremonies (yes, plural) of the 2026 <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/t/olympics/">Olympics</a> in Milan-Cortina unspooled across multiple locations on Friday, the theme of “harmony” felt more necessary — and harder to capture — than ever.</p>



<p>Overall, it proved to be a more sedate and traditional opening <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/commentary/paris-2024-olympics-opening-ceremony-review-1235030182/">than Paris’ divisive 2024 offering</a>. Less out-there, sure, but a little too much <em>been</em>-there.</p>



<p>The ceremony kicked off at 8 p.m. local time (11 a.m. PT and 2 p.m. ET for my fellow Americans, a very nice way to spend a winter Friday). The majority of the festivities were held at Milan’s 76,000-capacity San Siro stadium, but with this Olympics officially taking place in both Milan <em>and </em>Cortina, smaller events ran in tandem at Cortina d’Ampezzo (about 250 miles northeast of Milan) and in hubs like Livigno and Bormio in the Valtellina valley; Tesero and Predazzo in the Fiemme Valley; and the Antholz-Anterselva valley on the Austrian border.

<p>Because of the <em>two </em>host cities, there were two cauldrons lit by the iconic Olympic torch at the conclusion of the ceremony: one in Arco della Pace (Arch of Peace) in Milan and one at Cortina d’Ampezzo’s main square.</p>



<p>Athletes walked as part of the traditional parade that ends the ceremony proper — easily and forever my favorite part of any opening ceremony — in whichever location they chose. Some of the best editing of the entire endeavor was on display here, seamlessly cutting between each location to <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/commentary/los-angeles-2028-olympics-embrace-hollywood-1235035484/">show off their various contingents</a> in — oh gosh, is it true? can it be? — <em>harmony.</em>

<p>In the arena, however, there was a different sense of not only what this looked like, but how it felt. A friend in attendance at Milan said that the energy of the entire effort felt weak, and the athlete parade felt oddly empty. “There’s barely anyone in the arena,” she texted me. “Just figure skating, speed skating, and hockey.” That’s also why when the Canadian team emerged, cheers were so loud. Everyone was “just happy to see people.”</p>



<p>Before that? About 45 minutes of showmanship, pageantry, and some mixed attempts to lean into the theme that didn’t live up to the easy joy of the athlete parade. At least there were no less than <em>three </em>giant dancing heads to keep up the weird spirit of Paris. <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/news/breaking-news/tom-cruise-olympics-closing-ceremony-1235035095/">There was no Tom Cruise</a>. (There’s still time, Tom.)</p>

<p>Interpretative dance still seems to be en vogue when it comes to these sorts of events — no need to worry about words, let your body carry you, which does indeed fit nicely with the notion of athletic excellence — and the ceremony opened with dozens of angelic dancers mixing, mingling, and reaching out to the audience as well as each other. Inspired by Milan’s own opera house, Teatro alla Scala, and some of the country’s most timeless works of art (large-scale marble busts were at each corner of the “stage”), it offered a classy, soothing start to the festivities.

<p>Things soon got cinematic, with a “La Dolce Vita”-inspired second segment (cinephiles everywhere were heard screaming, “viva cinema!”) that also, somehow, honored other great Italian traditions, like paparazzi (??) and classic composers Gioachino Rossini, Giuseppe Verdi, and Giacomo Puccini (thanks to dancers wearing giant papier-mâché heads of each, my personal favorite way to be honored).</p>



<p>One announcer gleefully proclaimed, “Some art is about to happen!” as giant tubes of red, blue, and yellow paint appeared above, and began “pouring” colors on the dancers below. I, too, love art. Costumed dancers popped up, dressed as various recognizable pieces of Italian culture, from miniature Colosseums to, I am fairly certain, <em>multiple</em> stove-top espresso makers. Later, there was a disco number. </p>



<p>Harmonious? Not really, but still, quite entertaining in its whiz-bang, “do you know <em>this </em>was Italian, too?!” spectacle.</p>



<p>Then, some real art happened: Mariah Carey performed her own rendition of the 1958 Eurovision Song Contest classic “Nel blu dipinto di blu,” better known worldwide as “Volare,” <em>in Italian. </em>Framed as a medley with her own “Nothing Is Impossible,” it was reserved in a way that felt at odds with the perennially  dancing big-headed opera superstars, gyrating just off stage. They would have <em>loved </em>the water-dancing horse from Paris.

<p>What’s more Italian than Giorgio Armani? Dozens of women wearing Giorgio Armani suits in the colors of the Italian flag. At the end of their seemingly unending lines? Model Vittoria Ceretti, dressed all in white, who presented the Italian flag to a gentleman who then “passed” it (via the magic of technology and good, old-fashioned editing) to the Cortina contingent, miles away. Soon, everyone was asked to stand (if able!) for the Italian national anthem, sung by Laura Pausini. (Helpful <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/t/nbc/">NBC</a> graphics informed viewers she’s a Grammy and Golden Globe-winning artist, which sure felt like a way to inject some very American sensibility into the entire thing.)</p>



<p>Finally (<em>finally</em>) things got, if not weird, at least a little Gothic, zinging to the mountains around Antholz to a very talented violinist playing in the middle of a moon-lit snow field, lit only by flaming lanterns. Now <em>this </em>is what we want to see! Alas, no sooner had I started Googling his name (Giovanni Andrea Zanon), we were back in Milan, where Zanon then magically (aka <em>editing</em> magic) appeared in the stadium to finish playing.

<p>At this point, I began to ponder the nature of “harmony” — though I was temporarily distracted by the appearance of two giant floating rings, which seemed positively demonic, even if they are very standard markers of the Olympics — and how it might be reflected in this ceremony. The rings? They started to rise! “Are these two damn things just gonna smush together, and that’s gonna have to suffice for ‘harmony’?,” I wondered. Nope! Instead, the two people standing in the middle of each ring jumped out, embraced each other, and floated downward — harmony by way of weak Cirque du Soleil inspiration.</p>



<p>And, then, well, they got me. Our two rings? Soon, there were five, and yes, they joined into a magical, massive, and only slightly demonic Olympics symbol in the middle of the stadium. Yes, they looked too orange (demonic!) and when they sparked, I worried about the safety of those below, but it did finally spell a moment of, yes, harmony.  </p>

<p>The ceremony was overseen by Marco Balich and his Banijay-owned events company Balich Wonder Studio. Balich is no stranger to Olympics glory, and he has been involved in 15 Olympic ceremonies over the course of his career, including Salt Lake City in 2002, Turin in 2006, Sochi in 2014, and Rio in 2016.

<p>Numbers-wise, <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/2026-winter-olympics-opening-cermony-what-to-expect-1236708858/">Deadline reported earlier</a> that the ceremony will include 3,500 athletes and more than 1,300 performers, feature 182 original designs, more than 1,400 costumes and 1,500 pairs of shoes, with 110 make-up artists and 70 hair stylists working behind the scenes.</p>



<p>While preliminary heats have already kicked off for a number of events — I watched some women’s hockey and mixed doubles curling before the big event started, while luge, snowboarding, and alpine skiing events played elsewhere — Friday night’s big event inevitably feels like the true beginning. Let’s hope for a bit more energy over the next few days.</p>



<p><em>If you didn’t catch the ceremony live, a primetime cut will be available on Friday evening, starting at 8 p.m. ET on NBC. It will also be live-streamed via DirecTV, Sling, Hulu + Live <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/t/tv/">TV</a>, and <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/t/peacock/">Peacock</a>. </em></p>

<h2>1.</h2>

<p><strong>Tracy* was in her basement</strong> in Colorado Springs, getting ready to watch a Colorado Avalanche hockey game on a Sunday in June 2022, when she called the coroner’s office in Dallas. Her wife, Jen, was out, so Tracy was alone. The woman at the coroner’s office was kind, Tracy remembers, and slow to confirm which unclaimed bodies were there. Something shifted in their conversation when Tracy described the triangular tattoo on her son’s left forearm. When the woman asked for his dental records, Tracy knew that he had died.</p>

<p><em>*To protect their privacy, some individuals in this story are identified by their first name only.</em></p>

<p>Ben’s body had been found face up in a creek in a leafy residential neighborhood on March 9. The autopsy, as Tracy understood it, showed that he had used methamphetamine, which stopped his heart, and that he suffered from exposure. He died held by a tree overhanging the water.</p>

<p>As a child, Ben had been a gifted swimmer who made it to the state championships year after year “without even trying,” Tracy says. “His breaststroke was out of this world.” At meets, before the whistle blew, he’d do the Macarena on the block. It gave Tracy some peace to know that her child had been drawn to the water, that he had wanted to get high, not die; and that, though he did die, at the age of 23, it was in a tranquil place, near a footbridge, beneath trees.</p>

<p>Ben had been a precocious child, who learned to read at age four from old Dick and Jane books. Tracy’s photos show him beautiful and glad, in train-patterned jammies, in OshKosh overalls, in a Sea World wet suit. His childhood in the small riverside town of Salida, Colorado, was sweet and ordinary: elementary school and its birthday parties, even if he was never the first friend invited and was sometimes the last.</p>

<p>Were the signs of his future suffering there all along? Tracy doesn’t know. But Ben would “have a total meltdown,” she said, if Max, his younger brother, “slobbered on his toys.” Certain textures were a problem. He didn’t like to get his hands dirty. When he lost the science fair that “he’d kind of half-assed,” he wasn’t disappointed, he was undone.</p>

<p>In sixth grade, Ben befriended a girl named Emily. She was the first person who ever truly accepted him, he told his mother. Emily was in remission from cancer, but when it returned the next year, she died. Ben told his mom that he could sense his friend’s presence in his room. Then he sensed an evil spirit in his brother’s room.</p>

<p>Maybe he was a medium? He thought he was medium. He’d been watching a show about one in Long Island. Perhaps there were mediums and her child was one. “Heck if I know,” Tracy says.</p>

<p>Tracy is a Gen X athlete, white with a slender build, light-filled blue-green eyes, and a small diamond stud in her nose. She’s quick to see the beauty in other people’s lives. As Ben changed, Tracy did, too. She went back to college to become a probation officer, after being a full-time mother to Ben and Max. Though she was married to their father, Ted, “a good man,” she wasn’t happy. When they separated in 2012, she thought she might be gay. She soon met Jen, who lived in Colorado Springs, and the two fell in love.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ben struggled to leave the house. His grief for Emily only grew. In seventh grade, he “could not stay organized,” Tracy says. The changes that came with middle school, moving to different classrooms and teachers—they overwhelmed him. This child who had always been known as uncommonly intelligent, and who cherished that identity, began to get B’s, then C’s. By the end of the eighth grade, Ben—now out as gay—was flunking every class.</p>

<p>Tracy was coaching volleyball, working full-time, and going through a divorce. She was living check to check but felt too ashamed to ask for help.</p>

<p>In August 2013, she started working in Springs, as she calls it. Her two kids went back and forth between her place and their dad’s. On October 29, she got a call from her ex in Salida. Something was very wrong with Ben. Tracy drove midway to Cañon City, a town known for its rock climbing and supermax prison, to pick up her son. He looked sick to her: pale and too thin. “He was so dehydrated that his lip was split open and bleeding,” Tracy says. He had just turned fifteen.</p>

<p>Something was trying to get into Ben’s body. That’s what he’d woken his father in the middle of the night, in terror, to say.</p>

<p>Tracy drove Ben to the nearest emergency room, where he was treated for anxiety. He was given Xanax—one of the most prescribed psychotropic medications in the United States—stabilized, and released, but they barely made it through the night. “And now it’s Halloween,” Tracy says, narrating what followed.</p>

<p>She remembers how her child was in the back of the car, holding his shirt up to his shoulders, showing her, begging her. What was trying to get inside of him? What was trying to take his soul?<strong></strong></p>

<p>Tracy took Ben to Cedar Springs, a private psychiatric hospital on a handsome, century-old campus, and he agreed to a stay that would last over a week. In addition to the Xanax, doctors gave him Risperdal, an anti-psychotic. Why would he need that if this was anxiety, Tracy wondered?</p>

<figure><img src="https://magazine.atavist.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dip_1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Tracy and Ben</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>In 2012,</strong> Ben began taking photos and posting them online: the braided trunk of a money tree, the aquamarine lanes of an outdoor swimming pool, a skillful self-portrait in pencil, kayaks leaning against a wall. “Death is sweet. Death is Life,” one caption reads. “Celtic knot I invented. It never ends,” goes another. More often the descriptions are funny. A picture of a red Solo cup is captioned, “Red solo cup.” A bowl of edamame: “Nothing a little edamame can’t fix.”</p>

<p>Some of the photos are posted under the name Eden Sealwood, which Ben briefly used at school and online. Elsewhere he was Eleanor. At home he was Ben, and remained so all his life. For an Instagram account, showing its owner’s soft blue eyes and elegant Roman nose, he was Benedetto Scango, an Italian form of his given name. Then, in his first semester of college in Gunnison, Colorado, Ben took the unisex Arabic name Nasim, the last name Hefran, and she/her and they/them pronouns. </p>

<p>Ben knew he was queer. There was not enough time of sustained mental health to see how she, he, or they would have flourished and made a life, whether as female and trans, male and gay, or nonbinary. Tracy would have welcomed any of those identities. She speaks of her beloved child as he was to family—as he, Ben, him. But she brightens to think of Ben as her daughter, someone she never had the chance to really know. Maybe Nasim was a “trailblazer,” Tracy says, early and brave.</p>

<p>“On our way to Mauii!” reads a caption on one of Ben’s pictures, from June 9, 2014. Tracy and Jen were wed on a beach in Hawaii. Photos show them beaming in white dresses, with Jen’s daughter between them, and Ben and Max on either side. But that trip “was a long ten days,” Tracy says. Ben locked himself in a bathroom, terrified of a tsunami and seeking what he always struggled to find: a place to feel safe.</p>

<p>Life at home in the years that followed was sometimes “chaos,” Tracy says, or “hell.”</p>

<p>She took two short phone videos in November 2020, desperate for someone to see what her child was enduring. The lens is close on Ben’s back. He’s dressed in a worn brown waffle shirt with holes along the neck, a talisman he wore often. He is very thin. His hands are raised up, fingers apart. His curly hair is long. He is making a rhythmic and muscular sound of exertion. It’s as if he’s pushing mightily <em>against</em> something, struggling ­­to repel it, to force it away<em>.</em> There is no solace in the sound. It is a sound of agony.</p>

<p>Then words, very quickly, with something like hope: “Jesus hears me.”</p>

<p>Tracy is not religious, and Ben was not raised in any church, but like many people who have experienced the crucible of profound mental illness, he called out for language and meaning older and more encompassing than what the medical models offer.</p>

<p>The bracing work begins again. Ben turns to his mother after another grievous bout and looks relieved. “I barely did it. I barely did it.”</p>

<p>“You did it,” Tracy says, her voice calm and encouraging.</p>

<p>Then, “Oh, my God!” Ben wails. “I touched my hands together.”</p>

<p>Ben is sure that if he touches his hands together, he will lose his soul. So in addition to all the other effort, there is this: He has to keep his hands apart.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t do that,” Tracy says, matter-of-fact. “Don’t touch your hands together.”</p>

<p>The quality of the footage is poor, and the camera is often pointed toward the ceiling—Tracy is filming with one hand, comforting her child tenderly with the other.</p>

<p>Ben says something that can’t be understood. You still have your soul, Tracy reassures him. He needs her to say it again, and in a specific way.</p>

<p>There is the sound of anguished crying, and words that are unclear under the burden of pain.</p>

<p>Then, “<em>No!</em>” he shouts. “I think I just lost my soul!”</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t,” Tracy says. “No, you didn’t.”</p>

<p>The pained sounds begin again, fiercer, louder, more awful.</p>

<p>There’s Tracy’s hand, in the next clip, holding up Ben’s lovely hair.</p>

<p>“Mama, say—” He is crying.</p>

<p>“I swear you have your soul.” Tracy’s voice is calm.</p>

<p>“Mom, promise me.”</p>

<p>“I promise you, you have your soul.”</p>

<p>The crying that follows is softer, like maybe what Tracy said is true.</p>

<h2>2.</h2>

<p><strong>This is the story</strong> of three mothers of three children who were diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood with “a polygenetic … heterogenous spectrum of psychotic disorders that are neurodevelopmental and, when not optimally managed, neurodegenerative,” in the words of Dr. Robert Laitman. Or: schizophrenia. The mothers live in the largest city in the U.S. above 6,000 feet. That city is Colorado Springs. It is a place bedecked with blue skies. Sometimes those skies seem to sparkle, and there is a real song of a mountain looking out over the meager offerings of this civilization: strip malls; the Gas &amp; Grass, a gas station chain that sells weed; and the wide roads that lead to them.</p>

<p>“I’m scared of him,” an old friend of Tracy’s said of Ben. “I don’t want anything to do with him.” A colleague told her, “Some people just aren’t meant to be in this world.” Tracy can’t think of a friend she could confide in about her child’s illness, “until, like, Elisabeth.”</p>

<p>Elisabeth is my older sister, and older sister describes her way of being in the world, too. She and Tracy met in the spring of 2020, through a Zoom support meeting run by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) during the COVID shutdown. Tracy remembers that Elisabeth and her husband, Corey, were sitting on their bed. Corey kept getting up and moving around. Elisabeth was crying. Their 16-year-old son, Luc, had a shifting series of mental health diagnoses and a DUI for cannabis, and they needed help. </p>

<p>Tracy told Elisabeth that she was in the system, a probation officer. Elisabeth and Corey were in that system, too, the one that’s supposed to be a “net.” Corey works at a soup kitchen that serves the unhoused, many of them mentally ill. Elisabeth is a nurse practitioner and medical director at a health clinic that primarily serves refugees, and was formerly on a medical team that helped survivors of sexual assault, often in one of the city’s emergency rooms. From their work, Elisabeth and Tracy knew a great many people in common, and they began texting that night.</p>

<p>“He’s hard to reach,” Elisabeth remembers her sister-in-law saying, about Luc. That’s not what anyone would have said of him as a child, when he was an absorbed enthusiast: of hot-air balloons and dinosaurs and all things John Deere. He was a fast little runner and a riveting performer, with beautiful features on his beautiful face. But by early adolescence, Luc did often seem apart while present, “hard to reach.”</p>

<p>What might have been ordinary—a teenager adrift—became alarming. His sixteenth birthday party was just family, no friends. Elisabeth would watch Luc in the yard from the kitchen window, alone on the swing they’d hung for a much younger child. Who was he talking to? There was no one there. What was he laughing at? She couldn’t see.</p>

<p>One day, Luc told his parents that his camera was broken, the Sony a6300 he’d used to take exquisite photographs: of children’s faces at a party; of scenes in a village in Haiti, where his family once lived; of the sand dunes and skies of Colorado. It won’t focus, he said. They took it to a camera shop for him. No, the technician reported back, the camera worked just fine. Perhaps the lens could use a little cleaning?</p>

<p>It was his Mamaw’s birthday in March 2020 when Luc got arrested for the DUI. A few months later, Elisabeth and Corey asked Luc’s grandparents, my parents, for a meeting outside, the four of them in masks. Luc was spitting out or refusing any food Elisabeth cooked, sure that she was poisoning him. He was convinced that his parents were evil. He’d left a piece of paper on the kitchen counter, addressed to no one, to everyone. “Tell them I need to dye my brain pink,” he wrote, “and I need to do soul studying.”</p>

<p>“We’re in trouble,” Elisabeth told our parents. Our father got out a yellow legal pad and began taking notes.</p>

<p>Tracy helped expunge Luc’s record. When his probation officer told Elisabeth that she didn’t like a menacing look Luc had made, Tracy talked to her colleague. “You better be good to Luc,” she said.</p>

<p>Things would get better, and then they would get worse. One evening in the summer after his DUI arrest, Luc broke his wrist when he jumped his father, a gentle man who did not strike back. His mother called the police, like his father would a year later, when Luc was found at midnight starting fires in the driveway with a gas can and lighter fluid.</p>

<p>The door to Luc’s bedroom was removed. His parents installed a lock on theirs. His younger brother and sister got locks and alarms.</p>

<p>It was too painful to grieve. To survive, Elisabeth had to think like a nurse. What would she do if this beloved child, perfectly made, her firstborn, were her patient? She would chart—so that’s what she did, casting herself in the third person. She charted hospitalizations, providers, medications a.m., p.m., and p.r.n. (<em>pro re nata</em>, or as needed). She tracked “medications Luc has tried and failed”—the antipsychotics, SSRIs, non-SSRIs, and stimulants, some of which made him feel low, others as if he were “disassociated from his body.” She remembers being upstairs one day when she heard Luc repeatedly vomiting downstairs. She didn’t know what was wrong, then the next step came to her: When you’re stuck, “you refer, you refer out.” She took him to the ER, where he was diagnosed with lithium toxicity. Elisabeth’s charting practice both helped to save Luc’s life—here was documentation—and made his doctors and nurses uneasy. Why was “Mom” so clinical?</p>

<p>Some notes Elisabeth took:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>6/10/21 Probation today. Slept moderate (do we do a scale?). Not angry with anyone, even me when talking to probation. But delayed responses, tangential thinking. Perseverating on breaking into the design industry—not swayed by practicality. Even after Mary at probation explained the importance of doing what is asked in therapy, he still thinks he can alter the plan—it’s not clicking. Not a lot of humor but have seen smiles—almost like responding to internal stimuli at times.…</em></p>



<p><em>6/25/21 After lack of sleep and a rougher week—emotionally draining for us, lots to think about for Luc—he seemed catatonic yesterday. You could ask him a question several times and he would just stare at you. Sat on the couch most of the day without moving or responding to everyone around him. </em></p>



<p><em>7/7/21 Luc very agitated—began following Elisabeth around the house calling her “evil” and certain she is “going to hell”—refused to leave E and C’s bedroom and began opening and closing drawers. Corey got home and made Luc go outside—Luc forced his way back in. Called 911.</em></p>



<p><em>7/14/21 Worst day of the week for Luc. Suspicious of Mamaw and Dad. Luc reported Corey and Mamaw’s speech as “garbled.” Would not let Corey be within 10 feet of him—concern for manipulation of his mind if Corey got too close. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a record, too, of all the ways Luc tried, while in psychosis, to get out of it. He meditated with an app, a cushion, a Tibetan singing bowl. He joined his Mamaw at breakfast and Mass. He joined his cousins at a swimming pool, even if he needed to stay in a lawn chair off to the side.</p>

<p>Luc attended high school over Zoom during the first year of COVID. His Mamaw and Grandpa Ray took turns helping him with it, as he could not complete the assignments on his own. His Mamaw recalls how they would break often to take a walk and Luc would talk about his plan to live in Iceland. It struck her as “another name for a place too far for his illness to reach.”</p>

<p>One day he told her that he couldn’t talk to her anymore, because she wasn’t his Mamaw. She looked like his Mamaw, he explained, but she had a different voice. “Some being who meant us ill had taken over my body,” she says. “He couldn’t trust it. He needed to go home.”</p>

<figure><img src="https://magazine.atavist.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dip_2-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Luc and Elisabeth</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Imagine this: </strong>While you are showering, or making your coffee, or listening to music, a voice or several, known or new to you, quiet or very loud, are saying things so vile that you do not want to disturb anyone else with what you are hearing. Those voices are more insistent than the music playing, the coffee brewing, or the water running in the shower. They seem to know you. Now try to think while you’re hearing those voices. Now try to <em>act.</em></p>

<p>The first time this happened to Luc, he was at his paternal grandparents’ house, playing a video game. He told no one. A year later, when the voices instructed him to strangle his cat, he asked to be committed rather than risk harming the animal in his care. At the hospital, he was prescribed lithium. He got out on Christmas Eve. The next day, at dinner, he could not eat the food on his plate because his hands were shaking, a side effect of the drug.</p>

<p>Elisabeth calls the voices “auditory hallucinations,” language that is medical, accurate, and deprives the symptom of the significance that makes people unkind to those who suffer it, when any of us would buckle under its burden. Sometimes the auditory hallucinations Luc experienced were encouraging, if outsize. Fame was promised; celebrities spoke. He was Jesus. He was going to be bigger than Elon Musk. There would be great and exceptional triumphs. Sometimes the voices were accompanied by a mania that shimmered in Luc, like a house at night with all the lights on. Mostly, though, the auditory hallucinations were wicked, fixated on sexual violence, racist lies, and elaborate and repeated instructions of how to kill oneself.</p>

<p>At Luc’s graduation from an alternative high school, he was one of two students given the Phoenix Award, for rising; the other was homeless. Luc summoned great courage to give a brief speech that day. The whole time he was at the podium, a hallucination was telling him to say the N-word. With great effort, he fought back against what he knew to be evil, and did not say it.</p>

<p>Hallucinations are a characteristic symptom of schizophrenia, but doctors were hesitant to diagnose Luc with the illness—even medical professionals are subject to its stigma. His parents were told that he had drug-induced psychosis, depression, anxiety, ADHD, autism, and bipolar II. “This is not bipolar,” Elisabeth told one psychiatrist. When a different therapist asked Elisabeth and Corey if they had a family history of schizophrenia, they felt a surprising thing: relief.</p>

<p>Elisabeth’s notes about Luc for July 21, 2021, begin “took to the hospital.” She and Corey had spent that morning looking for Luc. He would sometimes wander on foot or set out on his bike and get lost, because “he was responding to internal stimulation.” He wasn’t at the grocery store. He wasn’t at the park. He wasn’t at the shop where he sometimes stole film. He wasn’t at the library, and the guard there refused to say if he’d seen him.</p>

<p>Desperate, Elisabeth reached out to a friend who worked in an emergency room. The friend told Elisabeth that if they could get Luc to the hospital, she’d put him on an M-1 hold, the term in Colorado for an involuntary seventy-two-hour mental health evaluation, which can only be ordered by law enforcement or a health care professional, usually a doctor. When Luc was lighting fires in the driveway, his father had asked the police for an M-1 hold, but Luc was not an “imminent danger to self or others,” the police said, because they hadn’t <em>seen</em> him light those fires.</p>

<p>Elisabeth smoked one cigarette, then another, a habit she’d given up years before but needed now. Luc finally came home. To get her sick child to the hospital, she came up with a lie.</p>

<p>“Your probation officer called,” she said. “You missed a drug test.”</p>

<p>On the walk to the car, Luc photographed his mother and father repeatedly with a camera that had no film in it. He was suffering from paranoia that day, and he wanted to document what they were doing to him.</p>

<p>The guards at the hospital did not like this guy taking pictures. Luc said that he would not allow his vitals to be taken unless he could photograph it. Security took his camera anyway.</p>

<p>Think of what this family had going for it: two married parents, both educated, with insurance and two incomes, who knew how the medical system worked; a large and helpful extended family, including an uncle who was a psychiatrist; whiteness; social capital in the form of friends like the behavioral-health clinician who agreed to issue the M-1. Crucially, their son was seventeen, still a minor, so they could act on his behalf. Now imagine trying to get care for a child with serious mental illness if you have a job with no paid time off; if you’re intimidated by doctors, live in your car, don’t speak English; or if you’re just too damn tired.</p>

<p>Before Luc entered Care Unit Four, the locked ward, the staff took everything from him, a disorienting experience that would happen each time he was hospitalized. There was a whiteboard and dry-erase marker in the exam room where Luc waited. He called the diagnosis before his doctors did. On the board he wrote:</p>

<p><em>Christ</em></p>

<p><em>Schizophrenia</em></p>

<p><em>Why won’t you listen to me</em></p>

<h2>3.</h2>

<p><strong>On a Friday night</strong> in April 2017, Felicia got a text from her son Quentin. She’d just had a great date with her husband, Will. “It’s eleven o’clock, we’re hanging out, and Quentin sends me this real long text,” she recalls. It was about what he was learning in college, Felicia says, and how “he should be dead or in jail and that he knows that he beat the system.”</p>

<p>Quentin is a Black man who was then a sophomore at Colorado State University Pueblo, where he played defensive end on the football team. His insights in the text were not wrong, Felicia says, but “just the whole vibe of it was weird. I messaged him back, he didn’t answer. I tried to call, he didn’t pick up.” She showed the message to Will. She reached out to her daughters. “Oh yeah, Mom, he’s having some kind of spiritual thing and he’s <em>woke</em>,” Qiana, her firstborn, told her.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, Quentin called Felicia back. “He went on a whole ramble,” Felicia says. He claimed that he’d been abused by his uncle as a child. “He said, ‘Mom I’ve had this vision, these vivid images.’ ” Felicia called Quentin’s father and stepmother, who lived in Connecticut. They were worried, too. She decided to drive south from her home in Colorado Springs to Quentin’s campus.</p>

<p>She found him on the quad. “Quentin is sitting in the middle of the field, no shirt on, just like <em>staring</em> into the sun,” Felicia says. He ran over to her, and she noticed that he smelled awful. “I pulled all my money out of the bank,” he said. “Mom, the end of the world is happening.” Felicia wondered if he’d taken something.</p>

<p>Quentin’s family brought him home to Colorado Springs. They tried to get him to eat, to shower, but he wouldn’t. Felicia knew that he needed to be in a hospital, but when they drove near one he freaked out. She understood why: There was a deep, family-wide stigma around mental illness.</p>

<p>Quentin was crying, Felicia recalls, “thinking we were going to lose all these people” when the world ended on Monday. He grew inconsolable, then delirious. Finally, on Sunday night, after getting him to shower, Felicia gave him sleeping pills. They fell asleep on the floor, as she was too scared to leave his side.</p>

<p>Felicia is in her early fifties, with a bright, easy laugh and a soft voice that moves quickly between registers. “We wake up Monday morning, he looks around, and I’m like, <em>‘We’re still here!’ ” </em>she singsongs. This was good news, she tried to assure her son, but he wasn’t having it. He went to the bathroom. When he came back, he said, “Mom, don’t be upset with me, but I just killed Will.”</p>

<p>For a second, Felicia didn’t know what to think. Maybe he had.</p>

<p>Will peeked his head into the room and caught her eye. <em>Alive</em>, he mouthed to her.</p>

<p>Then Quentin was moving around, manic. He was determined to jump off the second-story balcony that morning, and he did, several times. “My husband went around the side of the house to try to catch him, and Quentin, like, beat him up.” Felicia’s voice gets quiet. “He punched my husband so hard.” She was finally able to get Quentin to stay in the house. For his own safety, she locked Will out. </p>

<p>Quentin has an uncle who is mentally ill and “in and out of jail,” Felicia says. A cousin is “touched.” Another uncle has a diagnosis of schizophrenia, but he manages. He doesn’t drive; he rides a bicycle. When things get bad for him, and too loud, he “just goes to the woods.” For Felicia, that uncle’s name is a kind of comforting shorthand for: wacky, but OK.  He’d say things that were “off the wall” when Felicia was growing up, things that made the family laugh because they were funny.</p>

<p>But Quentin? He said <em>traumatizing</em> things. “My son is just—he’s a beautiful soul,” Felicia says. “He’s a good human. He’s always just a pleasant…” She starts to cry. “It’s just been such a loss,” she says once, then twice: “It’s been such a loss.”</p>

<p>That day in 2017, with Quentin jumping off the balcony and the world just going on, Felicia realized she had to call the cops to get her son to a hospital. On the phone with law enforcement, she emphasized Quentin’s sweetness, his goodness, and tried to tell his story. It must have helped, because “the two best cops showed up,” Felicia says, her relief still real. They asked the family to stay inside while they talked with Quentin outside. When Felicia rejoined her son, she could tell from the way his arms were moving that he was sure he was flying.</p>

<p>“We talked to Khalil,” one of the cops told Felicia.</p>

<p>“Who’s Khalil?” she asked.</p>

<p>Her son, the cop said. He’d told the officers how his family had moved from Africa.</p>

<p>Recalling this, Felicia laughs. “I’ve never been to Africa,” she says.</p>

<p>Then the ambulance came. As soon as Quentin saw it, he lost it. Felicia was terrified. Her daughters were there with their boyfriends, and somehow they got Quentin to step into the ambulance. But after the doors were shut, he “turned into the Hulk,” Felicia says. He busted the closed doors open and stepped out, naked. Will jumped in front of Quentin, to try to save or stop or catch him, tragically aware of what police have done to other Black men in crisis. But Quentin ran down the street as an officer chased after him. Another followed him in a squad car. “Quentin started beating on the cop car,” Felicia says. He said he was going to kill the officer. But the cop did not retaliate; he remained calm.</p>

<p>Qiana’s boyfriend spoke to Quentin forcefully, in a way he could hear. “Quentin, <em>sit down,</em> <em>sit down,</em>” he said, and Quentin did. Felicia has kind, sloping eyes that are full of emotion. She looks deeply pained when she recalls how Quentin was handcuffed to a gurney. Her son was ill, is ill. He is not a criminal.</p>

<p>Quentin ended up in Peak View, a psychiatric hospital in Colorado Springs, where he stayed for fourteen days. That was in April. In June he was hospitalized again. Because he was 19, a legal adult, it was hard for Felicia to know what kind of care he received, but it often seemed inferior. During one visit to an ER, Quentin was near a small, drunk white girl whom staff were gently encouraging to take a seventy-two-hour hold, Felicia remembers. They treated her as if she was vulnerable and they wanted to keep her safe. Then there was Quentin, six-foot-something, a Black man with a strong build, “gravely ill,” she says with air quotes, and she couldn’t get him that same help because he was seen as a threat.</p>

<p>Quentin’s stepmother is a social worker, and she found a program at Yale for people newly diagnosed with psychosis. Quentin started getting shots of Invega there, a long-acting antipsychotic that’s easier for many patients to stick with than a daily pill. It worked. Initially he’d resisted participating in the program, but he left with a clearer mind. He’d been diagnosed with schizophrenia, he said, and he wanted to learn how to manage it.</p>

<p>“But then his dad decided that he should go back to college,” Felicia says, her peace disturbed. Quentin reenrolled in college, this time in Connecticut. When he and Felicia spoke, he was distraught, then suicidal. “Mom, get me out,” he’d say. The stress was too much.</p>

<p>Before the semester was over, Quentin returned to Colorado. He lived at home, got a job at a convenience store, and went to the doctor for his Invega shots. Felicia didn’t like that he was smoking pot, but at least he was happy, and the pot calmed him down.</p>

<p>“Then I fell apart,” she says.</p>

<h2>Felicia was breaking under the strain. Quentin wouldn’t consent to be hospitalized, or he would consent, only to sign himself out and leave.</h2>

<p><strong>Felicia ran </strong>her own business for medical billing and coding, but caring for a chronically ill family member <em>is</em> a job. “I couldn’t work and take care of him,” she says. She drank to keep from thinking. She became suicidal from exhaustion. “I just needed <em>a minute</em>,” she says. She wound up admitting herself to Cedar Springs, the private psychiatric hospital, in September 2019, and she stayed for twenty-eight days.</p>

<p>Quentin visited his mother every day. He coached and encouraged her. Felicia did equine and group therapy and eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). She got steady and sober and learned new coping skills. Above all: She rested. She was permitted <em>rest</em>.</p>

<p>But her own mother was mad. Why was Felicia telling people her business? Felicia’s mother had once received a bipolar diagnosis, which she thought was bullshit. And anyway, she told Felicia, she already had medicine that worked, and that was E&amp;J brandy.</p>

<p>The next time they talked on the phone, Felicia’s mother said that it must have been Will who made Felicia check into the hospital. Felicia was just back from EMDR and feeling tender. No, she said, I checked myself in. Then she told her mother something she never had before: that a relative had raped her when she was a child, and later she was raped again. In reply her mother said exactly the wrong thing, a mean thing.</p>

<p>When Felicia left Cedar Springs, she kept doing her outpatient work, a rebellion of sorts.</p>

<p>In December 2019, Felicia’s stepfather died, and she and Quentin flew to New Jersey for the funeral. Quentin stayed behind on the East Coast when his mother went home. His father was angry that his son was smoking pot, so Quentin gave that up and started drinking instead. He left the stove on after cooking. He stopped washing and caring for himself. In February, Felicia went to get her son. He was “chimney-smoking,” a pack of cigarettes in no time. He thought that his relatives were cyborgs and that there were terrifying figures in the trees. His family thought it was the drinking. Felicia had to say: This is an illness of the brain. He’s sick.</p>

<p>One day, Quentin’s cousin told Felicia that he was going to drive Quentin, then manic and in psychosis, from Colorado to Connecticut. He thought that a change of scenery would help. They made it to New Jersey, where Quentin’s grandmother called the police for help. He was hospitalized for more than sixty days.</p>

<p>When he returned to Colorado, Felicia started fighting with Diversus, a mental- and behavioral-health provider that treated her son. “They had him on Depakote, all this other stuff,” she says. “I was like, ‘This is not working. It’s making things worse.’ ” Quentin thought Felicia was not his mom and was sure a woman named Lois was. When he looked in the mirror, he saw a blue man. The blue man was terrifying and needed to be destroyed. Quentin cut off the blue man’s eyebrow, his own eyebrow. He cut his forehead trying to get rid of the blue man’s hair. He pulled out the blue man’s teeth. He would turn out the lights to hide.</p>

<p>Quentin hitchhiked. He wandered the streets. One day a nurse found him on the outskirts of Pueblo. Another time a kind man gave him a ride in Colorado Springs and called Felicia afterward. “I just picked up your son,” he said. “I don’t know if he’s well.”</p>

<p>Felicia was breaking under the strain. Quentin wouldn’t consent to be hospitalized, or he would consent, only to sign himself out and leave. Felicia wanted him involuntarily committed but couldn’t persuade anyone to issue an M-1. “I’m sitting in this hospital, with a guy with a missing eyebrow” who was “debating on hurting my husband,” but somehow that was not sufficient.</p>

<p>Desperate, Felicia cold-called an acquaintance to ask for help. “That was a God thing,” Deb Walker says. Deb is a left-leaning nonprofit leader who doesn’t usually speak like that. She says it again, emphatic. “That was a God thing.” Deb thought to call Elisabeth, whom she knew from community work, and Elisabeth picked up.</p>

<p>Quentin would become paranoid if his mother took a phone call, so Elisabeth and Felicia began texting. It was April 28, 2022. Elisabeth and Corey remembered what they’d had to do to get an M-1 hold for Luc less than a year prior. They’d tried and failed to time the “imminent danger” with calls to the police. Corey had taken six weeks off work to help his son. They’d called Luc’s psychiatrist uncle, who recommended that he receive Invega, the long-acting injectable. They were coached by a counselor to not retrieve Luc at the end of the seventy-two-hour hold, so that he could get further treatment. When they followed that advice, they had to foot a $40,000 bill for an extra three days’ stay at the hospital. Then there was the hostility of the behavioral-health worker the night Luc was committed. He was trying to find a reason to not hold Luc, to give him meds and send him on his way—“treat and street” is the shorthand for this problematic cycle. Why should your son get a bed, he asked Corey, when so many people need them? “Because my son is <em>right here</em>,” Corey said.</p>

<p>Bring Quentin in, Elisabeth told Felicia. Bring him in.</p>

<p>Felicia took Quentin to Elisabeth’s clinic. He was in “active psychosis,” Elisabeth recalls. He was pacing around, sure that Will was a cyborg, Felicia was a voodoo priestess, and Elisabeth was going to put him in jail. Elisabeth called 911 to get a transport to the hospital. An older paramedic and his young team showed up. While Elisabeth spoke with the lead, his charges ducked into Quentin’s room, got a pulse-oximeter reading, and took his vitals. “He’s alert and oriented,” one of them said. “He doesn’t qualify for an M-1 hold.”</p>

<p>Elisabeth thought that the EMT’s assessment was bullshit. Anosognosia, or not knowing that you’re sick, is common with profound mental illness, and Quentin had it. The term comes from the Greek: <em>a</em> (without), <em>nosos</em> (disease), <em>gnosis </em>(knowledge). One of the EMTs took out his phone to google whether or not a nurse practitioner can order an M-1 hold. (They can.)</p>

<p>Cops arrived, and by then Quentin was combative. The M-1 hold was placed.</p>

<figure><img src="https://magazine.atavist.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dip_3.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Felicia and Quentin</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>As of this writing,</strong> Quentin has been hospitalized more than twenty times. To get to the hospital where he lived from January 2023 until August 2024, his mother and I take a highway for most of an hour, drive through some exurbs, and arrive in what looks like a little village. From 1887 until 1946, Fort Logan, one of two state-run mental hospitals in Colorado, was an Army base.</p>

<p>Felicia says that the first thing she wants to know about a place is if it’s clean. Fort Logan’s main building, built in the 1960s, is clean and sunlit. Its hallways and greeting areas have an open, airy feel. The floors are covered in small, pretty square tiles; the walls are blond brick. “It’s the total opposite of what I believe a state facility to be,” Felicia says. “In New Jersey, it does not look like that. The odor as soon as you walk in, it’s like, ‘I do <em>not </em>want my family here.’ ”</p>

<p>We walk to a wing behind a locked door to meet Quentin. He is wearing track pants, Nautica slippers, and a loose gray shirt. We sit down at a round table in a common room, not far from a guard. Quentin immediately gives his mother a gift, a stack of socks he bought at the hospital’s gift shop. One pair says: “Best Mom.” Another: “Running late is my cardio.” Felicia laughs. It is clear how much they adore each other, and how relieved they are to be together. Yesterday he and some other patients built gingerbread houses, Quentin says. Today is bingo.</p>

<p>Quentin has a young, handsome face, but his movements are slow, like those of an older man. He’s brought his journal with him, a perfect-bound composition book, as wire spirals aren’t allowed at Fort Logan. He’s crossed out many words and circled others. He shows his mother a list of healthy foods—cucumbers, orange juice, prune juice—beside his fitness goals. On another page he’s drawn a vision board, divided into the categories of work, nutrition, and clothes. He hopes that he and his mom will go to an outlet mall soon, and he has a list of places where he wants to shop: Adidas, North Face, Nike, Ralph Lauren.</p>

<p>Mostly he just wants to moon over Felicia, and she wants to hear about his days. He goes outside for walks, Quentin says. He goes to the gift shop and the vending machine. Patients get kudos points for showering, for relapse-prevention work, for participating in groups. There is music and karaoke.</p>

<p>“Karaoke?” Felicia says, thrilled.</p>

<p>“One time I did ‘Regulators,’ ” Quentin says. “One time Whitney Houston, ‘I Wanna Dance with Somebody.’ ” Another time it was “Ben,” his favorite Michael Jackson song.</p>

<p>“I play pool a little bit too, but I get my tail whipped,” he says, smiling.</p>

<p>“Quentin, I’m proud of you,” Felicia says.</p>

<p>He reads to us from his journal: “My nieces are changing my life.”</p>

<p>“They love you,” his mother says.</p>

<p>“You’re the best mom,” Quentin replies. He high-fives her, and she tears up.</p>

<p>That high-five is hard-earned. When Quentin first came to Fort Logan, the voices in his head were mean. “They were <em>mean</em>,” Felicia says. They told Quentin that he had molested his younger cousins, though he had not. The thought made him scared to go near the girls. The voices also told him that the family dog was a shapeshifter, so then he could not go near the dog. They said <em>nobody likes you</em>, over and over, to this likable, lovable man.</p>

<p>Like Luc and Ben, Quentin has tried many different medications. Felicia says that when he was first admitted to Fort Logan, he was on fifteen different kinds: “Abilify, Latuda, Depakote, lithium.” Haldol, a first-generation antipsychotic, made him too tired to do much of anything.</p>

<p>On her visits, Felicia usually brings a gift of food from the outside world. Today it is a sausage and egg muffin from Burger King and a mini Snickers bar. Quentin’s arms and hands shake while he eats, and it’s clear this worries his mother.</p>

<p>When he gets out of Fort Logan, Quentin wants to work the overnight shift, 8 p.m. to 8 a.m., at Safeway or Walmart. He has a little money saved, and he wants to save more, “to get a vehicle.” He moves his hand along his shirt while he talks and his tattoos become visible, traces of another life, when he was “Mr. Lova Lova,” in Felicia’s words—some gorgeous girl’s boyfriend, a football star with good grades.</p>

<p>She still wonders if something triggered his first psychotic break, LSD perhaps—he tried one of those little squares two or three weeks before he became convinced that the world was ending and that he had killed Will. But Felicia’s brothers think maybe Quentin was always different. When he was little, they called him Cave, short for Captain Caveman, to describe his energy: He wanted to put a fork in a socket, to run fast into a wall.</p>

<p>Quentin goes back to the room where he no longer punches the wall until it cracks and his knuckles bleed, the room he now shares with another patient. He returns with a green folder full of pictures he’s drawn. The lines forming a bear, a shoe, a lion, a shooting star are bright and strong, though the tremor in his hand has made them waver.</p>

<p>The guard tells us the visit is over. We are past time, actually, so we stand to go.</p>

<p>One day, Quentin will be told to go that abruptly. When it happens, and one of the people on the hospital’s waiting list gets his bed, Felicia will receive twenty-four hours’ notice, hardly enough time to pack up his room, let alone plan a new life. “He’s <em>way </em>more resilient than I am,” Felicia says. Still, could he handle working the night shift at Safeway or Walmart while chronically ill?</p>

<p>On the drive back, we pass a group home with gardens and a gracious porch. It makes Felicia happy. She’s grateful for Quentin’s survival, but she wants beauty for him too, wellness, something more. “I want his life to look like what <em>he</em> wants it to look like, and I don’t want to put my fear into it,” she says.</p>

<h2>4.</h2>

<p><strong>I first met Tracy</strong> at Elisabeth’s kitchen table when they were arranging Ben’s memorial. We talked about what poems to read, an order for the service, where to place the heart-shaped rocks, who might speak. Tracy was curled up like a teenager in her chair, and Jen was next to her, giving her the gentlest touches on her legs and hands and feet and head—like strong, light anchors, so that she might not float off forever.</p>

<p>Jen never knew Ben in health, and it had been hard, in their home, to feel like he wasn’t contributing, wasn’t helping. For a while, as a kind of shield, he only wore blue. He ate very quickly. He couldn’t keep track of a conversation. He found it difficult to walk through doorways and had to perform certain rituals to do so. Even as he became more interested in the possibilities of makeup and fashion, he wasn’t able to shower regularly or brush his teeth.</p>

<p>Ben’s weekly therapy was not covered by insurance and cost $150 for thirty minutes. When he was prescribed an antipsychotic that had not yet been issued as a generic, it cost $700 a month. Again insurance would not cover it. His parents got samples. They scrambled. One psychiatrist seemed especially determined and “really gave him a run for his money,” Tracy says. He put Ben on an anti-seizure drug that seemed to help, but he was given so many different medications for so many different diagnoses—Risperdal, Abilify, Luvox, and Lamictal for anxiety, OCD, autism, and borderline personality disorder—that Tracy lost track of what worked when.</p>

<p>There were respites. Tracy describes Ben’s alternative arts high school as “the land of the misfits,” where all kinds of “quirky kids” flourished, and for five good weeks Ben did, too. The administrator at the front desk chose him for an aide. The principal told Ben that if he was having panic attacks, he could weather them in his office. “They were <em>unconditional </em>with him,” Tracy says. “They were like, ‘He’s the most popular kid here!’ ”</p>

<p>Ben loved it. Then he didn’t.</p>

<p>At his favorite coffee shop, he met Nikita, a foreign exchange student from Russia. There was the thrill of his first real boyfriend, the crush and the lust, but also the thrill of <em>the world</em>. Nikita spoke three languages. Ben began to teach himself Russian and German, then Italian, Spanish, French, and Japanese. He wanted the door fluency gave, the entrance and the exit.</p>

<p>College at Western Colorado University repeated what was now a pattern: It was good, and then it wasn’t. By Thanksgiving of 2016, Ben had dropped out and moved back home.</p>

<p>He was hired twice, a triumph, at McDonald’s. He got a job one year at Current, a greeting card factory, during its busy season around the holidays, but would vomit from stress when it was time to go to work, and ended up getting fired. He enrolled at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, then had “a total nervous breakdown,” Tracy says. He was unable to eat or leave his room, and he dropped out after two weeks.</p>

<p>Tracy and Jen and Ben’s dad, Ted, were forever trying one thing and then another. There were small problems to deal with (where was Ben’s passport?) and larger problems, too (who were the older men on his Tinder, and had he been sold for sex?). At one point, after Tracy met Elisabeth, the plan was for Ben and Luc to live together—to save money and become friends—but Luc went to a wilderness treatment center in Utah instead, and Ben got an apartment alone. Tracy remembers visiting Ben’s place. Stunned by what she saw, she took photos. They show kitchen and bathroom sinks that are unusable, filled with clothes and cans of Great Value food, matted papers, open bottles of soap, a glove, a coffee mug, a toy fish. Something is growing on the open toilet lid, and the bowl brims with black liquid and more papers. There are McDonald’s takeout bags in the bed. The stove is caked with dried batter. On the carpeted floor in the bedroom there’s loose toilet paper and a full gallon jug of milk and an upturned colander and a clothing iron and more takeout bags and piles of clothes and cardboard boxes and Fla-Vor-Ice sleeves and some half-eaten food.</p>

<p>He couldn’t do it, Tracy understands now. Couldn’t take care of himself, much less help around the house. <em>Couldn’t. </em>Jen knows this now, too.</p>

<p>Tracy wishes that her child had received permission to just <em>be</em>—from herself and from a culture that confuses productivity with worth. “A good day for him was a day with the cat,” she says. “That’s frowned upon.” Sometimes when he was living at home, he’d ask her to watch a movie with him, and she’d say, “Babe, <em>I’m tired</em>.” Now she realizes, “He was reaching out for help in any way that he could.”</p>

<figure><img src="https://magazine.atavist.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Colorado-Springs-Mothers_Woolf_100-2500x1667.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Tracy holds a note and a box from Ben.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Tracy has a stack</strong> of forty-five bills that double as a travelogue. Thirty-five are unopened when she hands them to me. About half are addressed to Ben, half to Nasim. The return addresses are from Oklahoma City, for medical services in Seattle; Birmingham and South Bend, for charges from Boulder; LaPorte, Indiana; Wethersfield, Connecticut; Troy, Michigan; Oaks, Pennsylvania; Broomfield, Colorado; Coral Springs, Florida; the Woodlands, Texas; Akron, Ohio; Concord, California; Las Vegas, Nevada. The businesses seeking payment include Computer Credit Inc.; One Advantage; Certified Ambulance Group; Virginia Mason Franciscan Health; Radia Inc. P.S.; Dept. 233; Dr. Eric France, Chief Medical Officer, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment; and, repeatedly, American Medical Response.</p>

<p>A bill dated 6/30/21, less than one month from the provision of service, says that the minimum amount due is the full amount: $13,570. A ride in an ambulance, with a “ground mileage” of “Qty: 5,” and one $23.94 injection of Droperidol, an antipsychotic that blocks dopamine receptors, cost $1,238.31. Bay Area Credit Service sent a bill for $18,847.77 for ten ambulance rides. A “urinalysis auto w/ scope” cost $6.97. There are offers for EZ Ways to Pay, including a “New &amp; Improved Online Experience” and a “Live Agent Chat.” You can “Go Green” at MyDocBill.com. One bill asks its recipient to “rate the comfort of the waiting room.”</p>

<p>Ben often moved with an urgency that suggested he was seeking something he never found. He spent six months in Austria, until his parents said, “You have to come home.” Back in the States, he met a girl and they drove to Texas, then crossed the border into Mexico, where Ben ended up in Cancún, “working on a boat or something like that.” He left his passport at a hostel as collateral for an unpaid bill, Tracy says, and lived on the streets until the U.S. Embassy called her. In the five years leading up to March 2022, her child would disappear and reappear. He made it to Vatican City around Easter once. Ted called the police one day when Ben broke into his Salida home through the dog door, looking for food.       </p>

<p>Ben fell in love with a man named Parker, and they lived together in Seattle for six months. Parker became increasingly scared for his partner, whom he knew as Nasim, and broke it off. Ben came home. For a while, he worked at Olive Garden, which he called “the O.G.” “ ‘Minimum wage, minimum effort!’ ” Tracy remembers him saying. “He was always kind of funny in that way.”</p>

<p>In December 2020, their family signed a contract with a case manager, who treated Ben’s challenges as behavioral. “We (family) will no longer support your addiction; we will not tolerate your abusive and aggressive language. As you are an adult now you are responsible for your care and life choices,” the contract reads. Tracy’s greatest fear was that Ben would end up homeless, and then, for a year, he did. He had to be independent, the case manager said, and his family needed to say no. So they did. His grandmother said no when he asked to live with her. Tracy told Max no when he asked if he could put his sibling up in a hotel for the night. It was heartbreaking, and Tracy bitterly regrets it. When she and Jen would pass a person warming themselves on a heating vent on the street, panhandling from a traffic median, or conversing with presences no one else could see, Tracy would say, “That’s somebody’s son.”</p>

<p>So much was lost when Ben lived on the streets, including a great many of the objects that help to tell the story of a life. Tracy has a woman’s coat he wore then, a pair of his shoes, but that’s it. What she has from before are treasures now: sweet notes he wrote as a child, his signature, a green watercolor bird he painted, photographs of his singular face, his blue-gray eyes and steady gaze.</p>

<p>Tracy held her child after giving birth and knew what mothers know:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I heard the stranger &amp; my brain, without looking, vowed</em><br><em>a love-him vow. His struggling, merely, to be.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s from “The Black Maria,” a poem by Aracelis Girmay. And the following language is from Ben’s neuropsychological report, generated after a daylong test meant to measure the full spectrum of a person’s brain functions, which he took after a period of homelessness: The reason for the referral was an “inability to engage in activities of daily living.” Ben had reported having daily panic attacks since the age of 15, along with “perfectionistic” tendencies. He needed to move certain objects from one place to another because they held negativity. He spoke of patenting a wearable EEG technology to predict and prevent panic attacks, of having an “eidetic memory” and the ability to speak twelve languages. He took pain pills, sedatives, hallucinogens. He thought that his mother worked for the FBI. He reported hearing her in the lobby of the testing facility when she was not there. He was troubled by obsessive thoughts between three and eight hours a day.</p>

<p>The report’s author described the patient as suffering from “marked elevations of persecutory beliefs” and “grandiose and bizarre delusions.” The patient had both avolition—a medical inability to engage in goal-directed activities—and anosognosia. Those two terms are in the paragraph where Ben finally received a diagnosis of schizophrenia.</p>

<p>The report was issued late in the fall of 2021. Babe, you need to read your neuropsych report, Tracy would say. If you couldn’t see, you would wear glasses, right? If I had diabetes, I would take diabetes medicine.</p>

<p>But anosognosia, that not-knowing, is one of the reasons profound mental illness is too often fatal. Ben never accepted his diagnosis. The last picture Tracy ever saw of him was a missing person sketch from the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Tracy’s child was</strong> memorialized in a ceremony at a ranch in the violet foothills of Salida. Friends and family showed up in force. Elisabeth couldn’t stop crying. The guests reverenced Ben Nasim Michael’s ashes and placed heart-shaped rocks near them, on a quilt Tracy had made as a gift, one her child never got to use.</p>

<p>“Ben has been out too long in the elements,” the presider said. “Too long in the cold, too long in the dark. We are gathered here in the gentle shadow of the mountains where he found joy and peace, in this warm circle and kind light, to welcome him home.”</p>

<p>There was a strong, clean wind, the sort that whips anything untethered up, and it felt like we all might catch flight.</p>

<p><strong>Elisabeth has never liked </strong>Luc’s cat shirt, the trippy one he used to want to wear all the time. But Tracy is a fan. If he loves it, it’s perfect, she says. She remembers with admiration a family she met through NAMI, and how calm they were about their son’s connection to a particular tree stump. It meant something to him, so he kept the car he lived in near the stump, no big deal.</p>

<p>Tracy returns again and again to social solutions: <em>We</em> all need to change. The mostly well must become more hospitable, radically so, to those among us who have what Susan Sontag calls a “more onerous citizenship.”</p>

<p>Felicia can’t shake the conviction that her son is being spiritually tested, and she wants deliverance for him. Like people in many times and places, she sees how schizophrenia attacks one’s spirit, too. To live well, these days, “I keep busy,” she says, “and I get baptized.”</p>

<p>For Elisabeth, a nurse practitioner, this is a medical problem, in need of medical solutions.</p>

<p>They’re all right, of course.</p>

<p>Elisabeth found the work of Drs. Ann Mandel Laitman and Robert Laitman, who developed a protocol for treating schizophrenia after their son Daniel was diagnosed with it at 15. Schizophrenia is an illness of “gating,” Laitman notes. “Gating is the ability of the individual to be able to focus attention and at the same time tune out extraneous stimuli internal and external,” he writes. “Without gating people are continuously flooded by stimuli.” Those for whom this culminates in a break with reality are predisposed from birth by their genes and have “unquiet minds” in childhood. At some point between in utero and early adulthood, they usually experience a stressor, “trauma, infection, drugs,” that activates their genetic predisposition. The Laitmans recommend choline supplements during pregnancy, fish oil supplements for children in families with a history of serious mental illness, and clozapine as the first-line medication for those suffering from psychosis.</p>

<p>The Laitman Protocol, or EASE as it’s sometimes called, is intense. You begin with 12.5 milligrams of clozapine and build up from there. Because of the side effects of the medication, a patient will also take, as needed, Zofran (for nausea), sublingual atropine drops (for excess saliva), pantoprazole (for acid reflux), beta blockers (for tachycardia and anxiety), desmopressin (for nocturnal incontinence), and Klonopin, if a patient has catatonia that does not respond to the clozapine. Patients following this regimen take Colace (to prevent constipation), metformin (to prevent the dramatic weight gain that accompanies antipsychotics), and, for those with a high risk of seizures, lamotrigine.</p>

<p>When Elisabeth committed to following this protocol with Luc in March 2022, she was very much alone. Clozapine was regulated by an intense risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (or REMS) through the FDA, based on a small set of data from a population of the elderly. That REMS (which the FDA no longer requires) involved weekly blood draws, which made getting a prescription impractical, if not impossible, for most people. After being turned down by two other doctors, Elisabeth found one who knew the protocol and agreed to put Luc on it. Then she called pharmacy after pharmacy until one finally said that it could fill a clozapine prescription. She worked hard to cultivate a relationship with a pharmacist there. She would call every Tuesday, as the drug could only be released one dose at a time. She used a private insurance plan plus Medicaid to cover the costs. One week a different pharmacist refused to fill the prescription; he said it wasn’t safe. Luc’s psychiatrist called. There was a two-day lapse in treatment during which Luc grew increasingly symptomatic and afraid.</p>

<p>Because that’s the thing: This protocol works for Luc. He is well more days than not, and so lovely. At his twenty-first birthday party, to celebrate how far he’d come, his Mamaw smoked a cigar.</p>

<p>If asked, Elisabeth says, “My son is disabled”—language that gives grace for a different life, a slower life, which is not to say a lesser life. Luc has kept his sobriety, a triumph of three years now. He moved into a tiny home that feels large, next door to his parents, where he is a loving caregiver to his cat. One Friday last fall, at his favorite kava bar, he displayed some of his photographs for the first time. He works a few hours every week as an assistant at his uncle’s office downtown, and to do so he gets nicely dressed. Sometimes he takes an e-scooter there, and sometimes he gets a ride. I walk with him on a one-mile route that he favors, and he is kind and funny company. He still calls his mother many times a day when she’s at work. Evenings are out for socializing, as are large crowds, and change is unwelcome, but in what matters most—love—Luc is rich. We’re scheming on finding him a girlfriend, and she will be lucky indeed.</p>

<p>Still, sometimes Elisabeth gets terrified. At night she’ll go downstairs to check on her younger son while he’s sleeping, and she’ll call Luc to make sure he’s alive and OK.</p>

<p><strong>“I think Tracy’s</strong> in a special hell of isolation,” Elisabeth says. “Yeah,” Tracy immediately agrees. “I think that’s right.” We’re at a park together, walking.</p>

<p>What Elisabeth means is that other parents can’t go near their worst fear—the loss of a child—even within the community of people affected by serious mental illness, so Tracy feels like a burden to them with her grief. In the summer, it helps to garden. In the winter, in the evening, she likes to walk and walk, just looking at the Christmas lights. She tries to be there for Felicia and Elisabeth—at NAMI events, at fundraisers—but sometimes it’s too hard. When that happens, they carry her story with them.</p>

<p>Tracy had never heard of a neuropsych report until her child got one. Now, as a probation officer for juvenile offenders, she orders more of them than anyone on her team. “I don’t wait,” she says. She’s determined to get the help for other families that hers never received.</p>

<p>It was good for her and Jen to go together to the place where Ben died, such a pretty place, in a pretty neighborhood. They found a fuzzy brown caterpillar, its coat the color of Ben’s favorite waffle shirt. Climbing up the steep banks of the creek, they both slipped and fell, and the tree that caught and held Ben’s body in the water’s cold current caught and held them, too. That was a gift.</p>

<p>But so much still hurts. Tracy’s child’s ashes were sent through the mail: That hurts. She tries and fails and tries again to forgive the tough-love caseworker, to forgive herself. She still sends messages to the number Ben last used to text her: <em>I miss you. I love you. Where are you?</em> Now she and Jen are among the primary caregivers for Tracy’s niece, who was otherwise headed to a foster home. Ben’s old bedroom is this glad little girl’s, and after so much suffering, her joy is a balm. At the same time, Tracy says, “It’s like, when do I get to rest?”</p>

<p>Sometimes everything feels possible for Felicia. “I’ve worked really hard to be able to speak at these tables,” she says, and there are many. She was on her city’s Law Enforcement Transparency and Advisory Commission; she was awarded a mayor’s fellowship and a governor’s fellowship; she’s the secretary of the local Black Chamber of Commerce. When she met Elisabeth, she felt like God was saying, “This is your partner—you’re gonna do some things.” And they have. They went to the state capitol in the spring of 2025, with a group called Colorado Mad Moms, and held up poster-size photos of their sons printed with the words, “Severe mental illness is not a crime.” They are working to get some of the legal language around M-1 holds changed: what “gravely disabled” means, what “psychiatric deterioration” means. But then another week, the car breaks down; Felicia’s dog dies; she misses her mother, who passed away in 2022 and “could throw down in the kitchen like no one else.”</p>

<p>On a rough night last fall, she asked Will to take the keys so she couldn’t go get a drink. “My issue is I start to extra, extra, extra rely on the bottle,” Felicia says. Because here she is, trying to hold up her adult son, who has to stick to the Weather Channel after the TV started talking to him while he was watching <em>Rocky</em>—a breakthrough symptom. At home she needs to care for her autistic stepson, get him “pancakes every Saturday”; her husband, a veteran, sometimes leaps out of bed when the night terrors from his PTSD get bad; and, not long ago, one of her sweet grandbabies said things that made Felicia worry about schizophrenia all over again. Then there’s work, and the whole country, and who wouldn’t want something to take the edge off all that?</p>

<h2>Jen had a nightmare, Tracy says: She had headphones on, they were loud, and she couldn’t take them off. The dream was about Ben’s illness—Jen was feeling what he felt.</h2>

<p>Quentin has been at an assisted-living facility in Colorado Springs ever since he lost his bed at Fort Logan in August 2024. It feels like a certain sort of old folks’ home: quiet, dark, and carpeted, with lots of TVs on low. Felicia goes to see him often. When Quentin said that the sun god comes around and bothers him when he puts his Pumas on, his mom’s advice was sound. “Don’t put the Pumas on,” she instructed. “Put the church shoes on!”</p>

<p>Elisabeth went with Felicia to a recent meeting with the facility manager, who was trying to push Quentin out. He needs skilled nursing, the manager said, because he is sometimes incontinent, and the facility can’t do all that laundry, even though doing laundry is one of its advertised services. The manager said this in front of Quentin, which to Felicia felt shaming. It’s the meds, Elisabeth told her. If Quentin’s meds were managed correctly, this would not be happening. Elisabeth offered to find a nurse who would do that. The manager said no.</p>

<p>At least Quentin has a doctor Felicia trusts. “He listens,” she says. “He makes time.” Dr. Ash has been trying to sort out Quentin’s many and complicated medications to find out what’s working, what’s not. Felicia and Elisabeth learned that the assisted-living facility uses qualified medication administration personnel, or QMAPs, to give residents their meds. Instead of adjusting the dose when a change was prescribed, the QMAPs were just adding the old dose to the new one. Ten milligrams of Abilify after fifteen, for instance, when the order was to increase a dose from ten to fifteen. That explained the incontinence, Elisabeth says, and why Quentin was telling Felicia that there was a spaceship at his window.</p>

<p>Who would do that with someone’s meds for cancer? Or cystic fibrosis? You could die from that, Elisabeth says.</p>

<p>Lately, Quentin’s uncle has blocked phone calls from him. He loves his nephew, but he doesn’t want to have another conversation in which Quentin claims he hurt his cousins. Even Dr. Ash has pushed Quentin on that, asking “What’s the evidence?” for such a thing. Felicia loves that.</p>

<p>Healing comes, goes. Jen had a nightmare, Tracy says: She had headphones on, they were loud, and she couldn’t take them off. The dream was about Ben’s illness—Jen was feeling what he felt. To her clients dealing with addiction, Tracy now asks: What does it do for you? She wants to get to the root of their behaviors. </p>

<p>Elisabeth keeps taking more patients who suffer from psychosis into her practice. “I’m very comfortable with them,” she says. She recently won an award for her advocacy, after Felicia nominated her. “She makes the system move fast,” the presenter said of Elisabeth. “She conveys concern and compassion. She sees the person, not the illness.”</p>

<p>Felicia’s heart is broken right open by the story of a woman in her support group whose son is in prison, and by Rob and Michele Reiner’s deaths, and by their son, who must be so unwell. Her burdens get lighter around her granddaughters. She has kept some precious gifts from her own great-grandmother, totems of the fiercest and least complicated love she’s ever known, love like a shield, like shade. Sometimes she goes and sits near them, quietly, to remember. One day at dinner, Felicia tells me, Tracy, and Elisabeth that she’s thinking of running for office, and we all say: <em>Do</em>.</p>

<p>Early in all this, Felicia says, God gave her a vision. Quentin is standing in a tuxedo on a long red carpet, well and so handsome, before a gathered crowd. This is the word she got then: “People are gonna listen.”</p>

		</span>andra “Pepa” Denton had just removed her shoes and settled into the massage chair at the She Thing salon in Queens for what she hoped would be a relaxing pedicure when her cellphone started to buzz. Glancing down at the screen, she saw that it was a call from her musical partner, the person with whom she reclaimed hip-hop for women, scored international hits with songs like “Push It,” “Shoop,” and “Whatta Man,” and toured the world: Cheryl “Salt” James.</p>



<p>
	She answered with a friendly greeting, having no idea she was about to get some devastating news. </p>



<p>
	“She said, ‘I don’t want to be attached to your hips anymore,’” Denton recalls to <em>Rolling Stone</em>, still dumbfounded all these years later. “I was like, ‘What does that mean?’ And she said, ‘I don’t want to do this anymore.’”</p>



<p>
	And with that brief phone call, sometime in 2000, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/salt-n-pepa/">Salt-N-Pepa</a>, one of the most influential groups in hip-hop history, were no more.</p>



<p>
	In hindsight, the split wasn’t hard to see coming. A few years earlier, in a 1997 <em>Rolling Stone</em> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/salt-n-pepa-do-it-their-way-101797/">cover story</a>, James made it clear that she was no longer interested in recording typical Salt-N-Pepa material. “I don’t want to do any more ‘Shoops.’ I told Pep that if you can respect me just wanting to do inspirational and original music, then I would do another album,” she said.

<p>
	With those terms agreed upon, Salt-N-Pepa released their 1997 album, <em>Brand New</em>. It didn’t go well. Lead single “R U Ready” bombed, and after peaking at Number 37, the album dropped off the charts. “There was no promotion, no money put behind it, nothing,” James tells <em>Rolling Stone</em>. “It was like the worst drop-the-ball on a Salt-N-Pepa album possible.”</p>



<p>
	When it came time to tour, the group, accustomed to arenas and big rooms, was back in clubs for the first time since their early days. “Cheryl couldn’t handle it,” Denton says. “It shook her because that album was her baby, it was hers. Mentally, I saw something just leave in that moment. And it really put a damper on us, our relationship.”

	Neither woman, not to mention Salt-N-Pepa’s often overlooked DJ, Deidra “Spinderella” Roper, thought the group would ever recover. There were just too many fires still smoldering, too many conflicts left unresolved, from bad business deals to the seemingly simple question of if Salt-N-Pepa are a duo or a trio (turns out, it depends on who you ask).

	But more than 20 years later, on the evening of Nov. 8, 2025, all three women once again found themselves on the same stage, for the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Los Angeles. After decades of being ignored by the Hall of Fame — despite their massive influence, a string of era-defining hits, and even a pop-culture meme thanks to Patrick Stewart’s dramatic <em>Saturday Night Live</em> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGIvlK8OyQa/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">introduction</a> of the group — Salt-N-Pepa were finally entering the hallowed institution.</p>



<p>
	“When they came up in the game, female rappers had to step up to the mic and show that they could go toe to toe with the guys,” Missy Elliott told the crowd during her speech inducting the group. “Salt-N-Pepa and Spinderella did it effortlessly, seamlessly.… These three women are the bricklayers to the foundation that holds hip-hop together.”</p>

<p>
	Despite the seemingly united front at the Hall of Fame, however, drama simmered in the group. A sizable portion of it was due to the band’s protracted legal battle with Universal Records over ownership of their masters, which resulted in the removal of much of their catalog from streaming services. To this day, some of Salt-N-Pepa’s most indelible hits, like “Let’s Talk About Sex” and the original recording of “Push It,” are unavailable to stream.

<p>
	When it came time to give their speeches, James spoke frankly about the issues facing the group: “We are in a fight right now for our masters. After 40 years, as we celebrate this, kids can’t even stream our music. It’s been taken off all streaming platforms because the industry still doesn’t want to play fair.” As the house filled with cries of support, James leaned into the mic and said, “Salt-N-Pepa has never been afraid of a fight.”</p>



<p>
	A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE ROCK &amp; ROLL HALL OF FAME ceremony, a much more relaxed James is chilling by a new swimming pool at her home in L.A. It’s an incredibly busy time as she preps for the induction and communicates with her legal team, but she’s taking some time to look back at the journey that brought her to the Hall of Fame. It started in the very early Eighties, when James and Denton were still attending grade school in New York City, years before they actually met.</p>



<p>
	“I lived across the street from Bushwick High School in Brooklyn,” she says. “I’d watch the B-Boys throw their cardboard down [to breakdance] near a DJ with an MC on the mic. I just remember being enamored, fascinated, hooked. You couldn’t keep me out of a park jam. My mom used to come get me out of the park. The DJ used to say, ‘Cheryl James, your mom is here.'”

<p>
	Meanwhile, about 10 miles away in Jamaica, Queens, a teenage Denton was having very similar experiences. “I remember people setting up these turntables in the park and hooking them up to the electricity from the streetlights,” she says. “It was the most amazing thing I’d ever seen, people rapping to these old-school beats.”</p>



<p>
	It was the birth of one of the most important musical movements of the 20th century, and it happened to take place practically in their backyards. But even though James and Denton found it intoxicating, their similarities largely stopped there. The Jamaican-born Denton was an extreme extrovert who lived to party with her friends, while James was a quiet introvert without any hint of a wild streak. Anyone who met them back then wouldn’t have imagined them spending even a few minutes together, let alone forming a lifelong bond.</p>



<p>
	But fate placed them in the lunchroom of Queensborough Community College in 1985. “Cheryl stood out to me because she was quiet,” says Denton. “Everyone was like, ‘Sandy! Sandy!’ And here was this quiet girl in the corner, not calling me, not saying anything. I remember one day I asked her to play [the card game] spades. She said, ‘No.’ I was like, <em>‘Ooohkay</em>.'”</p>



<p>
	James was working as a telephone solicitor at Sears Roebuck to pay her tuition. For every Sears application she got someone to submit, she received one dollar. “Instead of being in class, I was walking around the lunchroom asking people if they wanted to fill out these applications,” she says. “Pep saw me coming with the papers, and she was like, ‘I need a job.’ I said, ‘Come to Sears. They’ll hire anybody.’ And they did.”</p>



<p>
	Denton still marvels at the memory. “It’s very spiritual,” she says. “I know God’s hand was on it. She didn’t hand out those forms to everyone.”</p>



<p>
	They picked cubicles at the Sears call center right next to each other and formed an unlikely friendship. “I would live vicariously through Pep,” says James. “She had the wildest stories.”</p>



<p>
	Also working in the cubicle rows at Sears was a budding comedian named Martin Lawrence and an aspiring music producer named Hurby “Luv Bug” Azor, who dated James. Christopher Reid and Christopher Martin, two ambitious rappers who’d become Kid ‘N Play, had jobs there too, making the call center a wellspring for some of the most commercial hip-hop of the era. But at the moment, everyone was just trying to keep their sales jobs.</p>

<div><iframe title="Salt-N-Pepa - Push It (Official Music Video)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vCadcBR95oU?feature=oembed"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>
	James, however, hadn’t thought of a career in music or show business; she was intent on becoming a nurse. But Azor encouraged her to get behind the mic. Impressed by what he saw, he set out to create a rap duo that he could manage and produce, a sort of female Run-D.M.C.

			</div>

<p>
	Two acquaintances of James, one girl with a squeaky voice, another deemed too proper, didn’t work out. Then Pepa got on the mic. “Our voices just were magic together,” James says. “We were meant to make music.”</p>



<p>
	Doug E. Fresh and Slick Rick’s braggadocios “The Show” had just come out, and Azor wrote a diss track in response called “The Showstopper,” which Denton and James recorded in Azor’s basement utilizing just a mic, turntables, and a tape recorder. He called his new rap duo “Super Nature.”</p>



<p>
	It all seemed little more than a lark until one day Denton took James for a ride in her Datsun 210 and “The Showstopper” came on the radio. “We were like, ‘Is this real?'” Denton recalls. “I couldn’t do nothing but slam the brakes, throw the car in park, and jump out. Cheryl was screaming, ‘Get in the car!’ But I jumped out, screaming on the boulevard, ‘That’s me on the radio!’”</p>



<p>
	To capitalize on the buzz, Azor changed the group’s name to Salt-N-Pepa from a line in “The Showstopper” (“I’m gonna show you how it’s supposed to be/Cuz we the Salt and Pepa MCs”), started booking local shows — where Lawrence often kicked off the evening with a comedy set — and made arrangements for the group to record its debut LP, <em>Hot, Cool &amp; Vicious</em>.</p>

<p>
	They cut the album at a makeshift studio in a Brooklyn brownstone owned by Fresh Gordon of the Choice MC’s. Azor wrote and produced most of the songs, but it was Gordon who came up with an infectious synth part that became the basis for Salt-N-Pepa’s breakthrough song, “Push It.” At first, they thought it was too poppy and played into the chief criticism of the group at the time.</p>



<p>
	“People thought we were pop because we were popular,” Denton says, “and crossover wasn’t really a thing back then.” But Azor brushed aside their concerns and pushed them into a bathroom to record their vocals.</p>



<p>
	The song was originally the B side to their single “Tramp,” but DJs were drawn to “Push It.” It took time and a lot of touring, with Salt-N-Pepa sharing bills with artists like DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, but “Push It” crawled up the Hot 100. In February 1988, it landed at Number 19, not far from Fleetwood Mac’s “Everywhere,” INXS’ “Need You Tonight,” and Bruce Springsteen’s “Tunnel of Love.”</p>



<p>
	Salt-N-Pepa were now part of the pop mainstream, but early hip-hop acts like Sugarhill Gang, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, and the Fat Boys all had brief moments near the top of the pop charts too before imploding. To many in the industry, hip-hop was still a passing fad, and labels devoted far more resources to white acts.

<p>
	But Salt-N-Pepa kept their momentum going with 1988’s <em>A Salt With a Deadly Pepa</em> — which spawned the hit “Shake Your Thang” — and hit another gear in 1990 with <em>Blacks’ Magic</em> and the smash “Let’s Talk About Sex.” “That song caused a lot of controversy and got a lot of parents upset,” says James. “This man said to us one time, ‘I was really down with you girls, but basically now you’re making this smutty music.’ And I’m like, ‘Did you listen to the song?’ We weren’t promoting. We were saying we wanted to talk about it.”</p>



<p>
	They felt vindicated when ABC News anchor Peter Jennings heard the song and invited them to rerecord it as “Let’s Talk About AIDS” as part of an AIDS awareness campaign. “A lot of organizations embraced us because we were brave enough to talk about something, HIV, that nobody wanted to talk about,” James says.</p>



<p>
	In 1993, when many rap act of the Eighties were being cast aside by the harder sounds of Dr. Dre’s <em>The Chronic</em> and gangsta rap, Salt-N-Pepa sold 5 million copies of their fourth album, <em>Very Necessary</em>, on the strength of hits like “Shoop,” “None of Your Business,” and the collaboration with En Vogue, “Whatta Man.”</p>

<p>
	The success placed them onstage at the MTV Video Music Awards alongside the Rolling Stones and Springsteen, won them their first Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, and took them on tour all across the planet. “We went to Japan, Russia, and performed for kings and the even the Sultan of Brunei,” says Denton. “We went to places most rappers don’t even know about.”</p>



<p>
	They also generated millions of dollars — but much of it didn’t go to them. The group chalks it up to bad deals it had signed and Azor’s role as manager, producer, and primary songwriter. “When you’re young and you’re an artist, especially in this genre of music, you get taken advantage of left and right,” says James. “You want to create, you want to make music, and you don’t want to deal with business, which is a huge downfall for most artists … But we were in all these obscure European cities, and we’re platinum here and we’re gold there, and they’re giving us plaques and they’re having big dinners.”</p>



<p>
	At one such party, they were presented with individual Cartier watches. “It was a $12,000 watch,” James says. “I was like, ‘Holy cow, we must really be making them some good money.’ But I’m still living at my mother’s house.”</p>



<p>
	Complicating matters was Salt’s relationship with Azor. “Before all of this started, Hurby was just a regular guy, I was a regular girl, and we were in puppy love,” James says. “But now he’s a big deal, I’m an artist under his production company, and all these other ladies started showing up. It’s the old story that a lot of women in music go through. I don’t recommend anyone dating their producer or their manager, ever.”

<p>
	Making the situation even worse, Denton and Azor had their own issues. “She almost beat him up in a van one time,” says James. “I had to stop her. I was like, ‘Listen, once you beat my boyfriend up, where do we go from there?’”</p>



<p>
	Denton sighs when all this comes up. “It’s not good for a group when someone is involved with the manager, the owner,” she says. “It means that somebody’s going to be left out. And sometimes it’s not fair to the other member because they get caught in the crossfire. I tried to tell her that staying involved with Hurby wasn’t a good idea. And her words were like, ‘Don’t tell me who I can date and who I cannot date.'”</p>

<p>
	James eventually realized she was in an unhealthy relationship and split from Azor while maintaining business and creative ties. Later, she decided to make a complete break following the <em>Very Necessary</em> tour, sparking a costly legal battle with Azor (they eventually settled with their former manager). When the dust settled, several years had passed, and the group signed with a new label, London Records.</p>



<p>
	The vision was a fresh start for Salt-N-Pepa where they’d finally control their creative destiny. They titled the album <em>Brand New,</em> but its disappointing performance, among other issues, led to that earth-shattering phone call from James to Denton at the salon.</p>



<p>
	SALT-N-PEPA’S SPLIT WAS DEVASTATING FOR DENTON, but it also had a huge impact on a third member of the group who has spent the past 40 years straddling a very blurry and uncomfortable line between hired hand and full member: Deidra “Spinderella” Roper. Telling her story requires us to rewind the clock back to the earliest days of the group when Azor brought in another DJ, Latoya Hanson, to serve as the original Spinderella. Hanson stuck around long enough to appear on the cover of the first album but left before it took off. “We weren’t vibing for the most part, but she also got married and she said she didn’t want to do it anymore,” says James. “I don’t know what story she’s telling, but she basically quit.” </p>



<p>
	Hanson has lived a quiet life over the years, but she did vent some old frustrations to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/08/27/latoya-hanson-salt-n-pepa-rock-hall-original-spinderella/">TMZ</a> in August 2025 when Salt-N-Pepa were inducted into the Hall of Fame and she was excluded. “What caused the split was a lot of internal, personal, female, catty jealously,” she said. “It’s the same thing as the Supremes … And Spinderella is my name. They took my name. Hurby may have given that name to Deidra, but he took it from me.”

<p>
	Whatever the truth, Hurby was looking for a new DJ in 1987. Word got back to Roper, still in high school at the time. “I had picked up some techniques from my boyfriend,” she says. “He taught me backspinning, he taught me the breaks on the records. And I so phoned up Hurby and was like, ‘Wait a minute. Salt-N-Pepa? The one that be on the radio, Salt-N-Pepa?'”</p>



<p>
	Denton joined just in time to be in the “Push It” video, enraging her predecessor. “I was hot [when I first saw it],” Hanson told TMZ. “I already knew it was coming, but I was hot. I was on fire.”</p>



<p>
	Roper, meanwhile, felt ostracized by her bandmates. “There was a lot of distance between us at first because I’m younger,” she says. “They would sit together, and they’d be laughing and kicking, and I would be by myself. I made friends with everybody else on the bus until they eventually warmed up to me.”</p>

<p>
	When Roper saw the tensions flare up with Azor, she kept her head down. “I minded my business,” she says. “My responsibility was to take care of what I’m supposed to take care of. Deal with this music, drop my cues, do these shows, be on time. I noticed the internal turmoil, but in the beginning I was just bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, trying to figure it all out.”</p>



<p>
	The group rewarded her loyalty by featuring her on every album cover after she joined, posing with her on the cover of <em>Rolling Stone</em>, and presenting themselves as a trio most everywhere they went in public. “We didn’t want to be like other artists who didn’t highlight their DJ,” says James. “And so we made a conscious choice to bring her from behind the turntables, put her in the front, even give her a verse on a song or two, and really celebrate her. It gave the appearance of an equal trio because of the way we presented it.”</p>



<p>
	Often, it was just that, an “appearance.” “Pep and I were friends, and we were partners for years before she came in,” says James of Roper. “We had a whole career and another DJ. In me and Pep’s mind, the partnership had always been Salt-N-Pepa, but I get that some people felt like it was a trio.”</p>



<p>
	At least in the public eye, things were harmonious within Salt-N-Pepa — but then Salt disbanded the group. At that point, all three women had to find their own way after years as a unit. Roper began hosting a radio show in L.A., James focused on her young family and solo music, and Denton did whatever she could to keep her name out there, including a role on VH1’s <em>Surreal Life</em> where she shared a house with Jose Canseco and Omarosa Manigault. She also did a stint on <em>The Surreal Life: The Fame Games</em>, where she made it nearly to the end of the competition but was outmaneuvered by disgraced porn star Ron Jeremy and <em>Baywatch </em>actress Traci Bingham. “The only thing I regret is getting into other businesses I have no business being in,” she says with a laugh, “like real estate.” (She also wrote a memoir, <em>Let’s Talk About Pep</em>, where she detailed past relationships and her difficult marriage to Naughty By Nature rapper Antony “Treach” Criss.)

<p>
	The only thing Denton didn’t consider was making solo music. “To this day, I have never made a song without Salt besides one guest spot on a Missy Elliott album,” she says. “If it ain’t Salt-N-Pepa, it ain’t nothing for me.”</p>

<p>
	After about five years of inactivity, James started to feel differently about working with Denton again, especially after they were approached by VH1 about starring in a reality show where they could air out their differences. “We worked through some of our issues and even went through therapy together,” James says. “It was very emotional.”</p>



<p>
	The show also gave Roper a chance to finally explain why she viewed herself as unequal. “’Do you consider me the ‘N’ in Salt-N-Pepa?'” she asked her group mates during a tense sit-down caught on camera. They both told her they did not. “I always see you as icing on the cake,” James responded. “Me and Sandy can still do a show, even if you don’t show up.”</p>



<p>
	The women agreed to disagree but soldiered on as a trio for a few years, headlining throwback tours like I Love the 90s, where they shared the stage with Coolio and Vanilla Ice. But in 2019, when Salt-N-Pepa agreed to an arena package tour with New Kids on the Block, En Vogue, and Rick Astley, Spinderella wasn’t invited. All signs point to a dispute over money.</p>



<p>
	“Despite my participation in promoting the tour and being highly publicized as one of the acts, in January 2019 I received a ‘termination’ email,” Roper wrote to fans on Instagram. “I refuse to participate in misleading fans, ticketholders, and others who — based on all the advertising — were anticipating seeing the iconic #SaltnPepa and #Spinderella trio.”</p>



<p>
	Later that year, Roper sued them over unpaid royalties, trademark infringement, fraud, and breach of contract. A judge threw out the case and sent them into mediation. “Spin and her legal team adopted a scorched earth approach that brought unnecessary attention to a business dispute,” James and Denton said in a group statement, “that all along could have, and should have, been settled amicably and privately.” </p>



<p>
	It was the kind of nasty public battle that could have caused a permanent schism. And for a few years that seemed like the outcome as Salt-N-Pepa continued to perform only as a duo. But in October 2024, Pepa appeared onstage at Spinderella’s Halloween Boo Bash and ran through “Push It,” “Shoop,” and “Whatta Man.”

<p>
	“A lot of people play divide-and-conquer in this business, and they get in people’s heads and stop them from talking,” says Denton. “I finally got a chance to say, ‘Let me talk to Spin.’ I knew people was in her head. I wanted to say, ‘They lied to you and made you believe that you were getting this when we weren’t getting that.’ But it took me three and a half years to get Spin to say ‘I love you’ back to me. But she said, ‘I do, Pep. I really do.'”</p>



<p>
	For James, her healing started when she too decided to show up unannounced at one of Spinderella’s solo events in L.A. “She apologized for her part and any hurt that I felt,” Roper says. “I was like, ‘We’re not kids anymore. Too much time has passed to be in involved with each other to allow all the noise that’s out there come in.’”</p>



<p>
	Adds James: “We’ve had some difficult conversations one-on-one, her and I, and we are in a way better space.”</p>



<p>
	Salt-N-Pepa have made several appearances as a trio recently, and everyone says they’re ready to put the turmoil behind them. “It’s giving me chills now because it was such a fight, and it was unnecessary,” says Roper. “I never want to fight with who I call my sisters.”</p>



<p>
	Much of this played out in private, but the public knew the broad strokes thanks to legal filings and press coverage. What few people knew is that before the trio finally made peace, the duo of James and Denton fractured one more time. “Salt quit me again,” says Denton with a laugh. “She called in August 2023 and once again said, ‘I don’t want to do this anymore, I’m tired.’ I sat there and thought, ‘Why shouldn’t I be able to perform songs that I wrote and produced?'”</p>



<p>
	Despite being uncertain if fans would accept Pepa on her own, Denton told her agent at CAA to look for promoters willing to book her. To her surprise, there was interest. “It was so empowering,” she says. “The audience didn’t question me. They didn’t go, ‘Where’s Salt?’ The way people received me was just magical.”</p>



<p>
	After about two years of singing “Shoop” and “Push It” alone for the first time in her life, word came back to Denton that James was ready to return to the fold. “I just wanted to stop traveling,” James explains. “I needed a break.”</p>

<p>
	The timing was fortuitous. The group members soon learned that they were making it into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. It also allowed them to stand united as they battled Universal over ownership of their master recordings. “The law gives us the right when 35 years has passed to get the music copyrights back that we created,” says Denton, “and end the original contracts that we signed at the very beginning of our careers when we had no bargaining power.”

<p>
	A judge recently ruled against them, and they’re planning an appeal. But even if they don’t win, they hope the effort inspires other artists to fight for their rights. “Just because we ran into a little hiccup, that doesn’t mean we still don’t want to enlighten and encourage other artists to look at your paperwork, see where you at 35 years in the game,” Denton says. “They think we shouldn’t talk about it anymore, and they’re just going to shut us down. Yeah, you can shut us down in the courts, but you can’t shut our mouths down.”</p>



<p>
	These days, Salt-N-Pepa and Spinderella seem to enjoy standing on steady ground. They’re looking ahead to a busy slate of shows in 2026 and beyond, and, according to James, there’s a possibility they’ll open for Janet Jackson.</p>



<p>
	“We’re very open to doing shows with Janet,” Denton adds. “And there’s been talk of shows with TLC, which would be great because people always pitted us against each other, because we were one three-female group and they were the next one.”</p>



<p>
	Does that mean James and Denton now definitely see the group as a trio? “We’re a duo/trio,” James shoots back. “That’s what we need to start saying in our bio.”</p>



<p>
	After all these years, Roper says she’s at peace with that. “Maybe we can make hats that say ‘duo’ and ‘trio,'” she says with a laugh. “We can look at them and go, ‘What is it today? Oh, it’s a trio.’”</p>



<p>
	There’s even discussions about a new album, their first since the <em>Brand New</em> debacle nearly 30 years ago. This time around, they’re willing to let Hurby play a role in it too. Despite everything that happened in the Nineties, they’ve patched up their relationship and Hurby even appeared with them at the Hall of Fame. “Listen, never say never,” says James. “A new album would be a great way to wrap up a great career, put a pink bow on it.”

	James also has a new solo song called “Chosen” that she’s eager to share with fans. “‘Chosen’ is a celebration of the Chosen Ones, the ones that were there in the beginning that laid the foundation and the groundwork for hip-hop,” she says. “Gen Z and Gen X are starving for some grown-folks hip-hop.”</p>
