The deal itself was a laughingstock. No move of its kind in NBA history has been so obviously misguided, so clearly without even the most basic defense. It stacked terrible judgment on poor basketball philosophy and inexplicable process. And Davis, through no real fault of his own, came to represent it all. His tenure with the Dallas Mavericks was cursed from the start. Once the trade failed—and it could only fail—that disaster was always bound to compound in <em>another</em> move for even less value. Harrison didn’t even keep his job long enough to see those failures through, but the Mavericks trudged toward them all the same before finally accepting the inevitable.</p><p>Dallas traded Davis to the Washington Wizards in the lead-up to Thursday’s trade deadline and did it without getting back a single star, blue-chip prospect, or highly coveted draft pick in return. The deal was an acknowledgment of a franchise-crippling blunder that never should have happened in the first place. It was also one more indignity, seeing as the Mavs—in the updated accounting—effectively sold out Doncic for Max Christie, an expiring Khris Middleton, two long-shot prospects<span>,</span> one Marvin Bagley, three not very good first-round picks, and three seconds. </p><div><article><a href="/podcasts/the-bill-simmons-podcast/2026/02/05/bill-simmons-zach-lowe-live-nba-trade-deadline-reaction-anthony-davis-james-harden"><div><div><img alt="" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2026%2F02%2F2-4_BS_Pod_Thumb_No_Text.jpg&amp;w=256&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=a8b73fcf73f629560bb508a5483df024a46b0236"></div></div></a><div><a href="/podcasts/the-bill-simmons-podcast/2026/02/05/bill-simmons-zach-lowe-live-nba-trade-deadline-reaction-anthony-davis-james-harden"><p>NBA Trade Deadline Reactions and Super Bowl Picks With Zach Lowe and Joe House</p><div><div>NBA Trade Deadline Reactions and Super Bowl Picks With Zach Lowe and Joe House</div><div>NBA Trade Deadline Reactions and Super Bowl Picks</div><div>NBA Trade Deadline Reactions and SB Picks</div></div></a><div><div><svg><path></path></svg></div><div><svg><path></path></svg></div><div><div><a href="/podcasts/the-bill-simmons-podcast"><div>The Bill Simmons Podcast</div><div><div>The Bill Simmons Podcast</div></div></a><span> • Feb. 5</span><span> • 2 hr 3 min</span></div></div></div></div><div><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3fr6c92ENQE96rvTfUOGTZ"><svg><path></path></svg></a></div></article><article><a href="/podcasts/the-bill-simmons-podcast/2026/02/05/bill-simmons-zach-lowe-live-nba-trade-deadline-reaction-anthony-davis-james-harden"><div><div><img alt="" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2026%2F02%2F2-4_BS_Pod_Thumb_No_Text.jpg&amp;w=256&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=a8b73fcf73f629560bb508a5483df024a46b0236"></div></div></a><div><a href="/podcasts/the-bill-simmons-podcast/2026/02/05/bill-simmons-zach-lowe-live-nba-trade-deadline-reaction-anthony-davis-james-harden"><p>NBA Trade Deadline Reactions and Super Bowl Picks With Zach Lowe and Joe House</p><div><div>NBA Trade Deadline Reactions and Super Bowl Picks With Zach Lowe and Joe House</div><div>NBA Trade Deadline Reactions and Super Bowl Picks</div><div>NBA Trade Deadline Reactions and SB Picks</div></div></a><div><div><svg><path></path></svg></div><div><svg><path></path></svg></div><div><div><a href="/podcasts/the-bill-simmons-podcast"><div>The Bill Simmons Podcast</div><div><div>The Bill Simmons Podcast</div></div></a><span> • Feb. 5</span><span> • 2 hr 3 min</span></div></div></div></div><div><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3fr6c92ENQE96rvTfUOGTZ"><svg><path></path></svg></a></div></article><article><a href="/podcasts/the-bill-simmons-podcast/2026/02/05/bill-simmons-zach-lowe-live-nba-trade-deadline-reaction-anthony-davis-james-harden"><div><div><img alt="" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2026%2F02%2F2-4_BS_Pod_Thumb_No_Text.jpg&amp;w=384&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=a8b73fcf73f629560bb508a5483df024a46b0236"></div></div></a><div><div><a href="/topic/nba">NBA</a></div><a href="/podcasts/the-bill-simmons-podcast/2026/02/05/bill-simmons-zach-lowe-live-nba-trade-deadline-reaction-anthony-davis-james-harden"><p>NBA Trade Deadline Reactions and Super Bowl Picks With Zach Lowe and Joe House</p><div><div>NBA Trade Deadline Reactions and Super Bowl Picks With Zach Lowe and Joe House</div><div>NBA Trade Deadline Reactions and Super Bowl Picks</div><div>NBA Trade Deadline Reactions and SB Picks</div></div></a><div><div><svg><path></path></svg></div><div><svg><path></path></svg></div><div><div><a href="/podcasts/the-bill-simmons-podcast"><div>The Bill Simmons Podcast</div><div><div>The Bill Simmons Podcast</div></div></a><span> • Feb. 5</span><span> • 2 hr 3 min</span></div></div></div></div><div><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3fr6c92ENQE96rvTfUOGTZ"><svg><path></path></svg></a></div></article></div><p>It’s sobering to see how little Davis fetched on the open market just a year after the Mavericks blew up a Finals team to acquire him. But Dallas had to do this—not this trade, exactly, but something like it. The Mavericks were never an Anthony Davis team, and any chance they had to become one fell away when they ping-ponged into drafting Cooper Flagg. The past nine months have seen the franchise gradually coming to terms with that fact. Wednesday’s trade doesn’t right any wrongs, but it at least shows that the Mavs finally have their priorities straight. The only timeline that matters now is Flagg’s. As he goes, they go. As he develops, they develop. </p><div></div><p>Frankly, Flagg has already been so remarkable as to make a blockbuster decision like this a bit easier. There’s no need to force the best thing the Mavericks have going into a veteran-driven formula—particularly when that formula relied so heavily on Davis, who missed almost two-thirds of the games during his Dallas tenure, and Kyrie Irving, who hasn’t played a game in almost a year. That version of the Mavericks was a wish. What Flagg is doing is <em>real</em>. When a 19-year-old is <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2026/01/14/nba/cooper-flagg-dallas-mavericks-rookie-of-the-year">already playing like a star</a>, just about everything else is secondary.</p><div><a href="https://nbarankings.theringer.com/the-offer-sheet"></a><div><div><div></div><span>Special Project</span></div><div><p>NBA Trade Deadline Reactions: All the Biggest Deals</p><div><div>NBA Trade Deadline Reactions: All the Biggest Deals</div><div>NBA Trade Deadline Tracker</div></div></div></div><div><img alt="" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2026%2F02%2FOfferSheetTradeDeadlineBookcase-DeadlineDay_Getty-Ringer-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=a8b73fcf73f629560bb508a5483df024a46b0236"></div></div><p>In a perfect world, Dallas could embrace a full-scale rebuild around Flagg, Christie, and Dereck Lively II (who underwent season-ending foot surgery in December). In the messier reality, the Mavs will likely still walk some middle path. Even if Matt Riccardi and Michael Finley (who are co-running the team on an interim basis) tore this roster down to the studs, no amount of cost cutting and liquidation would change the fact that after 2026, the Mavs won’t have control of their first-round draft picks for the next four years. Dallas was good enough to risk its future picks while trying to contend, and foolish enough to trade away the reason it was good enough to make those gambles in the first place. Given the circumstances, bringing back even two first-rounders in the trade for Davis—underwhelming as those picks ar<span>e</span>—feels meaningful. Dallas needs the means to add more young talent, clearly, but also the assets to maneuver. First-round picks open doors. They give a team the currency to clear salary, work the angles in negotiation, or widen the scope of a trade. The Mavericks may not have control of their own tanking destiny, but any future firsts at all could facilitate movement for what was one of the most logjammed teams in the league. Dallas had an expensive roster bound for the play-in at best, bereft of draft capital. Trading Davis may not have fetched an amazing return, but it materially changed the Mavericks’ circumstances nonetheless.</p><p>Dallas no longer has to worry about when Davis might return to the floor after suffering ligament damage in his hand. It doesn’t have to make peace with those sorts of injuries while working out the details of an extension that could easily pay Davis upward of $60 million a season. The Mavs were a lottery-bound team staring down the second apron, which in this salary cap environment amounts to a death sentence. Trading Davis gave them a way out, or at least the start of one. Cleaning up the rest of the roster will take patience, savvy, and, more than anything: time.</p><div><div></div><p>More Trade Deadline Moves and Speculation<!-- --> </p><div><div><button>Articles</button><button>Podcasts</button></div><div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div></div><p>More Trade Deadline Moves and Speculation<!-- --> </p><div><div><button>Articles</button><button>Podcasts</button></div><div></div><div></div></div></div><p>That’s a luxury a team with Davis, who will turn 33 next month, can’t really afford. Washington has clearly leaned into a sense of urgency by trading for both Davis and Trae Young, declaring its intentions to compete for a playoff spot as soon as next season. It also now has one of the most expensive rosters in the league. Davis is a tremendous player who covers ground and disrupts plays on defense with the best of them—<em>when healthy</em>. That caveat just weighs more heavily with every passing season, as AD’s injuries mount and his salary continues to climb. The combination of the two is prohibitive enough that only a small subset of teams could talk themselves into absorbing Davis’s deal and all that comes with it. The market is what it is, as Dallas can attest. Washington just has enough emerging talent on rookie-scale contracts to at least try to think about the finances a bit differently.</p><div></div><p>With that comes a fresh start for Davis and the Mavericks both. So long as he stayed in Dallas, AD would have been tied to the bleakest moment in franchise history, his every accomplishment held up to Luka’s standard. And so long as Davis was around, the Mavericks would be burdened by the circumstances of his arrival and everything it cost. This move is a mercy for a team and a star that were drowning in context. It might not feel like the most inspiring trade package in the moment, but this move is about anything but today. The future? Sure. The past? <em>Absolutely</em>. This is what moving on looks like. The real return is letting go.</p><div><div><div><div></div><div><a href="/creator/rob-mahoney"><img alt="" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F11%2FMahoney_Rob.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=a8b73fcf73f629560bb508a5483df024a46b0236"></a></div><div></div></div><div><a href="/creator/rob-mahoney"><div>Rob Mahoney</div><div><div>Rob Mahoney</div></div></a><span>Rob covers the NBA and pop culture for The Ringer.

            <p><strong>Editor's note</strong>: <em>Last week our fellow, Ella Markianos, pitched me on a novel experiment: attempting to use AI tools to do as much of her job as possible, and writing about the results. As her editor I can say with confidence that Ella is irreplaceable, and her job is hers as long as she wants it. Still, like Ella, I was curious what her investigation would find. Today, we publish her report. — Casey</em> </p><hr><p>As a young AI journalist, I spend a lot of time following the workers whose jobs are threatened by AI: recent CS grads, writers, people in entry-level roles. The ongoing collapse of the journalism business, highlighted by this week’s terrible cuts at the <em>Washington Post</em>, only serves to make those fears more acute.</p><p>As it so happens, I myself am a recent computer science grad in an entry-level writing role. And while we don’t yet have robots that can do on-the-ground reporting, large language models are becoming increasingly proficient at many of the tasks I am assigned each week.</p><p>One of my core responsibilities at <strong>Platformer</strong> is among the most computer-based tasks you can imagine. Along with my colleague Lindsey Choo, I write our Following section. In Following, we explain a news story and share what prominent people are saying about it on the internet.</p><p>I’ve long been worried that AI could upend the career in journalism that I’ve only just begun. My doubts are severe enough that I’ve spent hours wondering whether I should be pivoting toward my other skills. My totally irreplaceable skills, like… coding.</p><p>And so I did what anyone would do in my situation: size up my competition. I spent 20 hours building and customizing a Claude-based AI journalism agent that I named “Claudella” and the next several days investigating how well it could do my job.</p><p>Staying up until 6AM making frantic adjustments to Claudella, I discovered the strange allure of vibe coding your own replacement. I built a system that integrates pretty smoothly with all the apps <strong>Platformer</strong> uses to work and imitates my writing voice surprisingly well. And I oscillated between being heartened by Claudella’s dumb mistakes and genuinely scared that Claudella could do my job. </p><p>I was surprised how much my results improved after I made a concerted effort to give Claudella good instructions about how I work. </p><p>That included basics like attaching a style guide and extensive examples of the writing I wanted. It also included finicky fixes for helping my fledgling agent’s challenged search abilities. </p><p>By the end, I was surprised by how accurate Claudella’s work was, and how close its conclusions came to my own judgments. </p><p>It couldn’t write a one-liner to save its life. But it was ready for action.</p><h2>Claudella’s first day at work</h2><p>I wired up Claudella to shadow me on our work Discord. On day one, I gave it the same assignment I got from my editor.</p><figure><img src="https://www.platformer.news/content/images/2026/02/data-src-image-0b515af1-df7b-4f25-bba6-d1fa83608124.png" alt='Screenshot of a Discord interaction between Ella and Claudella in which Claudella says she prefers to be called an "enthusiastic assistant"'></figure><p>Claudella was a bit coy about her potential to replace me. But it took to the job quickly, instantly taking on her new assignment.</p><figure><img src="https://www.platformer.news/content/images/2026/02/data-src-image-0c758268-629b-423f-b3a1-3f678884e21a.png" alt="Screenshot of a Discord interaction between Ella and Claudella in which Claudella says it will take 30-60 seconds to complete a task"></figure><p>Claudella’s turnaround rate was a lot faster than mine, although it tended towards two minutes instead of the 30 to 60 seconds that it promised Casey when he asked (rude).</p><p>Unfortunately, Claudella’s first assignment went south quickly. For one thing, the bot failed to realize that I’d already sent it a PDF it was asking for. For another, it immediately ran out of Anthropic API credits and refused to continue working until we rectified the situation.</p><figure><img src="https://www.platformer.news/content/images/2026/02/data-src-image-22d08b1a-905e-4d79-8086-8e1f13073159.png" alt="Screenshot of a Discord interaction between Ella and Claudella in which the bot breaks because it didn't have any API credits left. Casey responds &quot;Claudella really just said: I don't work for free&quot;"></figure><p>I forked over the cash for some additional API credits. But Claudella’s second draft was also a dud, thanks to a random technical issue. </p><p>We organize the links in each edition of <strong>Platformer</strong> in a Notion database, and mark them as “used” once they have made it into a draft. Claudella skipped over the used links when writing news briefs, causing it to miss important information. I know to use all the relevant links, but my fledgling agent wasn’t equipped to do that.</p><p>By the third draft, though, Claudella was turning heads. Lindsey reported that she was surprised by how well my creation did our job. And despite a few errors, I was pretty happy with Claudella’s work myself. The bot wisely agreed with me that many “AI-related” layoffs were just spin from CEOs looking for cover, and it found some relevant X posts I hadn’t managed to find myself.</p><h2>Claudella’s second day at work</h2><p>After a solid first day, I decided it was time for Claudella to try its hand at a storied benchmark in the history of AI: the Turing test.</p><p>I would present two versions of <strong>Platformer</strong>’s Following section for the day to Casey: one, the genuine human-written piece that would go in the newsletter; the other, an AI counterfeit. I asked Casey to guess which was which. Thankfully, this time Claudella’s first draft was good enough to submit for consideration.</p><p>I turned in Lindsey's and my painstaking creation, “Elon consolidates the X empire,” alongside Claudella’s rapidly generated effort, “Musk’s $1.25 trillion mega-merger.”</p><p>There were no glaring hallmarks of AI writing in the latter: nary a “you’re absolutely right” was in sight, and Claudella’s use of em dashes was no more egregious than mine. As the moment of judgment arrived, I wondered if there was anything that would give away the AI authorship — or if I really might be cooked.</p><p>As it turns out, I needn’t have worried.</p><figure><img src="https://www.platformer.news/content/images/2026/02/data-src-image-3cc3de9e-7fdc-444a-bbb9-84a93a0108f5.png" alt="Screenshot of a Discord interaction between Ella and Casey in which Casey guesses correctly which brief was written by Ella"></figure><p>This time, I think the real giveaway was our “Why we’re following” subsection, where we collect online commentary. Despite me feeding Claudella a bunch of examples from previous editions, the model drifted toward a very sincere and verbose style, adding lots of unnecessary detail. (I tend to go more concise and sarcastic.)</p><p>I wrote three sentences for my version, and Claudella wrote seven. My ending line had been, “We hope he will use his power wisely (as he has failed to do in the past).” Claudella’s was “Meanwhile, xAI is facing a host of new regulatory probes, including by authorities in Europe, India, Australia and California, after its Grok AI tools enabled users to easily generate and share sexualized images of children and non-consensual intimate images of adults.”</p><p>The earliest version of Claudella would often hallucinate; I fixed that by adding very strict sourcing instructions to my prompts. But the new version would sometimes link to an article that didn’t support its (true) claims. That’s the sort of error that editors find annoying to track down and fix.</p><h2>What a bot can't do</h2><p>I could view the Claudella experiment through the lens of human exceptionalism and say that my bot is missing the style and humor that can only spring forth from the human soul. I might say that it occasionally hallucinates because it lacks “real intelligence.” But I think a lot of what's missing will simply be fixed by improvements in what the AI companies call “instruction following.” </p><p>I saw a version of this myself. Claudella improved significantly after I gave it examples and a step-by-step guide to catch the errors it was making. The process was not unlike the mentoring I receive when Casey and I talk about my writing. But because I’m working with a text-based language model, Claudella always needs written instructions.</p><p>Unfortunately, at a certain point too many instructions make the system start behaving erratically. It gets confused by my micromanaging. For example, I wanted Claudella to evaluate our commentary roundup for length, shortening it if there weren’t any particularly juicy posts that day. But when I explicitly asked for concision, the model got confused and forgot to write the roundup section altogether.</p><p>This could make me hesitant to give Claudella the feedback it dearly needed — that it was being too serious and too wordy for the task at hand. In those cases I said nothing, because I didn’t want to upset the rickety pile of sticks that held my fledgling AI journalism agent together.</p><p>Properly solving these issues might require AIs to do “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/continual-learning?ref=platformer.news"><u>continual learning</u></a>” analogous to the way humans do — receiving regular feedback and incorporating it into how they work.</p><p>Although continual learning is currently a major focus for AI researchers, I suspect many shortcomings will be patched just by improving AIs’ ability to process more written instructions.</p><p>Which brings us to today.</p><h2>Claudella 4.6</h2><p>Fortunately, I had a perfect opportunity to see how a change in AI capabilities would affect the AI’s ability to do my job: Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6?ref=platformer.news">released</a> an update to Claude this morning. I decided to test my original agentic setup with the new model.</p><p>My first test was of the new model’s sense of humor. Asked to make a joke about a research task I had given it, 4.5 landed a better one-liner than 4.6 did, at least in my opinion. </p><p>I then repeated the key task I had given 4.5 earlier in the week: to write one of today’s Following items. And I set up a blind taste test by having Claude Code rename and reset the time stamps on the files for me so I couldn’t tell which was which.</p><p>But the result was obvious from the start. Even headlines were of noticeably different quality. One had written “AI-fueled panic wipes $285 billion from software stocks” as its title. The other went with “Welcome to the 'SaaSpocalypse',” which is more my style. (Sometimes, seeing myself reflected in Claude reminds me how annoying I am.)</p><p>I was a bit disappointed with the “wipes $285 billion” article. While it hit the right beats, it also included some extraneous details, such as when it decided to list the names of all 11 Cowork plugins Anthropic released this week (shill much, Claudella?). It also failed to add line breaks to our commentary roundup, which made it unreadable.</p><p>My other Claudella handled the line breaks. Its style was closer to my own, offering more cheek and drama (e.g. “The fear gripping Wall Street is fundamentally about whether AI is about to eat the software industry alive.”) It also included three of the same quotes I had chosen in my own roundup.</p><p>This second model — which turned out to be 4.6 — was clearly the winner. The Opus 4.6 update followed my instructions better, and produced writing that was far more stylish.</p><p>It still has a ways to go: about half of the piece needed to be cut, and the model had a penchant for ten-dollar words and amplifiers like “fundamentally” that I found annoying. And you can’t judge a model’s true quality by a single day of testing.</p><p>Still, there was something unsettling about feeling the AI frontier advance under my feet just a few days into this experiment.</p><h2>What I learned</h2><p>I went into this project with some anxiety about whether AI is poised to take my job. Overall, this experiment exacerbated my fears. In important ways, Claudella <em>can</em> do my job.</p><p>But it also has clear shortcomings. In particular, it has trouble understanding which parts of a style are important to replicate. It also struggles to respond to editor feedback. And when asked to write <em>about</em> AI, the Claude-based model shows a notably favorable bias toward Anthropic. (Which makes a second Anthropic-related conflict of interest for us here at <strong>Platformer</strong>. Casey’s boyfriend works there. Perhaps you’ve heard?)</p><p>Still, the bot’s work sometimes impressed me. And I saw a clear advance in ability today even from a relatively minor model update.</p><p>While I enjoyed seeing my AI agent get better at my job, I don't feel any desire to delegate my writing to it. I wouldn’t do it even if readers would accept it. As well as my AI mentee can now write, drafting is what I do to think. If I had Claude write my first drafts, even if I fact-checked them thoroughly, it would be a lot harder to tell whether the angle was my own view or the AI’s.</p><p>Still, I’ve decided to keep Claudella around. The bot excels at clip searches — looking for important quotes and analysis I might have missed. And I want to keep an eye on how quickly its skills improve.</p><p>And for me? The truth is that I’m less married to the idea of a career in journalism than I was at the beginning of this experiment.</p><p>I’ve had many conversations with my fellow AI reporters about what moats we might have against the advancement of AI automation. Chief among them are developing relationships with human sources, reporting on scenes in person, and getting scoops that people wouldn’t entrust an AI with.</p><p>But the things I love most about AI reporting are having an excuse to read really long computer science papers and then writing about them. I worry that if AI becomes a great writer and research assistant, AI journalism will mostly become about networking.</p><p>Regardless, I won't stop reading weird CS papers. And I won't stop writing. Not because I'm confident these skills will keep me employed, but because they're what I actually like doing.</p><figure><img src="https://www.platformer.news/content/images/2024/05/floating_linebreak_600px-1.png" alt=""></figure><p><strong>Sponsored</strong></p><h3>One in Five LLM Answers Was Russian Disinformation.

It <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/anthropic-claude-opus-4-6-first-try-work-deliverables/?ref=platformer.news"><u>scored</u></a> the highest <strong>BigLaw Bench</strong> score of any <strong>Claude</strong> model at 90.2%, and is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/anthropic-updates-ai-model-to-field-more-complex-financial-research?ref=platformer.news"><u>better at</u></a> scrutinizing company data, regulatory filings, and market information. The model has already found more than 500 previously unknown high-severity security flaws in open-source libraries, Anthropic <a href="https://www.axios.com/2026/02/05/anthropic-claude-opus-46-software-hunting?ref=platformer.news"><u>told</u></a> <em>Axios</em>.</p><p>Across town, OpenAI unceiled <strong>GPT-5.3-Codex</strong>. The company said it improves on the coding capabilities of its predecessor, GPT-5.2-Codex, and on the reasoning and knowledge capabilities of <strong>GPT-5.2</strong>. The new model <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/openai-gpt-5-3-codex-faster-goes-beyond-coding/?ref=platformer.news"><u>also runs</u></a> 25 percent faster than previous models, and was the company’s “first model that was instrumental in creating itself,” it <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex/?ref=platformer.news"><u>said</u></a>. Rounding out the hype, OpenAI says 5.3 can go beyond coding to “do nearly anything developers and professionals can do on a computer.”</p><p>Speaking of the Super Bowl: the simultaneous release of the two models comes amid a very public fight over Anthropic’s debut ad for the Big game, where the company <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/anthropic-takes-aim-at-openais-chatgpt-in-super-bowl-ad-debut-e38d08bb?st=jxp4u7&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&amp;ref=platformer.news"><u>took aim</u></a> at the idea of ads in chatbots like <strong>ChatGPT</strong> — and explained its decision to not have ads in Claude in <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think?ref=platformer.news"><u>an accompanying blog post</u></a>. </p><p>In response, OpenAI CEO <strong>Sam Altman</strong> penned a scathing <strong>X</strong> <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/2019139174339928189?ref=platformer.news"><u>post</u></a>, where he called the ad “clearly dishonest.” “We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that,” Altman wrote. </p><p><strong>Why we’re following:  </strong>Anthropic's Super Bowl ad didn't mention any competitors by name, but still seemed notably more punchy than the company's typical communications. And it's fair to ask whether it was a tactical mistake — if you truly believe ads are going to ruin your competitors' products, why not let it simply happen? Never interrupt your enemy while he's making a mistake and all that.</p><p>But Altman's aggrieved response may have justified the approach, if only in hindsight. Pushed into doubling down on an approach he had previously called a "last resort," Altman was left pushing the dubious idea that Anthropic's $20-a-month product is "only for rich people" and its move to cut competitors off from its coding tools is "authoritarian" in nature. Anthropic could not have asked for better earned media, and the Super Bowl hasn't even happened yet.</p><p>As for the dueling models: it's too early to say which is superior for coding and other tasks. In limited early testing, Casey found 4.6 to represent a meaningful step forward at writing tasks — a meaningful step forward over 4.5, which was itself a notable improvement over its predecessor. Codex we are still (candidly) getting the hang of. </p><p><strong>What people are saying: </strong></p><p>“Anthropic vs openai is like kendrick vs drake but for nerds,” <a href="https://x.com/sonofalli/status/2019269095187783955?ref=platformer.news"><u>wrote</u></a> <strong>@sonofalli</strong> on an X post that has garnered more than 180,000 views. </p><p>Altman’s lengthy Super Bowl ad crashout set off a firestorm of jokes, many of them not in his favor. <strong>@paularambles</strong> <a href="https://x.com/paularambles/status/2019309929493094813?s=46&amp;ref=platformer.news"><u>highlighted</u></a> the silliness of the entire feud on X: “the best minds of my generation are thinking about ads about ads.” </p><p>“Can’t believe anthropic rage baited the guy and he fell for it. he’s even using capital letters in this tweet, they broke him,” <strong>@alxfazio</strong> <a href="https://x.com/alxfazio/status/2019314772391420153?s=20&amp;ref=platformer.news"><u>posted</u></a>.</p><p><strong>@robj3d3</strong> <a href="https://x.com/robj3d3/status/2019372218225201263?ref=platformer.news"><u>posted</u></a> an excellent meme:</p><p>“sama: "Anthropic's ads are not a threat"</p><p>also sama:</p><figure><img src="https://www.platformer.news/content/images/2026/02/HAZAPKSbkAAqMt8.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p><em>—Lindsey Choo and Casey Newton</em></p><hr><h3>People are worried that AI will kill SaaS</h3><p><strong>What happened:</strong> A release of legal tools in <strong>Anthropic</strong>’s <strong>Cowork</strong> product triggered a big software stock selloff. </p><p>It's the latest chapter in months of software companies’ stocks declining as fears of AI disruption mount; the <strong>IGV Software Index</strong> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-wont-kill-the-software-business-just-its-growth-story-05673e07?st=dY58vx&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&amp;ref=platformer.news"><u>has dropped</u></a> 30% since September.</p><p>Spurring these declines is anxiety that AI coding might soon substitute for the enterprise software these companies make their money on. Companies including <strong>Microsoft</strong> and <strong>ServiceNow</strong> have reported underwhelming revenue this quarter, which doesn’t help.</p><p>But SaaS companies aren’t the only ones having a bit of trouble. The <em>Financial Times </em>reports that chip company <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/39aa0fd6-957e-48a5-bb91-d503ed441ff6?ref=platformer.news"><strong><u>Arm</u></strong></a> has dropped 8% because their revenue report came in only slightly higher than analysts’ forecasts. They stand to benefit from AI, given their CPU designs are in high demand as a component for data centers. But in a period of high anxiety about tech stocks, apparently that's not enough.</p><p><strong>Why we’re following: </strong>AI definitely can do some impressive coding. But there isn’t clear evidence that the coding software AI companies are making substitutes for the specialized enterprise software SaaS companies sell. (Or for the logistical services and customer support that are often needed to make SaaS work in most organizations.) Professional software is valuable in large part because of its reliability. While we've seen plenty of cool AI coding projects, we haven’t yet seen evidence that they can substitute for the total package that good SaaS companies are selling to their customers.</p><p>At the same time, AI coding <em>has</em> gotten dramatically better in the past few years, and presumably that trend will continue. We can’t entirely blame sellers for extrapolating an upward trend.</p><p><strong>What people are saying:</strong> </p><p>Arm’s CEO <strong>René Haas</strong> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/39aa0fd6-957e-48a5-bb91-d503ed441ff6?ref=platformer.news">called</a> the dip in tech stocks a “micro-hysteria,” suggesting it came from a misunderstanding of the impact AI is having on software, in an interview with the <em>FT</em>.</p><p>On <strong>X</strong>, <strong>Garry Tan, </strong>CEO of startup incubator <strong>Y Combinator</strong>, <a href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/2018836098252968335?ref=platformer.news"><u>said that</u></a> software absolutely has a future.

        <hr/>
        <div><p>There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them.</p><p>Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDNkDBNR7AM">ad campaigns</a>, and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry.</p><p>But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.</p><p>We want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests. So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see “sponsored” links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.</p><h2><strong>The nature of AI conversations</strong></h2><p>When people use search engines or social media, they’ve come to expect a mixture of organic and sponsored content. Filtering signal from noise is part of the interaction.</p><p>Conversations with AI assistants are meaningfully different. The format is open-ended; users often share context and reveal more than they would in a search query. This openness is part of what makes conversations with AI valuable, but it’s also what makes them susceptible to influence in ways that other digital products are not.</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/how-people-use-claude-for-support-advice-and-companionship">analysis of conversations</a> with Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/clio">private and anonymous</a>) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal—the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.</p><p>We still have much to learn about the impact of AI models on the people who use them. <a href="https://www.jmir.org/2025/1/e67114">Early</a> <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/exploring-the-dangers-of-ai-in-mental-health-care">research</a> suggests both benefits—like people finding support they couldn’t access elsewhere—and risks, including the potential for models to reinforce harmful beliefs in vulnerable users. Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity. <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model">Our understanding</a> of how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results.</p><h2><strong>Incentive structures</strong></h2><p>Being genuinely helpful is one of the core principles of <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/constitution">Claude’s Constitution</a>, the document that describes our vision for Claude’s character and guides how we train the model. An advertising-based business model would introduce incentives that could work against this principle.</p><p>Consider a concrete example. A user mentions they’re having trouble sleeping. An assistant without advertising incentives would explore the various potential causes—stress, environment, habits, and so on—based on what might be most insightful to the user. An ad-supported assistant has an additional consideration: whether the conversation presents an opportunity to make a transaction. These objectives may often align—but not always. And, unlike a list of search results, ads that influence a model’s responses may make it difficult to tell whether a given recommendation comes with a commercial motive or not. Users shouldn’t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.</p><p>Even ads that don’t directly influence an AI model’s responses and instead appear separately within the chat window would compromise what we want Claude to be: a clear space to think and work. Such ads would also introduce an incentive to optimize for engagement—for the amount of time people spend using Claude and how often they return. These metrics aren’t necessarily aligned with being genuinely helpful. The most useful AI interaction might be a short one, or one that resolves the user’s request without prompting further conversation.</p><p>We recognize that not all advertising implementations are equivalent. More transparent or opt-in approaches—where users explicitly choose to see sponsored content—might avoid some of the concerns outlined above. But the history of ad-supported products suggests that advertising incentives, once introduced, tend to expand over time as they become integrated into revenue targets and product development, blurring boundaries that were once more clear-cut. We’ve chosen not to introduce these dynamics into Claude.</p><h2><strong>Our approach</strong></h2><p>Anthropic is focused on businesses, developers, and helping our users flourish. Our business model is straightforward: we generate revenue through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, and we reinvest that revenue into improving Claude for our users. This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions.</p><p>Expanding access to Claude is central to our public benefit mission, and we want to do it without selling our users’ attention or data to advertisers. To that end, we’ve <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-teach-for-all">brought AI tools and training to educators</a> in over 60 countries, begun national AI education pilots with <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-and-iceland-announce-one-of-the-world-s-first-national-ai-education-pilots">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/rwandan-government-partnership-ai-education">governments</a>, and made Claude <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-nonprofits">available to nonprofits</a> at a significant discount. We continue to invest in our smaller models so that our free offering remains at the frontier of intelligence, and we may consider lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing where there is clear demand for it. Should we need to revisit this approach, we’ll be transparent about our reasons for doing so.</p><h2><strong>Supporting commerce</strong></h2><p>AI will increasingly interact with commerce, and we look forward to supporting this in ways that help our users. We’re particularly interested in the potential of agentic commerce, where Claude acts on a user’s behalf to handle a purchase or booking end to end. And we’ll continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare, or buy products, connect with businesses, and more—when they choose to do so.</p><p>We’re also exploring more ways to make Claude a focused space to be at your most productive. Users can already <a href="https://claude.com/blog/interactive-tools-in-claude">connect third-party tools</a> they use for work—like Figma, Asana, and Canva—and interact with them directly within Claude. We expect to introduce many more useful integrations and expand this toolkit over time.</p><p>All third-party interactions will be grounded in the same overarching design principle: they should be initiated by the <em>user </em>(where the AI is working for them) rather than an <em>advertiser</em> (where the AI is working, at least in part, for someone else). Today, whether someone asks Claude to research running shoes, compare mortgage rates, or recommend a restaurant for a special occasion, Claude’s only incentive is to give a helpful answer. We’d like to preserve that.</p><h2><strong>A trusted tool for thought</strong></h2><p>We want our users to trust Claude to help them keep thinking—about their work, their challenges, and their ideas.</p><p>Our experience of using the internet has made it easy to assume that advertising on the products we use is inevitable. But open a notebook, pick up a well-crafted tool, or stand in front of a clean chalkboard, and there are no ads in sight.</p><p>We think Claude should work the same way.</p><p><br></p></div>

    <p>The world is in a constant state of flux. Humans and other animals evolved the ability to learn to help them thrive in adversity. For example, if one food supply runs out, figuring out how to eat something else can ensure survival. </p>
<p>But not all animals are as capable. Koalas cannot even recognize their primary food source—eucalyptus leaves—if the leaves are removed from a tree and placed in a pile on a plate. While koalas sometimes eat other leaves from other trees, they can conceive of food only as “leaves on trees.” Their smooth brains cannot deviate from this expectation. </p>
<p>Consider a computer vision model intended for use in self-driving cars. The model must know how to recognize other vehicles on the road, but also pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, animals and hazards. It must perceive and adapt flawlessly to changing weather and traffic patterns, such as a sudden downpour or if an emergency vehicle is approaching with its lights and siren on. </p>
<p>Languages change over time. A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing"><u>natural language processing (NLP)</u></a> model should be able to process shifts in what words mean and how they are used. Similarly, a model designed for robotics must be able to adapt if the robot’s environment changes. </p>

                After a U.S.-led investor group took over the social media platform's U.S. operations earlier this year, some users claimed political topics were quashed. New research contradicts their claims.

   <p>As a consortium of investors led by Oracle's Larry Ellison <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/18/nx-s1-5648844/tiktok-deal-oracle-trump">took control</a> of TikTok's U.S. business, users accused the app of throttling videos about Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and posts related to the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.</p>   <p><a href="https://x.com/BarleyTheBurr/status/2015467020872007926?s=20">Posts</a> went <a href="https://x.com/IbaraEleven/status/1881730569748578640">viral</a> on <a href="https://x.com/ggreenwald/status/2016871502574997639?s=20">social media</a> pinning the perceived suppression of content on TikTok's new bosses.

   <p>Using viewership metrics across more than 100,000 videos, the researchers zeroed in on videos about ICE, Pretti, Renee Good, the woman killed by an ICE agent last month and the keywords "Trump" and "Epstein." They compared how often TikTok recommended the content compared with non-political posts about things like food recipes and the Oscars.</p>   <p>Around the time of TikTok's server outage, "posts about all of these topics dropped to almost zero," wrote Benjamin Guinaudeau, a professor at Université Laval in Québec, and his seven co-authors. "Total views plummeted directly after the TikTok outage, and then began to rebound."</p>   <p>While cries of systemic top-down political censorship do not appear to be supported by publicly available data, the researchers say it is still possible the new owners of TikTok have begun to reconfigure content rules.</p>   <p>"It could be that small numbers of posts were removed or shadowbanned in a way that is not visible in the overall trends," wrote the researchers, who added that users who experienced that the word "Epstein" was being blocked in private direct messages was not possible to study, since that data is not accessible.</p>   <p>Part of the challenge in studying TikTok, the academics note, is that the platform does not grant the type of access to researchers required to do comprehensive reviews of how content moderation is unfolding — what is being amplified, what is being suppressed and what priorities or policies may be driving those trends.</p>   <aside>

   <p>"Our position is that TikTok and other platforms should provide a way for third-party researchers to study their recommender systems and look for evidence of undue political influence," the researchers wrote.</p>   <p>The timing of the TikTok disruption struck a nerve because many users have expressed wariness about how Ellison, a staunch ally of President Trump, could remake the app in his vision, just as the Ellison family has overhauled CBS in bid to appeal to conservatives.</p>   <p>"The new owners will have to earn the trust of Americans. Because the TikTok law effectively gave the president the power to select the new owners, TikTok U.S. will have to show that it is not biased in his favor," said Anupam Chander, a professor of law and technology at Georgetown University. "It could demonstrate its political neutrality by welcoming academic researchers and by hiring well-respected liberals within the company."</p>   <p>In addition to Ellison's Oracle, a cloud computing and data center giant, TikTok's new investors include Silver Lake, a prominent private equity firm, and Emirati-based investment company MGX. </p>   <p>ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, will keep a minority stake of the new U.S. entity, as well as still own the powerful algorithm. It will be retrained using Americans' data. </p>   <p>Backers of the U.S. entity insist China will not be able to exert control over the algorithm, which will be supervised by Oracle. Yet since the technology will not be sold away from Beijing, some observers question the arrangement. </p>   <p>A TikTok spokeswoman said no changes have been made to its algorithm since the new investors took the reins of the social media company's American business. The deal was struck to bring the app in compliance with a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/24/1246663779/biden-ban-tiktok-us">federal law</a> that required TikTok distance itself from its Chinese parent company over national security concerns.</p>   <p>"Right now, TikTok can say just about anything related to algorithm changes and we can't verify it," Guinaudeau told NPR.</p>   <aside>

   <p>He added: "Now we could see massive changes like if they suddenly stopped showing all political content, which was one of the accusations we examine in the post. But until they make more extensive data available to researchers it's nearly impossible to detect subtle changes to their 'For You' recommender system ('the algorithm')."</p>

<p>Google’s AI chatbot Gemini has surpassed 750 million monthly active users (MAUs), according to the company’s <a href="https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/2025q4-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf">fourth-quarter 2025 earnings</a>. This figure illustrates the rapid consumer adoption of Gemini, which has quickly become a prominent player in the AI space.</p>

<p>Last quarter, Google reported 650 million monthly active users for Gemini, indicating substantial growth in a short period. In comparison, Meta AI has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-ai-has-nearly-500-million-users/">reported </a>nearly 500 million monthly users. However, while Gemini is gaining traction, it still trails behind its biggest rival, ChatGPT, which is estimated to have around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/chatgpts-user-growth-has-slowed-report-finds/">810 million MAUs</a> in late 2025.</p>

<p>The recently revealed number comes on the heels of the launch of Gemini 3, which showcases the company’s most advanced model yet, providing responses that the company claims exhibit an unprecedented level of depth and nuance. </p>

<p>CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted that the introduction of Gemini 3 in AI mode was a “positive driver” for the company’s growth and emphasized that continued investment and iteration will maintain this momentum.</p>

<p>Google recently rolled out a more affordable plan, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/googles-ai-plus-plan-rolls-out-to-all-markets-including-the-u-s/">the Google AI Plus</a>, priced at $7.99 per month. The plan is expected to drive further growth by appealing to budget-conscious consumers, although it was made available too recently to have any influence on the quarterly figures.</p>

<p>“We are focused on a free tier and subscriptions and seeing great growth,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said during the call to investors. </p>

<p>Gemini’s growth is particularly notable given Alphabet’s overall financial performance. The company has surpassed $400 billion in annual revenue for the first time this quarter. Google attributes the achievement to the expansion of its AI division, which has seen increased demand. Recently, Google introduced the latest generation of its TPU AI accelerator chip, called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/google-unveils-ironwood-a-new-ai-accelerator-chip/">Ironwood</a>, to compete with Nvidia.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Anthropic released the latest version of Opus — its most advanced model and a particularly important model for Claude Code. Opus 4.5 was only released <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude/opus">last November</a>, and with 4.6, the company has sought to broaden its model’s capabilities and appeal, allowing for a greater variety of uses and customers.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most notable addition to the newest version of Opus is the inclusion of what the company calls “agent teams” — teams of agents that can split larger tasks into segmented jobs.</p>

<p>“Instead of one agent working through tasks sequentially, you can split the work across multiple agents — each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others,” the company says. Scott White, Head of Product at Anthropic, compared the new feature to having a talented team of humans working for you, noting that the segmenting of agent responsibilities allows them “to coordinate in parallel [and work] faster.” The agent teams are currently available in a research preview for API users and subscribers.</p>

<p>Opus 4.6 also comes with a longer context window — meaning that the program has a capacity to recall a greater amount of information per user session. The new model offers 1 million tokens of context, which is comparable to what the company’s Sonnet (versions 4 and 4.5) <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows">currently offers</a>. Those context windows allow for work involving larger code bases and can also allow for the processing of larger documents, the company says.</p>

<p>The new version of Opus also integrates Claude directly into PowerPoint as an accessible side panel. This is a step up from PowerPoint’s previous integration with the chatbot. Previously, a user could tell Claude to create a PowerPoint deck, but the file would then have to be transferred to PowerPoint to edit the presentation, White said. Now the presentation can be crafted within PowerPoint, with direct help from Claude.</p>

<p>White told TechCrunch that Opus has evolved from a model that was highly capable in one particular domain — software development — into a program that could be “really useful for a broader set” of knowledge workers. “We noticed a lot of people who are not professional software developers using Claude Code simply because it was a really amazing engine to do tasks,” he said. White added that the kinds of people the company has seen using it include not just software engineers, but product managers, financial analysts, and people from a variety of other industries.</p>

        <div><p><span><a href="/quotes/RDDT/">Reddit</a><span><span><button><span></span></button></span></span></span> shares rose 5% in after-hours trading Thursday after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat on the top and bottom lines and gave strong guidance for the start of 2026.</p><p>Here's how the company did compared with LSEG estimates:</p><ul><li><strong>Earnings per share: </strong>$1.24 vs. 94 cents expected</li><li><strong>Revenue: </strong>$726 million vs. $665 million expected</li></ul><div></div><p>The company said it expects first-quarter sales to come in the range of $595 million to $605 million, which is higher than Wall Street expectations of $577 million. Adjusted earnings in the first quarter are projected to come in between $210 million and $220 million, ahead of StreetAccount's estimates of $203 million.</p><p>Reddit also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.</p><p>The company's fourth-quarter revenue rose 70% year over year, while net income was $252 million, up nearly 255% from the same period a year ago.</p><p>Reddit's sales in the U.S. market came in at $583 million in the fourth quarter, topping analyst estimates of $529 million.</p><p>The company's global daily active uniques, or DAUq, grew 19% year over year to 121.4 million in the fourth quarter, ahead of the 120 million that Wall Street was expecting.</p><div></div><p>Fourth-quarter U.S. DAUq grew 9% year over year to 52.5 million, slightly ahead of the 52.3 million that analysts were projecting.</p><p>The company said that logged-in DAUq for the U.S., which refers to users who have registered for Reddit accounts, rose 5% year over year to 23 million. That was slower than the 7% year over year growth Reddit said it<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/reddit-rddt-q3-2025.html"> recorded during the third quarter</a> when its logged-in DAUq for the U.S. came in at 23.1 million. This is the sixth straight quarter in which Reddit's U.S. logged-in user growth has slowed.</p><p>Investors have been monitoring<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/14/reddits-increased-reliance-on-google-traffic-has-wall-street-anxious.html"> Reddit's logged-in DAUq metric</a> because users who have created accounts are more lucrative to the company's online advertising business. These Reddit account holders generally use the platform and engage with other users more frequently than those who may have stumbled into Reddit via <span><a href="/quotes/GOOGL/">Google</a><span><span><button><span></span></button></span></span></span> search, which the company refers to as logged-out DAUq.</p><p>In an investor letter, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the company plans to "phase out reporting on logged-in and logged-out later this year" because there's now less of a distinction between the two metrics than in the past. That's because the company has been working on features intended to keep both logged-in users and logged-out users glued to the platform, Huffman said.</p><p>"As the industry evolves, how we think about our product and users must evolve too," Huffman wrote. "We've historically reported logged-in vs. logged-out users, but as some of our work to streamline onboarding — instant personalization, for example — blurs the line between these states, the distinction between them makes less sense."</p><p>Reddit finance chief Drew Vollero told analysts during an earnings call that the company will continue to report both metrics for the first two quarters of 2026.</p><p>Regarding the company's data-licensing deals with <span><a href="/quotes/GOOGL/">Google</a><span><span><button><span></span></button></span></span></span> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/openai-cnbc-disruptor-50.html">OpenAI</a>, Huffman said during the earnings call that "relationships with both companies are very healthy" and that "the conversation is shifting from a purely business deal to more of a product partnership."</p><p>"Specifically, what we're looking for in any relationship like this is can we bring users into the community parts of Reddit,"  Huffman said. </p><p>Regarding Reddit's efforts to unify its traditional search tool with its more <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/09/reddit-begins-testing-ai-powered-answers-feature-to-win-users.html">recent generative AI search feature</a>, Huffman said that the company has learned that "the GenAI search results will just be better for most queries."</p><p>Unlike traditional search, cutting-edge GenAI search and chat tools excel at providing results that contain "multiple perspectives from lots of people," he said.</p><p><strong>WATCH</strong>: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2026/02/05/snap-ceo-claims-independent-studies-show-the-platform-has-a-positive-impact-on-peoples-well-being.html">Snap CEO Evan Spiegel discusses social media and well-being</a>.</p></div>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt; Alphabet announced plans to nearly double Google's annual capital expenditure to as much as $185bn by 2026, driven by aggressive investment in AI infrastructure and data centers. Despite beating analyst expectations with $113.8bn in quarterly revenue and a 48% surge in cloud earnings, the massive spending forecast led to an initial 5% drop in share price. CEO Sundar Pichai defended the investment, citing record demand for Gemini AI models and cloud services, as the company's market cap recently surpassed $4tn.&lt;/p&gt;

This new large language model is an upgrade to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-opus-4-5-to-see-if-its-really-the-best-in-the-world-at-coding-and-things-got-weird-fast/">Opus 4.5</a>, with broader autonomy and more accurate first-try results.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/openai-gpt-5-3-codex-faster-goes-beyond-coding/">OpenAI's new GPT-5.3-Codex is 25% faster and goes way beyond coding now - what's new</a></strong></p><div><!----></div><p>Anthropic describes Opus 4.6 as a "frontier model" designed to handle complex end-to-end enterprise workflows. The term "frontier model" is used by the AI industry to describe AI systems that are at the leading edge of current AI capabilities.</p><p>Using Opus 4.6, "Documents, spreadsheets, and presentations will need less back-and-forth on iterations," according to an email ZDNET received from a company representative. </p><div><!----></div><h2> 	Performance leap for knowledge work </h2><p>Anthropic says, "For AI to truly tackle enterprise work, it must succeed at three key outcomes: finding information, analyzing it, and producing something from it." According to the company, 4.6 performs well across all three key outcomes. </p><div><!----></div><p>All this indicates a jump in the AI's agentic capabilities, with an ability to handle complex, long-run tasks in addition to isolated subtasks. </p><div><!----></div><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/claude-code-made-an-astonishing-1b-in-6-months-and-my-own-ai-coded-iphone-app-shows-why/">Claude Code made an astonishing $1B in 6 months - and my own AI-coded iPhone app shows why</a></strong></p><p>Using travel as an analogy, a simple subtask might be telling a driver to "turn right at the next light," while a more complex task would be to tell that driver located in New York City to drive to Faneuil Hall in Boston. It would be up to the driver to determine the steps and get there. Likewise, the idea with Opus 4.6's broader autonomy is that it can plan and execute the complex series of steps for larger-scale assignments.</p><div><!----></div><p>According to the company, Opus 4.6 also reduces the number of corrections and reframes required for "common enterprise deliverables."</p><p>According to Yashodha Bhavnani, head of AI at cloud storage vendor Box, "Claude Opus 4.6 excels in high-reasoning tasks, like multi-source analysis, across legal, financial, and technical content. Box's eval showed a 10% lift in performance, reaching 68% vs. a 58% baseline, and near-perfect scores in technical domains."</p><div><!----></div><div><!----></div><p><strong>Also: </strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-configure-claude-code-ai-pricing-developers/"><strong>How to install and configure Claude Code, step by step</strong></a></p><p>Anthropic is also positioning Claude Opus 4.6 as a valuable resource for financial modeling. The AI can help with regulatory filings, market reports, and internal data, producing rapid results for projects that would previously take analysts days to complete. Anthropic says Opus 4.6 "handles the nuance required for compliance-sensitive output." </p><div><!----></div><p>Opus 4.6 is proving to be powerful for legal reasoning as well. According to Niko Grupen, head of AI research at legal AI company <a href="https://www.harvey.ai/company">Harvey</a>, "Claude Opus 4.6 achieved the highest BigLaw Bench score of any Claude model at 90.2%. With 40% perfect scores and 84% above 0.8, it's remarkably capable for legal reasoning."</p><p>Another intriguing new capability is <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/claude-can-create-pdfs-slides-and-spreadsheets-for-you-now-in-chat/">Claude's integration with PowerPoint</a>. Once released, Claude will be able to work directly inside PowerPoint (presumably as a plugin) and be able to read layouts, fonts, and slide masters. This way, edits by the AI can stay "on-brand and on-template." </p><div><!----></div><div><!----></div><p><strong>Also: </strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/claude-code-alternative-free-local-open-source-goose-getting-started/"><strong>I tried a Claude Code alternative that's local, open source, and completely free - how it works</strong></a></p><p>According to the company, Claude Opus 4.6 can "build slides from a corporate template, restructure a storyline, convert bullets into diagrams, or generate a full deck from a description -- all without leaving the app." </p><p>The PowerPoint capability is in research preview, available for Max, Team, and Enterprise plans. </p><div><!----></div><h2> 	Developer and agent advances </h2><p>Claude is particularly well known for its <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-free-ai-for-coding-in-2025-only-3-make-the-cut-now/">agentic coding capabilities</a>. Claude Opus 4.6 builds on the strengths of Opus 4.5 with more agentic behavior. The company says that autonomous coding improvements will particularly benefit developers with large code bases, long-horizon tasks, and complex implementations. </p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/stop-using-chatgpt-ai-models-i-use-instead/">Stop using ChatGPT for everything: My go-to AI models for research, coding, and more (and which I avoid)</a></strong></p><div><!----></div><p>As a user of Claude Code, this brings to mind a key question. Claude Code using Opus 4.5 often needs to run compaction sequences that free up available resources. This process not only takes a long time, but it often interrupts project flow. </p><div><!----></div><p>If 4.6 is supposed to be able to address even larger code bases, then the context window needs to grow. Anthropic says that "Claude Opus 4.6 will support 1M context (in beta) at launch. This is the first Opus model with long context." It'll be very interesting to see that in action. </p><div><!----></div><h2> 	Agent teams </h2><p>The company is offering a research preview of agent teams in Claude Opus 4.6 to API and subscription Claude users. The company says teams "let Claude Code work the way a real engineering team does. Instead of one agent working through tasks sequentially, you can split the work across multiple agents -- each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others." </p><div><!----></div><p><strong>Also: </strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/anthropic-claude-cowork-ai-file-management-test/"><strong>I let Anthropic's Claude Cowork loose on my files, and it was both brilliant and scary</strong></a></p><p>I've been struggling with Claude running multiple parallel agents in Claude Code using Opus 4.5, particularly in the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/xcode-agentic-coding-apple-developer-tools/">Xcode 26.3 preview.</a> I've found that once the primary agent kicks off a series of subagents, they're not visible for my hands-on management. When one or more of them gets stuck (as they seem to do with disturbing regularity), the whole agentic coding process just hangs. </p><div><!----></div><div><!----></div><p>I'm hoping that agent teams in Claude Opus 4.6 provide better transparency, better overall management, and better damage control, so if they get stuck, they report back and ask for help. Stay tuned. I'll do some testing and report back on overall performance. </p><p>That said, Michele Catasta, president of AI no-code company <a href="https://replit.com/">Replit</a> says, "Claude Opus 4.6 is a huge leap for agentic planning. It breaks complex tasks into independent subtasks, runs tools and subagents in parallel, and identifies blockers with real precision."</p><div><!----></div><h2> 	Availability </h2><p>Anthropic says, "Claude Opus 4.6 is available today on claude.ai, our API, and all major cloud platforms." Token pricing hasn't changed from the previous release for API users. </p><p>Some features like PowerPoint, the 1M context, and agent teams are described as research previews or beta, and are not available for wide release at launch. But Anthropic is working on AI time. So items in research preview and beta are more likely to be weeks away than months away. After all, it does have an AI to help it code its products.</p><div><!----></div><div><!----></div><p><strong>Also: </strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/local-ai-coding-stack-replaces-claude-code-codex-free/"><strong>Want local vibe coding? This AI stack replaces Claude Code and Codex - and it's free</strong></a></p><p>What do you think about Claude Opus 4.6 and Anthropic's push toward more autonomous, enterprise-focused AI? Do you see real value in features like agent teams, 1M context, or deep integrations like PowerPoint? Would you trust an AI to handle complex work end-to-end with less human oversight, or do you still prefer tighter control? How do you think this compares to other frontier models you've used?

Interestingly enough, Anthropic, maker of Claude Code, is also releasing a new powerful model at exactly the same time. Anthropic's model, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/anthropic-claude-opus-4-6-first-try-work-deliverables/">Opus 4.6</a>, is a more general-purpose model, but Anthropic is well known for its <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/claude-code-alternative-free-local-open-source-goose-getting-started/">Claude Code</a> offering.</p><div><!----></div><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/anthropic-claude-opus-4-6-first-try-work-deliverables/">Anthropic says its new Claude Opus 4.6 can nail your work deliverables on the first try</a></strong></p><p>As with Anthropic's Opus 4.6, OpenAI describes GPT-5.3 as a "frontier model." This is a term the AI industry uses to describe models at the bleeding edge of performance and capability. According to OpenAI, the new 5.3 Codex runs 25% faster, enabling longer-running tasks.</p><p>OpenAI's GPT-5.3-Codex is being announced just days after OpenAI's announcement and release of a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/openai-codex-mac-app-free-trial/">Mac app dedicated to Codex</a>.  </p><div><!----></div><p>Astute watchers of OpenAI's GPT models will notice the 5.3 version number on this release. OpenAI's current hottest GPT release is <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-plus-codex-to-debug-code/">GPT-5.2</a>, not GPT-5.3. Although nothing has been announced or even hinted at, I'm guessing we're not too far away from a general GPT-5.3 release in the next few days or weeks.  </p><div><!----></div><h2> 	Coding AI, code thyself  </h2><p>I'm not sure if this is incredibly exciting or deeply disturbing. GPT-5.3-Codex is OpenAI's "first model that was instrumental in creating itself." The Codex team used Codex to debug its own training, manage its own deployment, and diagnose test results.  </p><div><!----></div><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-got-4-years-of-product-development-done-in-4-days-for-200-and-im-still-stunned/">I got 4 years of product development done in 4 days for $200, and I'm still stunned</a></strong></p><p>OpenAI's blog post says, "With GPT-5.3-Codex, Codex goes from an agent that can write and review code to an agent that can do nearly anything developers and professionals can do on a computer." Let's just hope it doesn't decide that humans are superfluous.  </p><h2> 	More than just coding  </h2><p>Acknowledging that developers, designers, product managers, and data scientists do a lot more in their jobs than just code, GPT-5.3-Codex is designed to support "all of the work in the software lifecycle -- debugging, deploying, monitoring, writing PRDs, editing copy, user research, tests, metrics, and more." The company reports that it can help you build whatever you want to build, specifically mentioning building slide decks and spreadsheets.</p><div><!----></div><div><!----></div><p><strong>Also: </strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/local-ai-coding-stack-replaces-claude-code-codex-free/"><strong>Want local vibe coding? This AI stack replaces Claude Code and Codex - and it's free</strong></a></p><p>The company says that this model is designed to be steered mid-task, with continuous interaction and no loss of context. The new Codex Mac app (and, presumably, an upcoming Windows app) can definitely help in maintaining interaction with the model as it works on projects for you.  </p><div><!----></div><p>The span of operation is also much longer. Codex can run processes that take more than one day. As a test, OpenAI built two web-based games. Using the "skill" feature introduced with the Mac app, testers used a web gaming development skill to build the two games over millions of tokens.  </p><p>The blog post specifically highlighted how GPT-5.3-Codex better understands intent. If you're making a "day-to-day website," the blog post reports that "Simple or underspecified prompts now default to sites with more functionality and sensible defaults, giving you a stronger starting canvas to bring your ideas to life."  </p><div><!----></div><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/openai-codex-mac-app-free-trial/">OpenAI's Codex just got its own Mac app - and anyone can try it for free now</a></strong></p><div><!----></div><p>In other words, if you ask Codex to "make me something pretty," it will. I had some significant success asking Codex 5.2 to redesign some parts of my <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-plus-codex-to-debug-code/">WordPress security plugin</a> to make the administration screens more attractive and compelling. Some of the design features that existed in earlier Codex versions have been improved upon in this latest release.  </p><div><!----></div><p>Other examples cited by the blog include dynamic pricing displays and automated testimonial carousels.  </p><h2> 	Frontier benchmarks and technical performance  </h2><p>One of the subtexts I picked up in the technical briefing I participated in last week for the Mac Codex app was the desire on the part of some of its customers for faster response times. I know that I often set Codex or Claude Code off on a programming task and then switch to some other activity while waiting for the process to complete.  </p><div><!----></div><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/10-chatgpt-codex-secrets-i-only-learned-after-60-hours-of-pair-programming-with-it/">10 ChatGPT Codex secrets I only learned after 60 hours of pair programming with it</a></strong></p><p>While my experience has been that agentic coding speeds up my development process from months to days, that wait is still a bit painful. So increasing the performance, and thereby the output speed of the models, is always a win.  </p><div><!----></div><p>According to the blog post, "GPT-5.3-Codex sets a new industry high on SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal Bench." The company says assignments take fewer tokens, increasing efficiency. OpenAI also says, "GPT-5.3-Codex sets a new industry high on SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal Bench, and shows strong performance on OSWorld and GDPVal." These are benchmarks the company uses to measure coding, agentic operations, and real-world capabilities.  </p><div><!----></div><h2> 	Security, infrastructure, and safeguards  </h2><p>OpenAI has a published <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/18a02b5d-6b67-4cec-ab64-68cdfbddebcd/preparedness-framework-v2.pdf">Preparedness Framework</a>, which it uses for measuring and protecting against severe harm from frontier AI capabilities. In the blog post announcing GPT-5.3-Codex, the company says that this new model is the first one it classifies as "high capability" for cybersecurity tasks.  </p><p>It's been trained to identify software vulnerabilities, with expanded safeguards and monitoring. Concurrently, the company is launching Trusted Access for Cyber, a pilot program to accelerate cyber defense research, and is donating $10M in API credit grants to support cybersecurity research. If your organization is engaged in "good faith security research," you can apply for API credits through the company's <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-cybersecurity-grant-program/">Cybersecurity Grant Program</a>.  </p><div><!----></div><div><!----></div><p><strong>Also: </strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-chatgpt-plus-worth-it-free-go-pro-plans-compared/"><strong>Is ChatGPT Plus still worth your $20? I compared it to the Free, Go, and Pro plans - here's my advice</strong></a></p><p>Supporting these actions, the blog post reports, "We're taking a precautionary approach and deploying our most comprehensive cybersecurity safety stack to date. Our mitigations include dual-use safety training, automated monitoring, trusted access for advanced capabilities, and enforcement pipelines, including threat intelligence."  </p><div><!----></div><h2> 	Availability  </h2><p>GPT-5.3-Codex is available now with paid ChatGPT plans across the Codex app, CLI, IDE extension, and web. API access is planned, and the company expects to deliver 25% faster interactions. The Codex usage promotion we reported <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/openai-codex-mac-app-free-trial/">earlier this week for free ChatGPT users</a> still stands, but they'll be limited to GPT-5.2-Codex for now.  </p><p><strong>Also: </strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/stop-using-chatgpt-ai-models-i-use-instead/"><strong>Stop using ChatGPT for everything: My go-to AI models for research, coding, and more (and which I avoid)</strong></a></p><div><!----></div><p>What do you think about GPT-5.3-Codex and the direction OpenAI is taking with more autonomous, long-running coding agents? Have you tried Codex or similar tools like Claude Code in real development work? If so, did the speed or autonomy change how you work? How do you feel about an AI model helping debug, deploy, and even participate in its own development?

<p>Last year, Roblox <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/17/roblox-releases-its-open-source-model-that-can-create-3d-objects-using-ai/">launched</a> an open source AI model that could generate 3D objects on the platform, helping users quickly design digital items such as furniture, vehicles, and accessories. The company claims the tool, called Cube 3D, has so far helped users generate over 1.8 million 3D objects since it was rolled out last March.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the company <a href="https://about.roblox.com/newsroom/2026/02/accelerating-creation-powered-roblox-cube-foundation-model">launched the open beta </a>for its anticipated 4D creation feature that lets creators make not just static 3D models, but fully functional and interactive objects. The feature has been in <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/early-access-introducing-in-experience-4d-functional-objects-and-enhanced-3d-generation/4050893/1">early access</a> since November. </p>

<p>Roblox says 4D creation adds an important new layer: interactivity. With this technology, users can design items that can move and react to players in the game.</p>

<figure><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Roblox-4D-Creations.gif?w=680" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Roblox</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>​At launch, there are two types of object templates (called schemas) that creators can try out. </p>

<p>The first is the “Car-5” schema, which is used to create a car made of five separate parts: the main body and four wheels. Previously, cars were a single, solid 3D object that couldn’t move. The new system breaks down objects into parts and assigns behaviors to each so that they function individually within the virtual world. The AI therefore can generate cars with spinning wheels, making them more realistic and interactive. ​</p>

<p>The second is called “Body-1,” which can generate any object made from a single piece, like a simple box or sculpture.</p>

<p>The first experience with 4D generation is a game called <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/113627622022152/Wish-Master">Wish Master</a>, where players can generate cars they can drive, planes they can fly, and even dragons.</p>

<p>​In the future, Roblox plans to let creators make their own schemas so they’ll have more freedom to define how objects behave. The company says it is also developing new technology that could use a reference image to create a detailed 3D model that matches the image’s style (example below).</p>

<figure><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Upsample-3D-Models.png?w=680" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Roblox</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>The company says it is developing more ways to help people create games and experiences using AI, including a project it has dubbed “real-time dreaming.” Roblox CEO David Baszucki last month <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Rghjjk4h_kw">explained</a> that this project would let creators build new worlds using “keyboard navigation and sharing real-time text prompts.”</p>

<p>The open beta comes on the heels of Roblox’s recent implementation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/roblox-now-requires-all-users-globally-to-complete-age-checks-to-access-chat/">mandatory facial verification</a> for users to access chat features in the game, following lawsuits and investigations related to child safety.</p>

<p>If you’re brave enough to want to run the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/openclaw_security_problems/">demonstrably insecure</a> AI assistant OpenClaw, several clouds have already started offering it as a service.</p>
<p>OpenClaw, the name its developer Peter Steinberger settled on after changing from Clawdbot to Moltbot, is a platform for AI agents. Users can provide it with their credentials to various online services and prompt OpenClaw to operate them by issuing instructions in messaging apps like Telegram or WhatsApp. Steinberger says it “clears your inbox, sends emails, manages your calendar, checks you in for flights.”</p>
<p>Using OpenClaw’s AI features requires access to an AI model, either by connecting to an API or by running one locally. The latter possibility apparently sparked a rush to buy Apple’s $599 Mac Mini.</p>

<p>OpenClaw is new and largely untested – just the sort of workload that cloud operators have long said they excel at hosting so users can gather some experience before moving to production.</p>

<p>Clouds were therefore quick to develop OpenClaw-as-a-service oferings.</p>
<p>China’s Tencent Cloud was an early mover, last week <a href="https://www.tencentcloud.com/products/lighthouse">delivering</a> a one-click install tool for its <a href="https://www.tencentcloud.com/products/lighthouse">Lighthouse</a> service – an offering that allows users to deploy a small server and install an app or environment and run it for a few dollars a month.</p>

<p>DigitalOcean delivered a similar <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-run-openclaw">set of instructions</a> a couple of days later, and aimed them at its Droplets IaaS offering.</p>
<p>Alibaba Cloud launched its offering today and made it available in 19 regions, starting at $4/month, and using its simple application server – its equivalent of Lighthouse or Droplets. Interestingly, the Chinese giant says it will soon offer OpenClaw on its Elastic Compute Service – its full-fat IaaS equivalent to AWS EC2 – and on its Elastic Desktop Service, suggesting the chance to rent a cloudy PC to run an AI assistant.</p>
<h3>Kill it with fire</h3>
<p>Analyst firm Gartner has used uncharacteristically strong language to recommend against using OpenClaw.</p>
<p>In new advice titled “OpenClaw Agentic Productivity Comes With Unacceptable Cybersecurity Risk,” the firm describes the software as “a dangerous preview of agentic AI, demonstrating high utility but exposing enterprises to ‘insecure by default’ risks like plaintext credential storage.”</p>
<p>“Shadow deployment of OpenClaw creates single points of failure, as compromised hosts expose API keys, OAuth tokens, and sensitive conversations to attackers,” the firm adds, before recommending that businesses should immediately block OpenClaw downloads and traffic and stop traffic to the software.</p>

<p>Next, search for any users accessing OpenClaw and tell them to stop because using the software probably involves breaching security controls.</p>

</ul>
<p>If you must run it, Gartner recommends doing so only in isolated nonproduction virtual machines with throwaway credentials.</p>
<p>“It is not enterprise software. There is no promise of quality, no vendor support, no SLA… it ships without authentication enforced by default. It is not a SaaS product that you can manage via a corporate admin panel,” Gartner advises.</p>
<p>The firm also recommends rotating any credentials OpenClaw touches, as the AI tool’s use of plaintext storage and shabby security mean there’s a chance malefactors can use the login details for evil. So maybe don’t rush to use those cloudy OpenClaw services at work? Or anywhere? ®</p>                                <div>

It plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, can operate more reliably in larger codebases, and has better code review and debugging skills to catch its own mistakes. And, in a first for our Opus-class models, Opus 4.6 features a 1M token context window in beta.</p><p>Opus 4.6 can also apply its improved abilities to a range of everyday work tasks: running financial analyses, doing research, and using and creating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. Within <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview">Cowork</a>, where Claude can multitask autonomously, Opus 4.6 can put all these skills to work on your behalf.</p><p>The model’s performance is state-of-the-art on several evaluations. For example, it achieves the highest score on the agentic coding evaluation <a href="https://www.tbench.ai/news/announcement-2-0">Terminal-Bench 2.0</a> and leads all other frontier models on <a href="https://agi.safe.ai/">Humanity’s Last Exam</a>, a complex multidisciplinary reasoning test.

Opus 4.6 also performs better than any other model on <a href="https://openai.com/index/browsecomp/">BrowseComp</a>, which measures a model’s ability to locate hard-to-find information online.</p><p>As we show in our extensive <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-6-system-card">system card</a>, Opus 4.6 also shows an overall safety profile as good as, or better than, any other frontier model in the industry, with low rates of misaligned behavior across safety evaluations.</p><div><div><div><button><span>Knowledge work</span></button><button><span>Agentic search</span></button><button><span>Coding</span></button><button><span>Reasoning</span></button></div><div><div><figure><img alt="Bar charts comparing Claude Opus 4.6 to other models on GDPval-AA" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F6e29759b50e8b3a8363b38b1f573d854df968671-3840x2160.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Opus 4.6 is state-of-the-art on real-world work tasks across several professional domains.</figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><img alt="Bar chart comparing Opus 4.6 to other models on DeepSearchQA" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F018d6d882034d50727948b22e3ad3844a43ee09c-3840x2160.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Opus 4.6 gets the highest score in the industry for deep, multi-step agentic search.</figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><img alt="Bar charts comparing Opus 4.6 to other models on Terminal-Bench 2" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fb8cfd7ebd6c82febce5f428f519d68a5dcf5d16f-3840x2160.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Opus 4.6 excels at real-world agentic coding and system tasks.</figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><img src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fb8d511155f209c57e4d6a92ab115ebfc7c8832ff-3840x2160.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Opus 4.6 extends the frontier of expert-level reasoning.</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><p>In Claude Code, you can now assemble <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams"><em>agent teams</em></a> to work on tasks together.

Our engineers write code with Claude Code every day, and every new model first gets tested on our own work. With Opus 4.6, we’ve found that the model brings more focus to the most challenging parts of a task without being told to, moves quickly through the more straightforward parts, handles ambiguous problems with better judgment, and stays productive over longer sessions.</p><p></p><p>Opus 4.6 often thinks more deeply and more carefully revisits its reasoning before settling on an answer. This produces better results on harder problems, but can add cost and latency on simpler ones. If you’re finding that the model is overthinking on a given task, we recommend dialing effort down from its default setting (high) to medium. You can control this easily with the <code>/effort</code> <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort">parameter</a>.</p><p></p><p>Here are some of the things our Early Access partners told us about Claude Opus 4.6, including its propensity to work autonomously without hand-holding, its success where previous models failed, and its effect on how teams work:<br></p><div><div><div><div><div><div><img alt="Notion logo" src="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/images/4zrzovbb/website/7cfef6cd8ce2515a6abd52560ac4189f89f9ad35-116x40.svg"></div><div><svg><path></path></svg></div><blockquote><div>Claude Opus 4.6 is the strongest model Anthropic has shipped.

Opus 4.6 also shows the lowest rate of over-refusals—where the model fails to answer benign queries—of any recent Claude model.</p><div><figure><img alt="Bar charts comparing Opus 4.6 to other Claude models on overall misaligned behavior" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F569d748607388e6ed42e3ff0ff245d9b0cde6878-3840x2160.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>The overall misaligned behavior score for each recent Claude model on our automated behavioral audit (described in full in the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-6-system-card">Claude Opus 4.6 system card</a>).</figcaption></figure></div><p>For Claude Opus 4.6, we ran the most comprehensive set of safety evaluations of any model, applying many different tests for the first time and upgrading several that we’ve used before. We included new evaluations for user wellbeing, more complex tests of the model’s ability to refuse potentially dangerous requests, and updated evaluations of the model’s ability to surreptitiously perform harmful actions. We also experimented with new methods from <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/team/interpretability">interpretability</a>, the science of the inner workings of AI models, to begin to understand why the model behaves in certain ways—and, ultimately, to catch problems that standard testing might miss.</p><p></p><p>A detailed description of all capability and safety evaluations is available in the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-6-system-card">Claude Opus 4.6 system card</a>.</p><p></p><p>We’ve also applied new safeguards in areas where Opus 4.6 shows particular strengths that might be put to dangerous as well as beneficial uses. In particular, since the model shows enhanced cybersecurity abilities, we’ve developed six new cybersecurity <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/next-generation-constitutional-classifiers">probes</a>—methods of detecting harmful responses—to help us track different forms of potential misuse.</p><p>We’re also accelerating the cyber<em>defensive</em> uses of the model, using it to help find and patch vulnerabilities in open-source software (as we describe in our new <a href="https://red.anthropic.com/2026/zero-days/">cybersecurity blog post</a>). We think it’s critical that cyberdefenders use AI models like Claude to help level the playing field. Cybersecurity moves fast, and we’ll be adjusting and updating our safeguards as we learn more about potential threats; in the near future, we may institute real-time intervention to block abuse.</p><h2>Product and API updates</h2><p>We’ve made substantial updates across Claude, Claude Code, and the Claude Developer Platform to let Opus 4.6 perform at its best.</p><p></p><p><strong>Claude Developer Platform</strong></p><p>On the API, we’re giving developers better control over model effort and more flexibility for long-running agents. To do so, we’re introducing the following features:</p><ul><li><strong>Adaptive thinking.</strong> Previously, developers only had a binary choice between enabling or disabling extended thinking. Now, with <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking">adaptive thinking</a>, Claude can decide when deeper reasoning would be helpful. At the default effort level (high), the model uses extended thinking when useful, but developers can adjust the effort level to make it more or less selective.</li><li><strong>Effort. </strong>There are now four <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort">effort</a> levels to choose from: low, medium, high (default), and max. We encourage developers to experiment with different options to find what works best.</li><li><strong>Context compaction (beta).</strong> Long-running conversations and agentic tasks often hit the context window. <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/compaction">Context compaction</a> automatically summarizes and replaces older context when the conversation approaches a configurable threshold, letting Claude perform longer tasks without hitting limits.</li><li><strong>1M token context (beta).</strong> Opus 4.6 is our first Opus-class model with 1M token context. Premium pricing applies for prompts exceeding 200k tokens ($10/$37.50 per million input/output tokens).</li><li><strong>128k output tokens.</strong> Opus 4.6 supports outputs of up to 128k tokens, which lets Claude complete larger-output tasks without breaking them into multiple requests.</li><li><strong>US-only inference. </strong>For workloads that need to run in the United States, <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/data-residency">US-only inference</a> is available at 1.1× token pricing.</li></ul><p><strong>Product updates</strong></p><p>Across Claude and Claude Code, we’ve added features that allow knowledge workers and developers to tackle harder tasks with more of the tools they use every day.</p><p>We’ve introduced <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams">agent teams</a> in Claude Code as a research preview. You can now spin up multiple agents that work in parallel as a team and coordinate autonomously—best for tasks that split into independent, read-heavy work like codebase reviews. You can take over any subagent directly using Shift+Up/Down or <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a>.</p><p>Claude now also works better with the office tools you already use. Claude in Excel handles long-running and harder tasks with improved performance, and can plan before acting, ingest unstructured data and infer the right structure without guidance, and handle multi-step changes in one pass. Pair that with Claude in PowerPoint, and you can first process and structure your data in Excel, then bring it to life visually in PowerPoint. Claude reads your layouts, fonts, and slide masters to stay on brand, whether you’re building from a template or generating a full deck from a description. Claude in PowerPoint is now available in research preview for Max, Team, and Enterprise plans.</p></div>

The top end of that forecast would be more than double its 2025 spend. The company said in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/alphabet-google-q3-earnings.html">October</a> that it expected "a significant increase" to capex in 2026.</p><p>The company's capex spend will go toward investing in AI compute capacity for Google DeepMind and to meet "significant cloud customer demand as well as strategic investments in other bets," Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi told analysts on a call Wednesday. She added that it would be used to "improve the user experience and drive higher advertiser ROI in Google services."</p><p>The company saw revenue increase almost 18% year over year.

Google's Cloud unit houses most of the company's AI services and products.</p><p>That business's backlog increased 55% sequentially and more than doubled year over year, reaching $240 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, said Ashkenazi.</p><p>Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the call Wednesday that its Gemini AI app now has more than 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million monthly active users last quarter.</p><p>"As we scale, we are getting dramatically more efficient," Pichai said. "We were able to lower Gemini serving unit costs by 78% over 2025 through model optimizations, efficiency and utilization improvements."</p><p>Other Bets, which includes the company's life sciences unit Verily and self-driving car unit Waymo, reported revenue of $370 million during the quarter, down 7.5% from a year ago. Alphabet reported Other Bets' loss of $3.61 billion, a year-over-year increase of more than 200%.</p><p>Waymo took a $2.1 billion stock-based compensation charge for the quarter, as it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/02/waymo-announced-16-billion-fundraising-round.html">raised</a> a new funding round at a $16 billion valuation.

	<a href="https://variety.com/t/youtube/">YouTube</a> generated more than $60 billion in revenue for 2025, including both advertising and subscriptions, the first time parent company Alphabet has broken out total revenue for the platform.</p>



<p>
	That makes YouTube much larger than subscription-streaming leader Netflix, which reported $45.18 billion in revenue for full-year 2025. Indeed, the top-line number for YouTube was more than any other entertainment company except Disney ($95.7 billion in revenue for calendar year 2025).

	Meanwhile, YouTube also notched its biggest-ever ad sales number to date for the fourth quarter of 2025. However, that ad haul came in below Wall Street forecasts.</p>



<p>
	In the last three months of the year, YouTube’s global ad revenue totaled $11.38 billion, a year-over-year increase of 8.7%, parent company Alphabet reported. Wall Street analysts on average forecast YouTube ad revenue coming in at $11.84 billion, per StreetAccount. On the brand advertising front, YouTube saw lower political ad spending in the most recent quarter compared with Q4 2024.</p>



<p>
	According to Pichai, the NFL saw its highest paid-subscriber total for the Sunday Ticket out-of-market package available through YouTube for the most recent season (but he didn’t say what that number was). In October 2025, viewers watched more than 700 million hours of podcasts on YouTube on TVs, up 70% year over year, he said.

	Overall, Alphabet, also the parent of Google, posted Q4 revenue of $113.8 billion (up 18%) and net income of $34.5 billion (up 30%), or $2.82 per share. That handily topped analyst consensus estimates for $111.43 billion revenue and EPS of $2.63.</p>



<p>
	Alphabet is seeing its AI investments and infrastructure “drive revenue and growth across the board,” according to Pichai. He said that to “meet customer demand and capitalize on the growing opportunities we have ahead of us,” the company expects capital expenses to be $175 billion to $185 billion for 2026, which would be as much as double the $91.4 billion in capex for 2025.</p>



<p>
	During the quarter, YouTube inked a deal with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/oscars-youtube-2029-1236610989/">exclusive global rights to the Oscars</a> awards ceremony beginning in 2029 and running through 2033, nabbing the media rights from ABC. Last month the <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/global/bbc-confirms-landmark-youtube-deal-1236636483/">BBC announced a partnership with YouTube</a> under which the U.K. broadcaster will produce original content for the platform and launch new YouTube channels aimed at children and young adults.</p>



<p>
	YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, in his 2026 letter to the community outlining the platform’s priorities for the year, touted new AI tools coming for creators and said <a href="https://variety.com/2026/digital/news/youtube-channels-using-ai-tools-reduce-slop-neal-mohan-letter-1236636548/">more than 1 million channels used YouTube’s AI tools daily</a> in December 2025. At the same time, the rise of artificial intelligence has raised concerns about “AI slop,” he said, and YouTube is working on “reducing the spread of low-quality, repetitive content.”</p>



<p>
	YouTube Shorts, the platform’s short-form video format, now averages 200 billion daily views, according to Mohan. This year, YouTube will integrate different formats, like image posts, directly into the Shorts feed. In addition, YouTube TV will soon launch a “fully customizable multiview” feature, letting users watch several live channels on one screen, and will roll out <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/youtube-tv-plans-genre-specific-cheaper-sports-espn-unlimited-1236605324/">at least 10 lower-cost, genre-specific YouTube TV plans spanning sports, entertainment and news</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Snap shares rose over 2% after beating fourth-quarter revenue expectations with $1.72 billion and announcing a $500 million stock buyback. Despite a significant 400% increase in year-over-year net income and strong subscription growth for Snapchat+, the company missed daily active user estimates and issued conservative first-quarter revenue guidance. CEO Evan Spiegel addressed regulatory challenges and announced the formation of Specs Inc., a subsidiary focused on the development and marketing of upcoming augmented reality glasses.</p>

        <div><p><span><a href="/quotes/SNAP/">Snap</a><span><span><button><span></span></button></span></span></span> shares were up over 2% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the Snapchat parent released fourth-quarter earnings that beat on sales. </p><p>The company also announced a $500 million stock repurchase program.</p><div></div><p>Here is how the company did compared with Wall Street's expectations:</p><ul><li><strong>Earnings per share</strong>: 3 cents. That figure is not comparable to analysts' estimates.</li><li><strong>Revenue</strong>: $1.72 billion vs. $1.70 billion expected, according to LSEG </li><li><strong>Global daily active users</strong>: 474 million vs. 478 million expected, according to StreetAccount</li><li><strong>Global average revenue per user (ARPU)</strong>: $3.62 vs. $3.56 expected, according to StreetAccount</li></ul><p>The social media company said first-quarter revenue will be in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.53 billion, which is below analyst estimates of $1.55 billion. </p><p>Sales in Snap's fourth quarter rose 10% year over year, while net income was $45.2 million, which was up nearly 400% from the $9.1 million it reported a year ago.</p><p>Snap said that fourth-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, was $358 million, topping the $300 million that StreetAccount was projecting.</p><p>The company also said that its adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter will be between $170 million and $190 million. That midpoint is higher than StreetAccount's estimates of $178 million.</p><div></div><p>Snap's fourth-quarter global DAU dropped by 3 million quarter-over-quarter, which the company attributed to a reduction in marketing spending "in order to focus on more profitable growth," according to a letter to investors.</p><p>Additionally, Snap said that due to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/australia-plans-to-ban-social-media-for-under-16s-experts-call-it-a-momentous-step.html">Australia's social media minimum age act,</a> the company "implemented platform-level age verification" in that country during the fourth quarter that resulted "in the removal of approximately 400,000 accounts."</p><p>The company said that DAU for the North American region was 94 million, lower than the 97 million that Wall Street was projecting. <br><br>Snap shares dipped slightly in after-hours trading when an analyst asked the company's executives during an earnings call about potential regulatory challenges. <br><br>"Obviously, there's quite a bit working its way to the court system right now that would further restrict the use of Snapchat for our community," Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said during the earnings call about the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/27/tiktok-settlement-social-media-addiction-meta-youtube.html">regulatory environment</a>. Still, he said, the company's global ad sales stemming from users under the age of 18 is "not material."<br><br>"Looking at the revenue-generating potential of the business looking forward, we're not overly concerned about the changing regulatory environment," Spiegel said.</p><p>In the letter, Snap said it plans to focus on growing its subscription-related offerings, like Snapchat+ and the recently debuted Memories Storage Plans. The company said overall subscribers to those services grew 71% year over year to 24 million in the fourth quarter.</p><p>"Certainly memory storage plans were a big driver of the subscriber growth that we've seen recently," Spiegel said.</p><p>Last week, Snap announced that it had created a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/snap-establishes-specs-subsidiary-for-its-ar-glasses.html">wholly owned subsidiary named Specs Inc.</a> that will develop and market the company's augmented reality glasses. </p><p>"We're super excited about what's ahead this year with the launch of Specs, and obviously graduating from the R&amp;D phase of Specs to broader consumer adoption," Spiegel said about the company's <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/snap-specs-smart-glasses-ar.html">upcoming AR glasses</a> slated to debut in 2026.</p><p>Because the company's AR glasses "appeals to a different audience segment than the core Snapchat audience," Spiegel said, it's "going to be really important for us to develop a standalone brand identity for Specs."</p><p>Spiegel said that while "there may be opportunities to raise additional capital" for the company's AR glasses-related efforts in the future, Snap will need to be "balancing" the outside investment with its "own ownership interest and any potential dilution."</p><p><strong>WATCH</strong>: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/10/28/snap-ceo-evan-spiegel-metas-glasses-are-what-we-built-10-years-ago.html">Snap CEO Evan Spiegel on AR glasses</a>.</p></div>

        <hr/>
        <div><p><span><a href="/quotes/PINS/">Pinterest</a><span><span><button><span></span></button></span></span></span> CEO Bill Ready rebuked staffers who created an internal tool to track layoffs at the company, and fired those involved. </p><p>"Healthy debate and dissent are expected, that's how we make our decisions," Ready said at a companywide meeting last week, according to audio obtained by CNBC. "But there's a clear line between constructive debate and behavior that's obstructionist." </p><div></div><p>Pinterest <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/27/pinterest-layoffs-stock-ai.html">announced</a> on Jan. 27 that it would lay off less than 15% of its workforce and cut back on office space as part of a broader restructuring aimed at directing resources toward artificial intelligence projects. The company said it expects the layoffs will be complete by the end of September.</p><p>Following the announcement, Pinterest's technology chief addressed the layoffs in a meeting. Some employees asked which teams were impacted and whether more job cuts were coming, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the meeting was private. </p><p>Several Pinterest engineers then created an internal software tool to try and quantify the layoffs. Pinterest fired the engineers on Friday, the person said. It's unclear how many employees were let go. </p><p>Ready defended the moves at an all-hands meeting on Friday, saying Pinterest was facing a "critical moment" in the industry. Employees should consider a job elsewhere if they're "working against the direction of the company" and disagree with its mission, he said. </p><p>Ready said Pinterest wouldn't disclose detailed information about the layoffs out of a concern for staffers' privacy.</p><div></div><p>"I know people have natural curiosity around these things," Ready said. "We shared some of those major structural changes. The smaller ones, those will be communicated at the team level." </p><p>A Pinterest spokesperson confirmed the engineer incident and town hall meeting, but declined to comment on the firings.</p><p>"After being clearly informed that Pinterest would not broadly share information identifying impacted employees, two engineers wrote custom scripts improperly accessing confidential company information to identify the locations and names of all dismissed employees and then shared it more broadly," the spokesperson said. "This was a clear violation of Pinterest policy and of their former colleagues' privacy."</p><p>After this article was published, several Pinterest employees contacted CNBC and disputed the company's characterization of the incident. </p><p>Pinterest fired the engineers after they posted instructions showing how to prompt the company's staff directory to show who was laid off, the employees said. The employees said Pinterest's claim that the engineers created custom software was inaccurate, and said the directory tool is accessible to anyone in the company.</p><p>Pinterest has been investing heavily in AI to surface more personalized and relevant content, and to keep users returning to its platform. It's also rolled out automated tools for marketers in an effort to better compete with digital ad leaders <span><a href="/quotes/META/">Meta</a><span><span><button><span></span></button></span></span></span> and <span><a href="/quotes/GOOGL/">Google</a><span><span><button><span></span></button></span></span></span>. </p><p>Investors have <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/pinterests-ai-strategy-focuses-users-want?rc=wf4boz">raised concerns</a> around whether the increasing popularity of consumer chatbots from OpenAI, Google and others could steal users and ad dollars away from Pinterest. There's particular consternation around the use of AI agents for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/24/amazon-faces-a-dilemma-fight-ai-shopping-agents-or-join-them.html">shopping</a>, "which compresses the market of discovery and purchase on competing platforms," Wedbush analysts wrote in a research note last week.</p><p>Pinterest shares are down 20% so far this year after dropping 11% in 2025. </p><p>"We can't tolerate from each other obstructionism, especially when we have a mission that is so meaningful but also where the odds are stacked against us," Ready said. "We think we can beat those odds, but as a small purpose driven player competing against the largest companies in the history of the world, the only way that we succeed is if we work together, constructively, with clarity and focus."</p><p>More recently, Pinterest's <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/04/pinterest-pins-q3-earnings-report-2025.html">advertising sales slowed</a> as some large U.S. retailers weathered the impact of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/">President Donald Trump's</a> tariff policies.  </p><p>Tech companies have continued to downsize this year as they look for more ways to increase efficiencies and invest in AI. <span><a href="/quotes/AMZN/">Amazon</a><span><span><button><span></span></button></span></span></span> last week said it would <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/amazon-layoffs-anti-bureaucracy-ai.html">lay off</a> about 16,000 corporate employees, after it let go 14,000 staffers in October.

<p>Newsletter platform Substack is notifying users of a data breach after attackers stole their email addresses and phone numbers in October 2025.</p>


<p>Although the incident occurred four months ago, CEO Chris Best told affected users that Substack only discovered the breach this week. However, while the attackers stole some users' data, Best added that they didn't access credentials or financial information.</p>


<p>"On February 3rd, we identified evidence of a problem with our systems that allowed an unauthorized third party to access limited user data without permission, including email addresses, phone numbers, and other internal metadata," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/newsguy.bsky.social/post/3me3dhsexmt2s">Best said</a> in breach notification emails sent today.</p>

 <a href="https://www.wiz.io/lp/secure-images-101-a-visual-guide?utm_source=bleepingcomputer&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=FY26Q4_INB_FORM_Hardened-Images-101-Digital-Poster&amp;sfcid=701Py00000WFCeLIAX&amp;utm_term=FY27-bleepingcomputer-article-970x250&amp;utm_content=Secured-Images-101"><img src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/c/w/Secured-Images-970x250.png" alt="Wiz"></a>
</div>


<p>"This data was accessed in October 2025. Importantly, credit card numbers, passwords, and financial information were not accessed."</p>


<p>Although Substack has yet to share how many users were affected by the incident, on Monday, a threat actor leaked a database on the BreachForums hacking forum containing 697,313 records of allegedly stolen data.</p>


<p>They also claim to have scraped the data and noted that "the scraping method used was noisy and patched fast."</p>

<p>While it didn't explain how the attacker gained access to the stolen data or reveal the full impact of the data breach, Substack says it has addressed the flaw exploited in the attack and warned of potential phishing attempts that could exploit the stolen information.</p>


<p>"We have fixed the problem with our system that allowed this to happen," Best added. "We do not have evidence that this information is being misused, but we encourage you to take extra caution with any emails or text messages you receive that may be suspicious."</p>


<p>A Substack spokesperson didn't share further details regarding the incident when BleepingComputer reached out, but said that "safeguards have been put in place to help prevent this issue from happening again."</p>


<p>Almost six years ago, in July 2020, Substack accidentally <a href="https://x.com/Substack/status/1288283848220893185">exposed some users' email addresses</a> in a privacy policy update email by including them in the 'to' line instead of the 'bcc' field.</p>


<p>Since its launch in 2017, Substack has gained popularity among independent journalists and content creators, reaching five million paid subscriptions by March 2025.</p>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt; Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market are experiencing a significant crash, with Bitcoin falling below $68,000 and erasing over a year of gains. Major assets like Solana and Ether have also hit multi-year lows, driven by institutional sell-offs and liquidations from entities such as the Trump-owned World Liberty Financial.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Bitcoin and other altcoins began <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bitcoin-price-plunge-crypto-falls-jan-29"><u>experiencing</u></a> a noticeable <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-prices-continue-to-drop-jan-30"><u>downturn</u></a> in the market late last week. Crypto analysts provided key market levels for Bitcoin to hold in order to avoid the worst. Some analysts said holding at $80,000 would be key while others said $70,000. Falling below those levels, analysts said, could drive further decline as investors look to sell off their holdings. </p><section>

<p>Bitcoin has now fallen below both key levels. Now, some analysts are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/bitcoin-price-today-70000-in-focus.html" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>saying</u></a> that Bitcoin could land in the $60,000 to $65,000 range while others are forecasting potential further drops landing the cryptocurrency at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2026/02/02/bitcoin-could-plunge-all-the-way-to-40k--zacks-john-blank.html?" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>$40,000</u></a>.</p><p>The downturn isn't unique to crypto, as stocks especially in the tech sector are currently dropping, but cryptocurrency is experiencing the worst of it. As a highly volatile and still largely unproven asset class, crypto is among the first investments to go in a sell-off from institutional investors.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/Cointelegraph/status/2019330732645343739" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>report</u></a> from CryptoQuant, institutional firms that were buying up tens of thousands of Bitcoin just last year are now net sellers this year.</p><p>Social media users are noticing that other whales are also selling off, which further tanks the price of Bitcoin. World Liberty Financial, the crypto company owned by the Trump family, <a href="https://x.com/TedPillows/status/2019409661125095758" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>liquidated</u></a> more than $5 million of its Bitcoin holdings on Thursday. </p>

<p>Get ready for some selfies that are out of this world. NASA astronauts will be allowed to bring their smartphones to space for the first time, starting with the Crew-12 and Artemis II missions.</p>

<p>Crew-12 is expected to head to the International Space Station <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/commercialcrew/2026/01/28/nasas-spacex-crew-12-begins-quarantine-for-space-station-mission/">next week</a>, while the highly anticipated Artemis II mission — which will <a href="https://time.com/7346146/artemis-ii-launch-nasa-astronauts-moon-mission/">bring humans around the moon</a> for the first time since the 1960s — was delayed until March.</p>

<p>“We are giving our crews the tools to capture special moments for their families and share inspiring images and video with the world,” NASA administrator Jared Isaacman <a href="https://x.com/NASAAdmin/status/2019259382962307393">wrote</a> on X.</p>

<p>With the newest iPhones and Android devices at hand, the crew will be able to be a bit more spontaneous with image and video gathering, meaning that for those of us back home, these upcoming trips to space could end up being some of NASA’s most well-documented journeys yet.</p>

<p>Imagine how cool (or cringe-worthy) it will be if astronauts turn themselves into TikTok stars in zero gravity, or if they take ultra-wide-angle selfies in the spacecraft. For those working in government bureaucracy, it’s equally exciting, apparently, that NASA approved this rule change pretty quickly.</p>

<p>“Just as important, we challenged long-standing processes and qualified modern hardware for spaceflight on an expedited timeline,” Isaacman wrote. “That operational urgency will serve NASA well as we pursue the highest-value science and research in orbit and on the lunar surface.”</p>

<p>It makes sense that it would be hard to approve new technology to go into space — if one small thing goes astray, a spaceflight can go terribly wrong. Until now, the newest cameras that were supposed to go on these missions were decade-old Nikon DSLRs and GoPros, according to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-will-finally-allow-astronauts-to-bring-their-iphones-to-space/">Ars Technica</a>. That’s by no means arcane, but there’s something more spontaneous and whimsical about using a smartphone.</p>

                    <p>Apple just posted a <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/best-ever-iphone-sales-quarter-takes-apple-to-25-billion-active-devices">record quarter</a> with its highest-ever iPhone sales, but the company is now gearing up to launch its next phone, the iPhone 17e, on Feb. 19, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2881175/iphone-17e-release-date-specs-features-price.html" title="(Opens in a new tab)">Macworld reports</a>.</p><p>The date falls on a Thursday, which is not a day Apple usually reserves for hardware launches. It is, however, the same date the <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-iphone-16e">iPhone 16e</a> debuted. Like last year, Apple may avoid an event to announce the phone and instead unveil it through a press release, the report adds.</p><p>The iPhone 16e resembles the <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-iphone-14">iPhone 14</a>, and it replaced the budget SE model in the iPhone lineup. The phone comes with a 6.1-inch OLED display, the A18 processor, support for <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/is-apple-intelligence-actually-smart-i-tested-every-feature-to-find-out">Apple Intelligence</a>, a single 48MP rear camera, and the C1 modem. </p><div>

<p>The iPhone 17e is expected to retain the 16e’s design, while receiving four major internal upgrades. According to Japanese blog <a href="https://www.macotakara.jp/rumor/entry-50451.html" title="(Opens in a new tab)">Mac Otakara</a>, it will use the A19 chip from <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-iphone-17?test_uuid=04IpBmWGZleS0I0J3epvMrC&amp;test_variant=B">iPhone 17</a> for faster performance and improved power efficiency, and will be equipped with Apple’s C1X modem for 5G and LTE connectivity and the N1 chip for <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/wi-fi-7-explained-finally-speed-thats-worth-a-router-upgrade">Wi-Fi 7</a> and Bluetooth 6 connectivity. </p><p>Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2025/09/introducing-iphone-air-a-powerful-new-iphone-with-a-breakthrough-design" title="(Opens in a new tab)">says</a> C1X is two times <a href="https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2025/09/introducing-iphone-air-a-powerful-new-iphone-with-a-breakthrough-design" title="(Opens in a new tab)">faster</a> than the C1, and the N1 chip “improves the overall performance and reliability of features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop.”</p><div>

<p>MacWorld also reported that the iPhone 17e may support MagSafe.

The tablet is expected to receive the A18 chip and 8GB of RAM.

				<p><span>This year will be, without a doubt, the biggest year for Apple, not only because Apple will launch several exciting all-new products, but this year also marks the 50th anniversary, or semicentennial, of the company’s founding. Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, held an all-hands meeting with its employees earlier today, and this was what Cook teased for the employees, according to </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/apple-s-cook-vows-to-lobby-lawmakers-on-immigration-issue?embedded-checkout=true"><span>Mark Gurman</span></a><span>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“</span><span>I’ve been unusually reflective lately about Apple because we have been working on what to do to mark this moment. When you really stop and pause and think about the last 50 years, it makes your heart sing. It really does. I promise some celebration.” </span><span>-Tim Cook</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>With that kind of announcement, it certainly sounds like Apple is going to celebrate really big for the company’s upcoming anniversary. Apple was co-founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak on April 1, 1976, so it’s only less than two months until Apple celebrates its semicentennial.</span></p><div>

<p><span>We don’t know exactly what Apple is planning for its 50th anniversary, but I could imagine some sort of special-edition Apple product to commemorate its milestone. As a bit of trivia, Apple did offer the special-edition Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh to commemorate the company’s 20th anniversary despite being released in 1997; however, that computer simply crashed and burned due to how outrageously expensive it was. </span></p>

<p><span>However, I could imagine Apple holding a media press event to introduce several new products for the home. Apple held a media event in April 2021 to introduce the updated Apple TV 4K, the first AirTag, the M1 iPad Pro, and the colorful M1 iMac. If you think about it, these products were designed to be used around the home. So Apple could have another event this April again to introduce more home-related products; this would include the next generation Siri, the next Apple TV 4K, the refreshed HomePod mini, the budget MacBook, and the long-rumored “HomePad” device.</span></p>
<p><span>For what it’s worth, these next few months will be very exciting for all Apple enthusiasts, so we will surely cover everything that Apple has up its sleeves. Make sure you bookmark this site to stay updated with the latest content from us!</span></p>

                                        <p>LONDON (AP) — The European Union on Friday accused TikTok of breaching the bloc’s digital rules with “addictive design” features that lead to compulsive use by children, in preliminary charges that strike at the heart of the popular video sharing app’s operating model. </p><p>EU regulators said their two-year <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/european-union-tiktok-digital-regulation-3fd249bbc9ff78a4401827c4b84b71a7">investigation</a></span> found that TikTok hasn’t done enough to assess how features such as autoplay and infinite scroll could harm the physical and mental health of users, including minors and “vulnerable adults.” </p><p>The European Commission said it believes TikTok should change the “basic design” of its service. The commission is the EU’s executive arm and enforcer of the 27-nation bloc’s <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/eu-european-union-digital-services-act-4fc60b69253bcbbf9f46a84cbd93bdaf">Digital Services Act</a></span>, a sweeping rulebook that requires social media companies to clean up their platforms and protect users, under threat of hefty fines.</p><p>TikTok denied the accusations. </p>

<p>TikTok’s features including infinite scrolling, autoplay, push notifications, and highly personalized recommender systems “lead to the compulsive use of the app, especially for our kids, and this poses major risks to their mental health and wellbeing,” Commission spokesman Thomas Regnier said at a press briefing in Brussels. </p>

<p>“The measures that TikTok has in place are simply not enough,” he said. </p><p>The company now has a chance to defend itself and reply to the commission’s findings. Regnier said “if they don’t do this properly,” Brussels could issue a so-called non-compliance decision and possible fine worth up to 6% of the company’s total annual revenue. There was no deadline specified for the commission to make a final decision.</p>

        <div><div><p>An elixir for keeping our brains and bodies younger may already be sitting on pharmacy shelves across the United States — if only we’d take advantage of it.</p></div><div><p>I’m talking about the shingles vaccine.</p></div><div><p>It was invented because, well, <a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/diseases/shingles-herpes-zoster?">shingles</a> is a terrible disease. If you ever had chickenpox (like I did), this virus is lurking inside your body already. Shingles is the reactivation of the same varicella zoster virus later in life. It can lead to painful red rashes that last for weeks, and for some people, they will suffer from debilitating nerve pain for the rest of their lives.</p></div><div><p>The debut of <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa051016?">the first shingles shot in 2006</a> was a big public health win for that reason alone. But the benefits may be even greater than we realized at the time.</p></div><div><div><div></div><div><div><h2>Sign up for the Good Medicine newsletter</h2></div></div><div><p>Our political wellness landscape has shifted: new leaders, shady science, contradictory advice, broken trust, and overwhelming systems. How is anyone supposed to make sense of it all? Vox’s senior correspondent <a href="/authors/dylan-scott">Dylan Scott</a> has been on the health beat for more than a decade, and every week, he’ll wade into sticky debates, answer fair questions, and contextualize what’s happening in American health care policy. Sign up <a href="/pages/good-medicine-newsletter-signup">here</a>.</p></div></div></div><div><p>Over the past year, there has been a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x">steady</a> <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422%2825%2900455-7/fulltext">stream</a> of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/gerona/glag008/8430804?utm_source=chatgpt.com&amp;login=false#google_vignette">studies</a> <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833335?">showing</a> that the shingles vaccine doesn’t just stop the painful skin rashes — it could also stave off dementia and slow our biological aging.</p></div><div><p>A recent study that tracked specific biomarkers in human samples strengthened the case that there is a genuine cause-and-effect. The science surrounding the shingles vaccine is a new window into <em>how </em>we age and how we might even slow it down. These findings could open doors to powerful new anti-aging, anti-dementia treatments.</p></div><div><p>But that will require more investment — and researchers working on these projects told me it’s been surprisingly hard to find the necessary financial support. Just as importantly, we need to get more seniors to take the vaccine: As of now, less than a third of eligible Americans over 50 are getting their shingles jab.</p></div><div><div><h2>The remarkable anti-aging shingles shot</h2></div></div><div><p>The first shingles vaccine, released in 2006, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa051016?">decreased</a> the risk of shingles by 60 percent and also reduced by two-thirds the risk of long-term nerve pain. Experts said at the time that the shot “represents a major public health advance.”</p></div><div><p>But it was only within the last year that the awesome dementia-defeating powers of the shingles vaccine started to come into focus.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/pascal-geldsetzer">Pascal Geldsetzer</a>, who researches population health at Stanford University, spotted an opportunity: In 2013, Wales had established new standards for who could receive the shingles vaccine. People who were born before September 2, 1933, were not eligible, and everyone born on that day or after was. There were two large groups of people who were otherwise the same, differing in age by only weeks, except one of them had received the shingles shot and the other had not. It’s about as rigorous a “natural experiment” as you could hope for. And so a few years ago, Geldsetzer and his co-authors looked back at the country’s comprehensive health records to track what had happened to patients after they received a shingles vaccine (or didn’t).</p></div><div><p>And the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x">results</a>, published in April 2025, were striking: Receiving the shingles vaccine was associated with a 20 percent lower chance of being diagnosed with dementia. Those findings held up to all kinds of veracity checks — and they were repeated in similar natural experiments in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833335?">Australia</a> and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(25)00455-7/fulltext">Canada</a> (the latter also co-authored by Geldsetzer). A December 2025 study based on the same Welsh data <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01256-5">concluded</a> that people who already had dementia and received the shingles vaccine saw slower progression of the disease and fewer deaths, suggesting that the shot may be effective in treating dementia, too.</p></div><div><p>So the circumstantial case for the shingles shot has grown robust — and now we’re starting to get lab-based research that could explain why this is happening.</p></div><div><p>A recent <a href="https://watermark02.silverchair.com/glag008.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAA4QwggOABgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggNxMIIDbQIBADCCA2YGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMlkvgFudtZB_CQhnuAgEQgIIDNwTZ7VFCih6RTtkdKctqzMdg9GS8LfinuIl16gXmEmUgy8BoyFukJQ58mUtBcop6dEi68L_QvrZDOOIZxVAhlu1jNz1ocezCe1goRYHWYumBgmQcRcEGb-fu7aSl5Cfm4HmNJrL4tJkhk0BSCV9J9ub6KGaZ6y4AeUSS1aQycdgMePH3LmhY3X5-lWVhwKjTbsDB3diyHVAbN1XrufyblUm3FlVsfjh3Vo1-8UN7nXtf3AdNpbcR1500Fwgn_uDPe-x8jYsAAhVAhmdtl9GhC2xoaaTzZ4CMNiVdBOkJhLvcH67mbKSSb6vsElrnil7ClzJvgfo_ODJkpeYY1LjAGePi9Me_FGHa47FWwSdafnwwkjQVWRIIwNNzwkhiPJOHcUkJLL2G0Xn7K_E_-1A8iPz-59z9U1RCDXMi-UW8CB3Jr_eDPoBtFW0fVTZOFeFMIE7RLuUQhkZc6cRPa5WBLCbzADgFZWe2wACJbuIAFEQ7ZaXq-afIA6fQxKsdZ3CyZpOelxuhAok-Y3r7JzPDOmkXV9YkL-vPAooT1wOhAezeZvR8hTTXwnUcxz4_PNRNqDGq828Mbdgw832C0CCtJowDeZAkqlkler9OUXX0pUJdcQ4ITWiOPL73hli8PlCGYsredZ8ujfPR4789MC1NlZUH52H3amVakAvhc7SvJbOVhPOjH_0eqpWmYDpxnE87w6NbG8-z2U_PLj-bEMwI6WtR-c-bXP1zlkLCOyXfh5C4rcK_syfaapkxpSMkFrPrQQ65xGQGLA0Gi-PMFa4-LWeDfVEtnxrVGSe8WgHDzsrceRfb8Nhw5p2syOZMXgenyV_iIXymW-QGMAZG0gjd5RvlF9jSmEvOGPcmUaQwEhXMLUNqorsAIdPpZKaicv_3C5pHFNHMtsiQPSoQ0Gs5P1lBAxAQXp8AdIe9jqychTOrQWDJNFywSK2vebRfblv7cOzB4qwXX1SXW1anJbmZsyAjl0i0Z5l7Qjqxh5G1dJq5fF2uLdWkkZ_DdmW-gkAVYykWMBPaTiCDpwD4zpJYo8_TCXZkTKFqKLRnAdars2fqLNSaQ8YKoRQpKdtDkzeUqHQan2rMqHQ">study</a> analyzed biomarker data from blood samples collected by the US government as part of regular surveys monitoring Americans’ health. Whereas the earlier studies were observational, this was an attempt by scientists to actually see what was happening — to measure changes in the body at the molecular level. The researchers found that the vaccine was associated with slower overall biological aging, lower inflammation, and less cell damage. The findings fit with what we’re learning about <a href="/health/474384/what-is-inflammation-causes-how-to-reduce-diet">how chronic inflammation may slowly damage the body</a> over time, leading to various chronic health problems.</p></div><div><p>The study did leave one mystery: The biomarkers specifically linked to dementia did not actually decrease. But the authors noted that we’re still figuring out how to understand the relationship between brain biomarkers and disease. It is possible, for example, that less systemic inflammation leads to less dementia without specifically altering the biomarkers that were tracked.</p></div><div><div><h2>But now money is drying up for vaccine research</h2></div></div><div><p>The existing research largely focuses on the initial vaccine released. But in 2018, an even better version came on the market.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.shingrix.com/about/discover-shingles/">Shingrix</a>, which combined virus proteins with an immunity booster, prevented shingles in more than 90 percent of cases in clinical trials, with similar success in preventing nerve damage. It is now the standard vaccine in the US.</p></div><div><p>But does Shingrix have the same anti-aging effects? Unfortunately, we just don’t know. We need more research — and that’s where all this promising news runs into a brick wall.</p></div><div><p>Ideally, researchers would run randomized clinical trials. But despite these amazing findings, Geldsetzer told me he had been struggling to find financial support to study Shingrix.</p></div><div><div><form><div><div><h2>Good Medicine</h2><p><span>A newsletter for anyone trying to make sense of their health.</span></p></div><div><fieldset><div><div><div><label>Email (required)</label><div><input></div></div></div><button><span>Sign Up</span></button></div></fieldset><div><div>By submitting your email, you agree to our<!-- --> <a href="https://www.voxmedia.com/legal/terms-of-use">Terms</a> and <a href="https://www.voxmedia.com/legal/privacy-notice">Privacy Notice</a>. <!-- -->This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google<!-- --> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> <!-- -->apply.</div></div></div></div></form></div></div><div><p>“I think to really convince the public health and medical community what we need now is a true clinical trial, a randomized trial on the effect of shingles vaccination for dementia prevention and cognition,” Geldsetzer said. “There’s little commercial interest. It’s not been easy at all.”</p></div><div><p>A number of things are working against him and his peers. The initial Welsh research was supported by an NIH grant, but pro-vaccine research <a href="/health/471362/rfk-jr-vaccine-committee-hepatitis-b-shot">does not exactly align with the administration’s priorities</a> under US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s leadership. Drug manufacturers have also been pulling out of the vaccine business <a href="https://epar.evans.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/EPAR_UW_345_Private-Sector-GH-RD_Executive-Summary_0-1.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">for years</a>, a trend that is <a href="https://www.biospace.com/drug-development/sanofi-moves-away-from-mrna-flu-vaccine-as-ceo-projects-confidence">getting worse</a> under the Trump administration.</p></div><div><p>There is a bitter irony here.</p></div><div><p>The shingles vaccine was <a href="http://as01">made possible</a> because pharmaceutical companies, philanthropy groups, and national governments invested in a new vaccine platform while searching for a malaria shot, just one of many examples of how scientific investment can pay off in unexpected ways. But now, money is short.</p></div><div><div><h2>Let’s not miss this tremendous health care opportunity</h2></div></div><div><p>To maximize the shingles vaccine’s value, we need more research, <em>and</em> we need more people to take it. Vaccination rates are still surprisingly low: Only 30 percent of eligible patients <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264410X2500800X#xd_co_f=MWJiMmYxNGUtOTZkYy00MzFkLTg3MDctNDFjODRiZWM4YjNk~">received</a> the shingles shot as of 2022.</p></div><div><p>Lower vaccination rates among men, underrepresented and historically marginalized groups, and lower-income people <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12701292/">suggest</a> this is partly a health care access issue. (Adding to that evidence: People <em>without</em> chronic conditions are also less likely to get it, probably because they have less contact with the health system.)</p></div><div><p>But on top of that, we’re now entering a new era of vaccine hesitancy, even among older people. Vaccination rates among seniors for pneumonia and flu have been <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db547.pdf?ueid=f140c1c4af8bbecbdb57b9f78d0ce81d&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=GM%201.22&amp;utm_term=VoxCare">dropping</a>.</p></div><div><p>This is a big public health test: We seem to have a cheap intervention for aging and cognitive decline.</p></div><div><p>In a more pro-vaccine alternate reality, we might even be pondering questions like: Should even younger people get it? Shingles has grown <a href="https://www.adventisthealthcare.com/living-well/shingles-its-not-just-for-those-over-50/">increasingly common</a> among people in their 30s and 40s, and given the studies so far have found the shot’s anti-aging effects persist for years, the long-term payoff could be immense.</p></div><div><p>Those are the policy challenges. At the personal level, what each of us can do is talk to the seniors in our lives; a lot of them aren’t getting vaccinated. Shingles sucks — and the shot for it might also stave off dementia and slow your body’s aging. Win-win-win.</p></div><div><p></p></div><div><span>See More<!-- -->:<span> </span></span><ul><li><a href="/good-medicine-newsletter">Good Medicine</a></li><li><a href="/health">Health</a></li><li><a href="/health-care">Health Care</a></li><li><a href="/policy">Policy</a></li><li><a href="/public-health">Public Health</a></li><li><a href="/science">Science</a></li></ul></div></div>

In previous years, he was preceded by Kendrick Lamar, Usher, Rihanna, a group led by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, and the Weeknd. What do those artists have in common? Or, more accurately, what’s missing from that crew? The answer comes quickly to six-string slingers who can provide a detailed list of the differences between a Fender Stratocaster and Telecaster. In short: there’s no rock (unless we’re counting Rihanna’s “Shut Up And Drive”).</p>
<p>There was a time in the not-so-distant past when rock and roll dominated the Halftime Show. (I’m in my mid-30s, so even though TikTok is full of kids making yearning, nostalgia-bait videos about flip-phones and Littlest Pet Shop toys, the 2000s is my “not-so-distant” past.) The first half of the 2000s saw a lot of dual and even group headliners, although not many were themselves rock acts: Phil Collins, Christina Aguilera, and more in 2000; Aerosmith and NSYNC in 2001; Shania Twain and No Doubt in 2003; and a group led by Janet Jackson and a pre-arrest Diddy in 2004. </p>
<p>2005 marked the start of a clear pivot and the reason is obvious. Janet Jackson was part of the previous year’s show, but so was Justin Timberlake. It was the infamous “nipplegate” performance, where Timberlake tore off a piece of Jackson’s outfit and exposed her breast to millions of viewers on live television. The cultural implications of this moment were immense. Everybody from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080307122430/http://dir.salon.com/story/opinion/feature/2004/02/13/zell/index.html">Democratic senator Zell Miller</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040411114159/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20040204-0213-superbowl-jackson.html">Spike Lee</a> spoke out against the stunt. Timberlake introduced the term “wardrobe malfunction” into public consciousness while apologizing at the 2004 Grammys. YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim <a href="https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-10-11-youtube-karim_x.htm">later said</a> the idea for the internet video platform stemmed from the difficulty he faced finding videos of the 2004 Halftime Show (and of a tsunami in Asia from the same year) online.</p><!-- admarker --> <div><div></div></div><!-- inline --><!-- RevContent  <div id="revcontent-hidden"> -->  <!-- revisit -->
<p>Naturally, after that mess, the NFL had a clear desire to play it safe (musically, not with the CTE-inducing brutality of football) the following year. So, they went with Paul McCartney. “People may have concerns of another wardrobe malfunction, but I can safely tell you that I won’t,” the former Beatle <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4241069.stm">said</a> ahead of his performance, adding: “We will pretty much get up there and just use the time allotted to rock.” And that’s exactly what he did. He and his band ran through a four-song set of Beatles and Wings songs, with McCartney making good on his word to not show his silky Liverpudlian skin.</p>
<p>Continuing to exercise caution in 2006, the NFL got another classic and recognizable rock figure to play: The Rolling Stones. The league remained understandably sensitive, so much so that ABC <a href="https://www.today.com/id/wbna11193993">put the performance on a five-second tape delay</a> and censored a couple potentially objectionable lyrics: “You make a dead man come” from “Start Me Up” and “Once upon a time, I was your little rooster / Now am I just one of your cocks” from “Rough Justice.” A band representative later described the censorship as “ridiculous.” Outwardly, though, the performance was another Halftime Show without headline-level issues.</p><!-- admarker --> <div><div></div></div><!-- inline -->
<p>The NFL just kept busting out rocker after rocker from there. The run hit a high point with Prince in 2007, who delivered an epic, rain-drenched performance that is now considered one of the greatest Halftime Shows ever. Rock was clearly working, so that’s where the NFL’s head remained in 2008. The league reportedly had its sights set on Bruce Springsteen, which failed to pan out, then the Eagles <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/eagles-turn-down-super-bowl-prefer-grand-ole-opry-84247/">turned down the gig</a>, so it ended up going to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Springsteen and his E Street Band performed in 2009, breaking down and saying yes after first being asked to play the big game as early as 1975. (Continuing to ask after 30-plus years of rejection should be considered harassment, but I digress.)</p>
<p>By 2010, the NFL was firmly in its classic rock era when they tapped the Who, who had a farewell tour in 1982 but still performed here and there. <em>Rolling Stone</em> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/fans-react-to-the-whos-super-bowl-halftime-performance-113025/">rounded up online comments</a> about the show shortly after it aired: alas, reception was mixed. Most of the positivity seemed to come from the band’s devoted, likely older fans (“I’ve seen them 28 times over the last 25 years and last night at the ripe age of 65 and 64 they were unreal”), while others had more measured takes (“The Who were an amazing band, but you gotta face the fact that they really didn’t sound good”). Retrospectively, the publication’s Rob Sheffield <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/super-bowl-halftime-shows-ranked-from-worst-to-best-14201/the-who-2010-129966/">ranked</a> every Halftime Show in 2024 and the Who was in the bottom portion of the list: “They showed up even more shoddily prepared than the Colts, fumbling a medley of classics—sad to think of all the kids out there first hearing ‘Won’t Get Fooled Again’ or ‘Baba O’Riley’ in this sorry condition.”</p><!-- admarker --> <div><div></div></div><!-- inline -->
<p>Critics were surely relieved when the Halftime Show was under new management in 2011, when the broadcast moved from CBS to Fox. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/blogs/company-town-blog/story/2010-03-25/fox-sports-chief-david-hill-promises-no-geezers-during-next-super-bowl-halftime">In an interview</a>, Fox Sports President David Hill was asked if the next halftime performer would be under 60 years old and he gave an enthusiastic, “Oh, please God yes,” before adding: “I’m watching [the Who] going, ‘Oh no, please.'” These are not the words of a man likely to book Van Halen or Kiss anytime soon. Under Hill’s purview, pop would return to the Super Bowl in a huge way with the Black Eyed Peas, making Fergie the first female co-headliner since Janet Jackson. It was a statement booking: the group was fresh off a run of hits that included “Boom Boom Pow,” “I Gotta Feeling,” “Imma Be” (all #1 singles), “Rock That Body,” and “The Time (Dirty Bit).” The league didn’t look back from there; the next four headliners were Madonna, Beyoncé, Bruno Mars, and Katy Perry.</p>
<p>How has rock fared since that run? Not great, Bob! The closest things to a rock Halftime Show since the Who were Coldplay in 2016 and Maroon 5 in 2019. These are massively successful artists who thrive in their own ways, but they’re “rock” like a pizza Lunchable is pizza. So, when is “real” rock coming back to the Super Bowl? Unless Bad Bunny flashes something more objectionable than a boob on international television this year and the NFL retreats into booking Billy Joel for 2027, it likely won’t be for a long while, if ever.</p>
<p>McCartney, Springsteen, and the Who weren’t hit contemporary artists when they performed, but the appetite for rock music was stronger in the 2000s than it is today. Even if data put together by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1adgk10/every_rock_song_that_peaked_in_the_top_10_of_the/">this Reddit user</a> a few years ago isn’t completely accurate, it seems well-considered and strong enough to be appropriately illustrative in this informal context. They compiled a year-by-year list of all the “rock” songs that made the Top 10 on the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 chart since 2001, using, in their words, “a fairly inclusive definition of rock.” From 2001 to 2009, every year had at least five rock Top 10s, with 2002 having 12 such songs. Those numbers diminished in the early 2010s and from 2016 to 2024, just four songs made the cut: Imagine Dragons’ “Believer,” Olivia Rodrigo’s “Good 4 U” and “Bad Idea Right?,” and Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things.” Hell, if you exclude “Beautiful Things” (go ahead, I won’t put up a fight), 2024 had more Top 10 singles <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVli-tstM5E">name-dropping Nintendo</a> than Top 10 rock songs.</p><!-- admarker --> <div><div></div></div><!-- inline -->
<p>Artists like Geese, Wednesday, Hayley Williams, and Turnstile had some of 2025’s most critically beloved albums, but they’re better suited for a Tiny Desk Concert than the Super Bowl Halftime Show (with apologies to how influential Paramore was and continues to be for generations of rock and rock-adjacent musicians). With a lack of a strong rock presence in contemporary mainstream music, it’s hard to imagine a classic performer making sense for the Halftime Show, especially when the slot could instead go to a proven modern star making music in more relevant genres. (Fleetwood Mac might be the best candidate, given their internet-fueled resurgence in recent years, but <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/10/stevie-nicks-fleetwood-mac-future-barbie.html">a reunion seems unlikely</a> following the death of Christine McVie in 2022.)</p>
<p>When McCartney took the stage in 2005, it was a new direction. Given, it was one motivated by caution, but the league is continuing to experiment today. Bad Bunny and Shakira/Jennifer Lopez were the first Latin acts since Christina Aguilera and Enrique Iglesias in 2000. The two recent performances featuring Kendrick Lamar (guesting in 2022, headlining in 2025) were the first Halftime Shows with a focus on hip-hop since Diddy and Nelly were part of the Jackson/Timberlake debacle in 2004. Mainstream rock Halftime Shows might be dead, but what they initially represented—the NFL changing gears—is still alive and kicking.</p>
<p>If you want to grasp at some straws: Jay-Z and Roc Nation pick the talent for the Halftime Show these days, and given that Jay once made a collaborative remix EP with Linkin Park (2004’s <em>Collision Course</em>), maybe he still has a soft spot for rock. The genre isn’t in an awful place right now: Geese and the aforementioned others show it can still be exciting, while A-list stars like Olivia Rodrigo are unafraid to push a guitar-driven sound. But unless something drastically changes, the days of the dominant rockstar are over. The Halftime Show will likely never again be dominated by rock music like it was during that run from 2005 to 2010… unless at his upcoming performance, Bad Bunny decides to do a set of AC/DC covers or bring Rihanna out for “Shut Up And Drive.”</p><!-- inlinecontent_2 --> <!-- end the_content -->                                <div></div>

<p>Minutes after a federal agent shot and killed a Mexican immigrant in a Chicago suburb last September, a group of police officers stood on the sidewalk trying to figure out the answer to a question of protocol: Who would investigate the shooting?</p>



<p>“Wouldn’t it be state’s, at a minimum?” one Franklin Park officer asked, according to body camera footage.</p>



<p>Chief Mike Witz shook his head. “No, because it’s a federal shooting,” he said. “You’re not going to investigate a federal officer.”</p>



<p>His officers didn’t investigate. In their report, they didn’t even note the names of the two Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at the scene of Silverio Villegas González’s death. Instead, they deferred to the FBI.</p>



<p>Local law enforcement officials also did not investigate when a Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a U.S. citizen in her car in Chicago less than a month later. Or when an ICE agent in Phoenix shot a Honduran man during a traffic stop later that month.</p>



<p>In fact, local police did not open investigations into six of the 12 shootings by on-duty federal agents that have led to the deaths or injuries of citizens and immigrants since September, a ProPublica analysis found. In three other shooting cases, state or local police said they have opened inquiries, which they called a routine practice in those jurisdictions. And in Minnesota, where ICE and Border Patrol shot and killed two U.S. citizens and injured a Venezuelan man last month, state police have tried to conduct independent investigations only to be thwarted by the Trump administration, which has gone so far as to block officers from a scene, even when they had a judicial warrant.</p>
<div>
	<div></div>
</div>



<p>In almost every instance, President Donald Trump’s administration blamed the injured and dead for the shooting within hours of the incident, raising questions about whether federal officials can fairly and objectively investigate their own. Legal experts and advocates for immigrants say this apparent lack of accountability demands that local authorities step up and exercise their power to investigate and prosecute federal agents who break state laws — from battery to murder.</p>



<p>“Local police and the state have gotten a free pass,” said Craig Futterman, a law professor at the University of Chicago and the co-founder and director of its Civil Rights and Police Accountability Project. “Residents have every right and should be demanding that, ‘Hey, state authorities, police, local police: Protect us. Arrest people who kill us, who batter us, who point guns at us and threaten and assault us without legal cause to do so.’”</p>

</div><figcaption><span>Body camera footage shows then-Franklin Park Police Chief Mike Witz responding to his officers’ questions about whether they would investigate the shooting of a Mexican immigrant by federal agents.</span> <span>Obtained by ProPublica</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s usually the opposite scenario: federal authorities coming in to investigate a troubled police department. But local authorities have investigated and <a href="https://statedemocracy.law.wisc.edu/featured/2025/explainer-state-tools-to-address-federal-corruption/">charged federal agents in the past</a>. It’s just rare and complicated. The federal supremacy clause in the U.S. Constitution bars local interference with federal law enforcement officers when they act reasonably and within the scope of their duties.</p>



<p>But given the aggressive tactics employed by immigration agents under the Trump administration, Futterman and other legal experts said local police and prosecutors are morally obligated to at least try to hold federal law enforcement officers accountable.</p>



<p>“We’re in an environment right now where ICE officers are blatantly and egregiously violating the Constitution and the law,” said Joanna Schwartz, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. “The federal government has made it very clear that they are not going to do anything to provide any sort of accountability backstop to its officers. Unfortunately, because Congress is not taking any steps to rein ICE officers in, there really is no option other than states protecting their constituents’ rights.” </p>



<p>In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said that agents are “trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and our officers.” All use-of-force incidents are properly reported and reviewed by an appropriate law enforcement agency, the spokesperson said.</p>



<p>Immigration agents at the border have <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/02/27/283455547/report-criticizes-border-patrols-use-of-force">long been criticized</a> for use of deadly force and lack of rigorous investigations afterward. But now the same militarized force is on display in major American cities far from the border, where residents are not used to their presence. </p>



<p>The shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last month — and the federal government’s resistance to a routine local investigation — has prompted Democratic and some Republican officials across the country to call for more accountability. Last week, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing police officers to document alleged illegal activity by federal immigration agents and refer any evidence of felonies to prosecutors. </p>



<p>California’s governor and attorney general issued a reminder to local police of their rights to investigate federal agents. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes launched a website asking residents to submit evidence of federal agents’ misconduct. And prosecutors from nine jurisdictions around the country announced a new coalition to provide mutual support to law enforcement authorities bringing charges against federal officers.</p>



<p>In Minneapolis, prosecutors say they’re working with state police to investigate in spite of resistance from federal officials. So far, DHS officials have refused to provide evidence or even the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/alex-pretti-shooting-cbp-agents-identified-jesus-ochoa-raymundo-gutierrez">names of the agents involved in the January shootings</a>. Prosecutors went so far as to obtain an emergency order to require that federal agencies preserve evidence in the Pretti case. A judge dropped the temporary restraining order on Monday, following assurances from the federal government that it would maintain investigative materials. </p>



<p>The prosecutors said they believe they can still gather enough evidence to make an informed decision about whether to charge the federal agents.</p>



<p>“We get cases submitted to us every day that don’t have all the evidence we would like,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said in an interview. “We would certainly like the gun. We would like the shell casings, that kind of thing. But it’s also not a mystery as to why these people died.”</p>
<div>
	<div></div>
</div>



<p>Even after getting a judicial warrant, investigators from the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension were turned away by federal agents from the Minneapolis intersection where Pretti, 37, was shot and killed. Federal officials also excluded the BCA from the investigation into the death of Renee Good, who was shot and killed in her car two weeks before Pretti. </p>



<p>BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said he’d never seen his officers physically stopped from doing their job by another law enforcement agency. Across the country, he said, state agencies like the BCA routinely investigate deadly force incidents like this one.</p>



<p>“We’re in uncharted territory here,” he said.</p>



<p>Within hours of each killing, Trump officials publicly labeled the dead “domestic terrorists.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti was “brandishing” a gun when he approached the officers, while the Border Patrol’s Gregory Bovino claimed Pretti was planning a “massacre.” </p>



<p>Video footage contradicted the administration’s version of events. Pretti, for instance, never unholstered his gun, which he was legally allowed to carry.  </p>



<p>Early last week, Trump sent Bovino and Border Patrol agents away from Minneapolis, and on Wednesday DHS officials said they would pull another 700 agents out of the state — signs  the administration may be changing its approach in response to rising criticism. The FBI is now investigating the Pretti shooting, and the Justice Department announced Friday that it had opened a civil rights investigation. </p>



<p>A DOJ spokesperson did not answer questions for this story but referred reporters to a press conference last weekend in which Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche said DHS is following its normal investigative protocols in the Pretti shooting. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Justice Department has said it has no plans to investigate Good’s shooting. </p>



<p>“We don’t just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody putting his life in danger,” Blanche told Fox News.</p>

<hr>



<p>Police in Franklin Park and Chicago have not explained why they didn’t open their own investigations into the two shootings last fall. In the Franklin Park case, the decision to let the FBI alone investigate the killing of Villegas was made within minutes of the shooting, according to dispatch records. </p>



<p>Villegas, a 38-year-old restaurant cook, was shot as he tried to drive away from ICE agents who had pulled him over. As in Minneapolis, the Trump administration’s narrative of what happened did not match the evidence. DHS claimed that Villegas dragged one of the agents, causing serious injuries. The agent fired “because he feared for his life,” officials said. Police body camera footage released after the shooting showed the agent downplaying his injury as “nothing major.”</p>



<p>At the scene, Franklin Park police officers directed traffic and interviewed a witness, the footage shows. At one point, one officer told his colleague that the police department was “just securing until they get here,” referring to the FBI.</p>
<div>
	<div></div>
</div>



<p>Witz, who was then the police chief but has since retired, could not be reached for comment; the current chief did not respond to interview requests.</p>



<p>A similar situation unfolded in Chicago on Oct. 4 after a Border Patrol agent fired into the vehicle of a woman who federal officials claimed “ambushed” them. Marimar Martinez was charged with assaulting federal agents, though the charges were later dropped. </p>



<p>At the time, the Chicago Police Department said officers had responded to a call about a shooting “to document the incident” and to “maintain safety and traffic control.” When asked last week why it didn’t open an independent inquiry, the department directed ProPublica to its October statement, which made clear the police were “not involved in the incident or its investigation” and directed questions to federal authorities. </p>



<p>As the events in Minneapolis continued to generate criticism nationwide, Chicago’s mayor unveiled his executive order that directed officers to investigate federal immigration agents who break the law and to refer them for criminal prosecution. In a statement, the mayor’s office said the initiative was a response to “the absence of legal repercussions in the wake of the shooting of Marimar Martinez in Chicago and the killings of Silverio Villegas González in Franklin Park and Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.”</p>



<p>Legal experts said they were not aware of recent examples of Illinois law enforcement agencies investigating an on-duty federal agent, though last month a suburban police department obtained misdemeanor charges against an off-duty ICE agent accused of attacking an activist who was filming him while the agent was pumping gas. </p>



<p>Illinois State Police officials said they would investigate federal agents who were accused of breaking the law if they are asked to do so.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called on a state accountability commission to examine the roles of key Trump officials in the escalation of aggressive tactics during a monthslong immigration enforcement campaign in Chicago and its suburbs late last year. Pritzker had previously established the commission to​ gather videos and testimonies about federal agents’ conduct, and to create a public record of what happened. The commission lacks subpoena power but can refer information about potential violations of state law to law enforcement agencies or prosecutors.</p>



<p>“Just imagine if the agents who shot Mr. Villegas González back on Sept. 12 had been publicly disciplined,” Rubén Castillo, a retired federal judge who chairs the commission, said at a hearing Friday. “Maybe, just maybe, the Minnesota shootings would not have occurred, and two people would be alive who are now dead.”</p>



<p>He added: “We will have conversations with those in local law enforcement to suggest prosecutions that should be occurring even as we speak.”</p>

<hr>



<p>In California, neither the Los Angeles nor Ontario police departments investigated after two men were shot by federal immigration agents in separate October incidents and then accused of assaulting federal officers — despite video evidence and victim statements that conflicted with the accounts officials provided. A federal judge dismissed the case against one man, a Mexican immigrant and popular TikTokker; the other, a U.S. citizen, pleaded not guilty and has a trial scheduled for April.</p>



<p>Police in Phoenix also said they are not investigating the shooting of a man who federal officials say fled immigration agents last October, leaving the case to the FBI and ICE. And local police in Portland, Oregon, are not investigating an incident where federal agents shot at a Venezuelan man who had allegedly hit an unoccupied Border Patrol vehicle with his car in early January, injuring him and his passenger. The man was later charged with assaulting an officer. Unlike in some of the other cases, the Oregon attorney general’s office has opened its own investigation.</p>



<p>In contrast, police in Pima County, Arizona, and Anne Arundel County, Maryland, and the Texas Rangers have all said they opened investigations into recent shootings involving federal immigration officers.</p>
<div>

</div>



<p>Asking local officials to investigate their federal counterparts does not come without challenges. Police officers and prosecutors are wary of being seen as interfering with federal law enforcement operations. They may be reluctant to damage their already complicated relationships with agencies with whom they sometimes partner. </p>



<p>Then there’s the worry about the political consequences, including the threat of losing federal funding, a dynamic that’s particularly acute under the Trump administration.</p>



<p>“This particular federal government has lobbed all kinds of threats and acted on threats against local authorities and state authorities for failure to cooperate or not do what they want them to do,” said Futterman, the University of Chicago law professor. “It’s a reason in itself not to bite a hand that feeds you.”</p>



<p>Even when local officials open their own investigations into federal agents, there’s no guarantee they can bring the cases to court. Federal agents can claim immunity in response to state charges, legal experts said, and can move their cases to federal court.</p>



<p>That immunity stems from a Supreme Court ruling more than a century ago. During the Civil Rights Movement, that immunity was used when the federal government wanted to protect its law enforcement officers tasked with enforcing then-controversial efforts like desegregation in hostile states. </p>



<p>Now local officials face the opposite challenge: protecting their constituents’ constitutional rights from what they believe is excessive force at the hands of federal officers. </p>



<p>Steve Descano, the commonwealth’s attorney for Fairfax County, Virginia, would be the first to admit that nothing about prosecuting federal agents is easy. During the first Trump administration, Descano brought state manslaughter charges against two U.S. Park Police officers who shot and killed a Virginia man. A federal judge dismissed the case in 2021 and said the officers were entitled to immunity because their actions were necessary and proper.</p>



<p>Still, Descano, who is part of the coalition of prosecutors aiming to hold federal law enforcement accountable, said he believed he and others have a responsibility to do so. </p>



<p>“If they are not willing to take these actions,” he said, “then they are cowards and they are not worthy of their positions.”</p>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt; New research published in Nature Astronomy suggests that a vast, flat sheet of dark matter explains why the Andromeda Galaxy is on a collision course with the Milky Way while other nearby galaxies are receding. The study found that this specific dark matter distribution exerts a gravitational pull that accelerates the expansion of more distant galaxies away from us—surpassing the speeds predicted by Hubble's Law—while allowing the Milky Way and Andromeda to remain gravitationally bound to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

It's mathematically described by Hubble's law, named after astronomer <a href="https://www.livescience.com/64527-edwin-hubble-universe-expanding.html"><u>Edwin Hubble</u></a>, who discovered the expansion of the universe in the 1920s. His eponymous law constrains an observational phenomenon: Galaxies are moving away from Earth at speeds that are proportional to their distance.

In 1959, astronomers Franz Kahn and Lodewijk Woltjer found evidence of dark matter situated around Andromeda and the Milky Way. They calculated that to reverse the initial expansion imparted by the Big Bang, these two galaxies would require a combined mass much greater <a href="https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/1138002/news20260127"><u>than all their stars put together</u></a>.</p><p>It turns out that a significant portion of the <a href="https://www.livescience.com/63410-llm-how-much-milky-way-weighs.html"><u>mass of the Milky Way</u></a> and Andromeda is contained in dark matter halos that surround each galaxy and facilitate the galaxies' rapid approach toward each other.</p><p>However, this attraction does not seem to affect nearby galaxies outside the Local Group, where "material is actually moving away from the Milky Way faster than the Hubble flow," study co-author <a href="https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~swhite/"><u>Simon White</u></a>, director emeritus of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Germany, said in a <a href="https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/1138002/news20260127"><u>statement</u></a>.</p><aside>

They ran a multitude of simulations to explore the interactions among dark matter, our Local Group, and the receding galaxies just outside it, to a distance of around 32 million light-years.</p><p>The simulations modeled the evolution of the local universe from the beginning of <a href="https://www.livescience.com/space-time.html"><u>space-time</u></a>, starting with the mass distributions observed in the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Cosmic_Microwave_Background_CMB_radiation"><u>cosmic microwave background</u></a>, the oldest light in the cosmos, emitted when the universe was just 380,000 years old. The researchers then had the model reproduce certain salient characteristics observed in nearby galaxies, including the mass, position and velocity of Andromeda and the Milky Way, as well as the positions and velocities of 31 galaxies located just outside the Local Group.</p><p>This revealed that the mass just slightly beyond the Local Group, including both <a href="https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/dark-matter"><u>dark matter</u></a> and visible matter, is distributed in a vast, flat sheet that stretches for tens of millions of light-years and continues beyond the boundaries of the simulation.</p><p>Because nearby galaxies are embedded in this flattened sheet of dark matter, any gravitational pull from our Local Group is counteracted by the gravitational pull from the more distant mass in the sheet, drawing them away from us.</p><p>"If the mass were distributed approximately spherically around the Local Group, rather than being flat, then the external galaxies would be moving away from us slower than predicted by Hubble's law for the cosmic expansion, because they would be slowed down by the gravitational pull of the Milky Way and Andromeda," White told Live Science. "Instead, the flattened distribution of the surrounding matter pulls these galaxies outwards in a way which almost exactly compensates for the inward pull of the [Milky Way] and [Andromeda]."</p><p>Equally important, the regions above and below the sheet are devoid of galaxies. Such sparse regions occur <a href="https://www.livescience.com/65928-stare-into-the-fuzzy-dark-void.html"><u>throughout the cosmos</u></a>, and the deep Local Voids around our Local Group formed in areas where the initial density of the universe was a bit lower than average.</p><p>"As a result these regions expanded faster than average, and their matter was 'pushed' outwards," White said via email. "By the present day these low-density regions fill most of space and gravitational effects have concentrated most of their material into the 'walls' that separate them."</p><a></a><h2>Reconciling experiments, observations and models</h2><p>The location of the voids is essential. These sparse regions are where any existing structures would fall toward the Local Group; any galaxies there would indeed be moving toward us. So we don't see any other objects careening toward the Milky Way, as Andromeda is doing, because there simply aren't any galaxies there to do so.</p><p>Overall, when accounting for the vast sheet of mass, the simulations accurately modeled the distribution of nearby galaxies and the voids, thereby reconciling experimental results with astronomical observations of galactic motions as well as with the leading model of cosmology, known as <a href="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/100-undiscovered-galaxies-may-be-orbiting-the-milky-way-supercomputer-simulations-hint"><u>lambda cold dark matter</u></a>.</p><div><div>related stories</div><div><p>—<a href="https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/dark-matter/giant-rogue-waves-of-invisible-matter-might-be-disrupting-the-orbits-of-stars-new-study-hints">Giant 'rogue waves' of invisible matter might be disrupting the orbits of stars, new study hints</a></p><p>—<a href="https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/dark-matter/ghostly-galaxy-without-dark-matter-baffles-astronomers">Ghostly galaxy without dark matter baffles astronomers</a></p><p>—<a href="https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/dark-matter/heavy-dark-matter-would-rip-our-understanding-of-the-universe-apart-new-research-suggests">'Heavy' dark matter would rip our understanding of the universe apart, new research suggests</a></p></div></div><p>"We are exploring all possible local configurations of the early universe that ultimately could lead to the Local Group," lead study author <a href="https://ewoudwempe.com"><u>Ewoud Wempe</u></a>, a cosmologist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, said in a <a href="https://www.rug.nl/fse/news/matter-and-space/a-large-scale-sheet-surrounding-of-the-milky-way-explains-the-motion-of-nearby-galaxies?lang=en"><u>different statement</u></a>. "It is great that we now have a model that is consistent with the current cosmological model on the one hand, and with the dynamics of our local environment on the other."</p><p>Interestingly, the researchers report that high-latitude galaxies farther out in the cosmos have been observed to be falling toward the flat sheet of matter at several hundred kilometers per hour. Finding additional structures infalling from the directions of the voids could lend further support to the results of this study.</p><div>

<p> "This chicken fra diavolo is chicken thighs in my version of fra diavolo sauce, the spicy Italian pepper and tomato sauce with fresh herbs and white wine, usually used with seafood. We like spicy, and I wondered, “why not chicken?” We liked it with crusty bread, to get every last drop of the sauce." —Brenda Venable

        <div><p>Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story: </p><ul><li>A retired volunteer unearthed a rare 1,000-year-old Pictish ring during excavations in Scotland.</li><li>The ring is one of the few Pictish rings ever discovered and offers insights into the Pictish kingdom’s history.</li><li>The find sheds light on the Picts, a powerful group who defended Scotland from invaders and mysteriously vanished by the end of the first millennium.</li></ul><hr><p>A “remarkable” ring dating back at least a millennium was unearthed near the <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a19673603/dino-footprints-scotland/">Scottish shore</a>. And it wasn’t some seasoned archeologist who made the find, but rather, a self-described “enthusiastic volunteer” who uncovered this <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a65187570/northern-lights-make-noise/">ancient</a> piece of jewelry.<br></p><p>John Ralph, a 68-year-old former engineer, had started out simply looking to make use of his free time. “I had recently retired and saw a post looking for volunteers to help with the Burghead excavations,” he told <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vx2nvk6kgo"><em>BBC Scotland</em></a>, “My sister still lives in Burghead and it sounded interesting so I thought why not. I have now joined three different <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/adventure/outdoors/a42953312/jesse-jamess-lost-gold/">digs</a> there, each for two weeks.”</p><section></section><p>The excavated area is thought to have been a settlement that served as “a significant seat of power” during the Pictish kingdom between 500 and 1000 CE. At first, Ralph felt he was making remarkable discovery after remarkable discovery, only to be told by the attending experts that he’d merely found some glistening <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/a64700460/only-alcatraz-prison-break/">rocks</a>.</p><section><aside><h6><span></span><span>Related Story</span><span></span></h6><ul><li><a href="/culture/a69958310/global-sand-shortage-mafia/"><span></span><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/5704e986-96db-4322-a7db-4be6d5b67815.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.332xh&amp;resize=300:*" alt title="global-sand-shortage-mafia"><span>The World Is Running Out of Sand</span><span></span></a></li></ul></aside></section><p>“I thoroughly enjoyed them all but my initial enthusiasm for finds was somewhat dented by my knack of getting excited for shiny pebbles,” Ralph summarized, “I had found a few interesting items including bone pins and it was great being part of the team, which was the real draw.”</p><p>But that changed when Ralph was simply cleaning the floor of a structure. He first spotted a metal pin, and then “lo and behold, there was the ring.”</p><section><div><section><div><div><img src="/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=currentColor&amp;id=link-out-embed" alt="instagram"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_fbwB1q3nk/">View full post on Instagram</a></div></div></section></div></section><p>“John was digging and then came over and said ‘look what I’ve found,’” Gordon Noble, Professor of Archaeology at the University of Aberdeen told BBC Scotland. Noble, who has led the excavation work over the last three years, felt what Ralph had stumbled upon was “truly incredible,” noting that, “we could see it was something really exciting as despite more than 1,000 years in the ground we could see glints of the possible garnet setting.”</p><p>This surprising discovery was made all the more remarkable, Noble added, because, “there are very few Pictish rings which have ever been discovered and those we do know about usually come from hoards which were placed in the ground deliberately for safekeeping in some way.”</p><section><aside><h6><span></span><span>Related Story</span><span></span></h6><ul><li><a href="/adventure/a36082822/the-real-story-of-the-oak-island-money-pit/"><span></span><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/oak-island-brandon-ko-thc-1619118290.jpg?crop=1xw:0.8152173913043478xh;center,top&amp;resize=300:*" alt title="Scene from the show The Curse of Oak Island on The History Channel"><span>The Real Story of Oak Island’s Legendary Money Pit</span><span></span></a></li></ul></aside></section><p>The Picts, called Picti by the <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a64051065/excavation-changes-roman-empire-history/">Romans</a> from the Latin for “Painted Ones,” were northern tribes who made up the largest kingdom in Dark Age <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a25266/archaeological-find-scotland/">Scotland</a>, per <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/kingdom_of_the_picts/">the BBC</a>. Noteworthy warriors, the Picts held back invasion attempts by not just the Romans, but also the Angles, the latter during the famous Battle of Dun Nechtain.</p><p>“If the Picts had lost,” the BBC wrote of the ferocious fight against the Northumbrian Angle invaders, “Scotland might never have existed.” However, in spite of their military might, the Picts would “disappear from history by the end of the first millennium,” with the BBC noting that they were “swallowed whole by the history of another group, the Gaels.”</p><p>So this ring, stumbled upon by a volunteer with a knack for finding “shiny pebbles,” not only offers a connection to a crucial group of people in Scotland’s history, but it might also provide a greater understanding of a kingdom who “disappeared from history.” The ring is currently at the National Museum of Scotland for analysis.</p><div><div><div><h2><span></span>Our Most-Read Stories of the Year<span></span></h2><div><button><img src="/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-left-regular.dc4f48a.svg?primary=%2523D4D4D4" alt="Chevron Left Icon"></button><button><img src="/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right-regular.e879c19.svg?primary=%2523fff" alt="Chevron Right Icon"></button></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/popspecialstories01-691b7fa11276b.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=640:*" alt="a hidden state exists between life and death" title="a hidden state exists between life and death"><h6></h6><div><p><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a63917106/cells-conscious-xenobots/">Find Answers </a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/popspecialstories03-691b8036b56a4.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=640:*" alt="gravity may prove the universe is a simulation" title="gravity may prove the universe is a simulation"><h6></h6><div><p><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a64855171/universe-is-a-simulation-gravity/">Get The Facts </a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/popspecialstories06-691b8094975f4.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=640:*" alt="scientists found a computer older than history" title="scientists found a computer older than history"><h6></h6><div><p><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a63683503/antikythera-mechanism/">Learn The Truth</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/popspecialstories04-691b800d2a3ff.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=640:*" alt="admiral warns of intelligence hiding underwater" title="admiral warns of intelligence hiding underwater"><h6></h6><div><p><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a64073070/ufos-hiding-underwater/">What Are They? </a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/popspecialstories02-691b7fd9781c3.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=640:*" alt="build a smokeless fire pit at home" title="build a smokeless fire pit at home"><h6></h6><div><p><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/outdoor-projects/a39852727/diy-smokeless-fire-pit/">Start Your Build</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/popspecialstories05-691b8069d24bd.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=640:*" alt="you can develop a real life sixth sense" title="you can develop a real life sixth sense"><h6></h6><div><p><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a64855171/universe-is-a-simulation-gravity/">Transform Your Perception</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><span><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a0a518c7-4b7c-4fec-af85-d82b1326dcac_1746820427.file?fill=1:1&amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Michael Natale" title="Headshot of Michael Natale"></span><div><span><a href="/author/231777/michael-natale/"><span>Michael Natale</span></a></span><div>News Editor</div></div><div><div><p>Michale Natale is a News Editor for the Hearst Enthusiast Group.

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt; The article examines the financial decline and massive restructuring of the Washington Post under Jeff Bezos's ownership. Despite early optimism and growth, significant losses in 2023 and 2024 have led to a 'strategic reset' involving more than 300 layoffs, the shuttering of the sports department, and major reductions to metro and foreign desks.&lt;/p&gt;

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article examines the financial decline and massive restructuring of the Washington Post under Jeff Bezos's ownership. Despite early optimism and growth, significant losses in 2023 and 2024 have led to a 'strategic reset' involving more than 300 layoffs, the shuttering of the sports department, and major reductions to metro and foreign desks.</p>

        <div><p>Downie, who served as executive editor from 1991 to 2008, contrasted the paths of the <em>Times</em> and the <em>Post</em>. During the past decade, the <em>Times</em> transformed itself into a one-stop-shopping environment that lured readers with games such as Spelling Bee, a cooking app, and a shopping guide. By the end of 2025, it was reporting close to thirteen million digital subscribers and an operating profit of more than a hundred and ninety-two million dollars. The <em>Post</em> does not release information about its digital subscribers, but it was reported to have two and a half million digital subscribers at the time of the non-endorsement decision, in 2024.</p><p>“One of the big differences to me was that they hired a publisher”—Ryan—“who didn’t come up with any ideas,” Downie told me. “And then when he left . . . we knew that Bezos was losing money, and we were encouraged by the fact that they were looking for somebody who could improve the business side of the paper and the circulation side of the paper. And then they chose this guy who we hardly ever heard from, who had a checkered past in British journalism.”</p><p>Writing last month on a private Listserv for former <em>Post</em> employees, Paul Farhi, who as the media reporter for the <em>Post</em> covered Bezos’s acquisition of the paper, shared his “utter mystification and bafflement” about Bezos’s tolerance of Lewis. “Even as a hands-off boss,” he wondered, “could Bezos not see what was obvious to even casual observers within a few months of Will’s arrival—that Will was ill-suited to the Post, that he had alienated the newsroom, that he had an ethically suspect past, and—most important—that none of his big ideas was working or even being implemented?” (Farhi, who took a buyout in 2023, gave me permission to quote his message.)</p><p>Even before these new cuts, a parade of key staffers had left the <em>Post</em>. A beloved managing editor, Matea Gold, went to the <em>Times</em>. The national editor, Philip Rucker, decamped to CNN, and the political reporter Josh Dawsey to the <em>Wall Street</em> <em>Journal</em>. The <em>Atlantic</em> hired, among others, three stars of the paper’s White House team: Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, and Toluse Olorunnipa. These are losses that would take years to rebuild—if the <em>Post</em> were in a rebuilding mode. The <em>Post</em>, Woodward said, “lives and is doing an extraordinary reporting job on the political crisis that is Donald Trump”—including its scoop on the second strike to kill survivors of an attack on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat. But the print edition is a shadow of its former self, with metro, style, and sports melded into an anemic second section; daily print circulation is now below one hundred thousand. More pressingly, it’s unclear whether a newsroom so stripped of resources can sustain the quality of its work.</p><p>The sports columnist Sally Jenkins, who left the <em>Post</em> in August, 2025, as part of the second wave of buyouts, has been more supportive of management than many other <em>Post</em> veterans. So it was striking that, when we spoke recently, she was both passionate about the work of her newsroom colleagues and unsparing about how the business side had failed them. “When you whack at these sections, you’re whacking at the roots of the tree,” she told me. “We train great journalists in every section of the paper, and we train them to cover every subject on the globe. And when you whack whole sections of people away, you are really, really in danger of killing the whole tree.” When I asked how she felt about the losses, Jenkins said, “My heart is cracked in about five different pieces.”</p></div>

<p>Little kids hosting make-believe tea parties is a fixture of childhood playtime and long presumed to be exclusively a human ability. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University presented evidence in a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adz0743">new paper</a> published in the journal Science that a bonobo named Kanzi was also able to participate in pretending to hold a tea party. For the authors, this suggests that apes are capable of using their imagination just like human toddlers.</p>
<p>“It really is game-changing that their mental lives go beyond the here and now,” said co-author Christopher Krupenye. “Imagination has long been seen as a critical element of what it is to be human, but the idea that it may not be exclusive to our species is really transformative. Jane Goodall discovered that chimps make tools, and that led to a change in the definition of what it means to be human, and this, too, really invites us to reconsider what makes us special and what mental life is out there among other creatures.”</p>
<p>Per Krupenye et al., by the age of two, human children are able to navigate imaginary scenarios like a tea party, pretending there is real tea present even if the teapot and cups are actually empty. Cognitively speaking, it’s an example of secondary representation, because it involves decoupling an imagined or simulated state (pretending there is actual tea in the cup) with the reality (the cup is empty).</p>
<p>Scientists have long pondered whether other animals, notably primates, also possess such mental capacities. There is some anecdotal evidence for this. For instance, a young chimpanzee <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10329-020-00836-z">was observed</a> dragging imaginary blocks across the floor, just as the chimp did with real wooden blocks. Some female chimps in the wild will carry and play with sticks, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982210014491">treating them as infants</a>—a rudimentary form of playing with a doll. And a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0885201406000451">2006 study</a> found that chimps and bonobos that had been exposed to human culture would sometimes perform pretend actions, like holding a bowl to a doll’s mouth to feed it, in response to verbal prompts.</p>

On paper, it’s a close matchup—but our staff has a clear favorite. Who will come out on top on Sunday?</em></p><h2>24-16, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP: </strong>Jaxon Smith-Njigba<br><strong>Unlikely hero: </strong>DeMarcus Lawrence</p><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/sheil-kapadia"><strong>Sheil Kapadia:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I think there are two ways that the Patriots <em>could </em>win: One, Drake Maye puts the team on his back (possible!). Two, Sam Darnold turns into a pumpkin (also possible!). But I think that the Seahawks are the better team on a down-to-down basis. I think that their defensive front will control the game against New England's shaky offensive line, and I give Mike Macdonald a big edge over Josh McDaniels from a coaching perspective. On the other side of the ball, the Patriots like to play a lot of man coverage, and Smith-Njigba destroys man coverage. I see a competitive game, with the Seahawks doing just enough offensively to be crowned champs.</p><h2>27-21, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP: </strong>Sam Darnold<br><strong>Unlikely hero: </strong>Sam Darnold</p><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/nora-princiotti"><strong>Nora Princiotti:</strong></a><strong> </strong>OK, so “unlikely” might be too cute, or require a season-long mindset. But come on. There’s no more unlikely hero than Darnold, who before this season was best known for experiencing paranormal activity on the football field and having mononucleosis that one time. In theory, Darnold doesn’t have to make that many big plays for the Seahawks to carry this one, thanks to their defense, but stylistically, he’s a boom-or-bust guy. That Darnold would become the first quarterback from the class of 2018 to start in the Super Bowl seemed <em>extremely </em>unlikely not long ago, and even a moment or two of heroism in a Seattle win on Sunday would cap one of the most shocking player turnaround stories in NFL history.</p><h2>16-10, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP: </strong>Jaxon Smith-Njigba<br><strong>Unlikely hero:</strong> Michael Dickson</p><div></div><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/danny-kelly"><strong>Danny Kelly:</strong></a><strong> </strong>It feels like this is going to be a low-scoring, knock-down, drag-out battle between two really good defenses. The Seahawks’ fearsome defensive front will make life hard for the Patriots offensive line, shutting down the run while getting after Drake Maye for most of the game. On the other side of the coin, I could see New England’s defense giving Seattle’s offense fits, too. That will turn this game into a competition of who can take care of the ball and win the field-position battle. Seattle’s steely punter, Michael Dickson, will do his part to pin the Pats deep in their own end. And while it won’t always be pretty, I think Sam Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and Co. will be able to do just enough to pull away with the victory. </p><div><div></div><p>Previewing Super Bowl LX<!-- --> </p><div><div><button>Articles</button><button>Podcasts</button></div><div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div></div><p>Previewing Super Bowl LX<!-- --> </p><div><div><button>Articles</button><button>Podcasts</button></div><div></div><div></div></div></div><h2>24-20, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP: </strong>DeMarcus Lawrence<br><strong>Unlikely hero:</strong> AJ Barner</p><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/steven-ruiz"><strong>Steven Ruiz:</strong></a><strong> </strong>This isn't a terrible matchup for the Patriots, but the talent gap is just too wide for me to back them. A few Sam Darnold turnovers will be required to keep things close, which is certainly in the range of realistic outcomes. But the Seahawks quarterback will have a wide margin for error on Sunday thanks to his defense, which can overwhelm a leaky New England offensive line and make Drake Maye’s Super Bowl debut a miserable experience. I’ve got DeMarcus Lawrence getting a fourth-quarter strip sack to put the game away. And even if Seattle’s offense turns in a chaotic performance, it’s too explosive to hold down for a full 60-minute game and should score enough points to win. New England will be ready for the downfield shots to Jaxon Smith-Njigba, which could open up space underneath for tight end AJ Barner to have a busy night. Eventually, though, JSN will strike and put the Pats away.</p><h2>34-14, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP: </strong>Sam Darnold<br><strong>Unlikely hero:</strong> Ernest Jones IV</p><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/diante-lee"><strong>Diante Lee:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I’ve tried to couch all my takes on Super Bowl LX with the tired “Anything can happen” nonsense. But I’m dropping the niceties after rewatching the film. Seattle is faster, is deeper in the trenches, and has more avenues to win than New England does. We just haven’t seen the Patriots play a team as good as Seattle. And it feels wrong to say, but I think I trust quarterback Sam Darnold to protect the ball more than Drake Maye, given how this postseason has played out. Don’t be shocked if this game gets out of hand pretty quickly.</p><h2>31-9, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP:</strong> Sam Darnold<br><strong>Unlikely hero: </strong>Ernest Jones IV</p><div></div><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/danny-heifetz"><strong>Danny Heifetz:</strong></a><strong> </strong>New England's offense is good. Seattle's defense is historic. New England is trotting out a rookie left tackle and a rookie left guard versus the best and most sophisticated defense in years. For all the fears that Darnold will make a dumb turnover (or three), people have forgotten that Maye had more combined picks and fumbles in the Patriots-Texans game than C.J. Stroud did. Steel yourself to see Darnold holding the Lombardi Trophy.</p><h2>28-17, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP:</strong> Sam Darnold<br><strong>Unlikely hero: </strong>Ernest Jones IV</p><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/lindsay-jones"><strong>Lindsay Jones:</strong></a> I will not let how weird the words "Sam Darnold, Super Bowl champion" sound inside my brain cause me to overthink this: Seattle has been one of the best teams all season. Its success, including Darnold’s, is not a fluke. And while it very much seems like this is the start of a great new era for the Patriots, this is Seattle's time. </p><h2>23-14, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP: </strong>Sam Darnold<br><strong>Unlikely hero: </strong>Sam Darnold</p><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/austin-gayle"><strong>Austin Gayle:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Darnold is an unlikely hero! A year ago, all he was known for was shitting his pants in big games, taking bad sacks, and making worse turnovers. Two years ago, he was a backup in San Francisco. Before that, he was a failed reclamation experiment in Carolina and an all-time draft bust for the Jets. You’d have to go all the way back to the ’80s and Jim Plunkett, a former no. 1 pick, to find a draft bust turned Super Bowl–winning quarterback. (You could count former no. 9 pick Trent Dilfer and his win with the Ravens in 2000, but he was more of a disappointment for Tampa Bay than a bust.) Darnold will join rare company if he pulls it off on Sunday, and he doesn’t need to be a superhero to make it happen. Smith-Njigba and Kenneth Walker III are game-wrecking skill players, and the Seattle defense is arguably the best the NFL has seen in the past five years. The moment just can’t be too big for Darnold. The ghosts of his past can’t creep back in. If he avoids game-altering mistakes, he will complete one of the biggest career turnarounds in NFL history. </p><h2>24-20, Seahawks </h2><p><strong>MVP: </strong>Sam Darnold <br><strong>Unlikely hero:</strong> Rashid Shaheed</p><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/riley-mcatee"><strong>Riley McAtee:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Seattle is the better team, although it's close. The main matchup I am looking at is how Smith-Njigba fares against Christian Gonzalez and New England’s secondary—and as good as Gonzalez is, I think that the advantage lies firmly with the Offensive Player of the Year. Both quarterbacks in this matchup face tough tests, but Darnold has arguably the best playmaker in the league—and New England’s defense, while quite good, isn’t on the level of Seattle’s. The Seahawks can make Darnold’s job a bit easier than the Patriots can Maye’s, and I think that difference in supporting casts will prove to be the key factor. Darnold will officially exorcise the "seeing ghosts" demons on the biggest stage.</p><h2>24-16, Seahawks</h2><p><strong>MVP: </strong>Jaxon Smith-Njigba<br><strong>Unlikely hero: </strong>Nick Emmanwori</p><div></div><p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/anthony-dabbundo"><strong>Anthony Dabbundo:</strong></a><strong> </strong>New England's offense has struggled in all three of its playoff games against top-tier AFC defenses, and I don't expect the Super Bowl to go much differently against another elite defense. Maye has taken 15 sacks and fumbled five times under pressure throughout January, and I know that Macdonald has spent every waking moment scheming up ways to pressure him on Sunday.

	President <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> went on a wild social media posting spree late Thursday night and into this morning, one that included a video depicting Barack and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/michelle-obama/">Michelle Obama</a> as apes, set to “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”</p>



<p>
	The clip of the Obamas, which appears to be AI-generated, comes near the end of a 62-second video about election conspiracy theories. Trump posted the video just before midnight on Thursday. The post was taken down late this morning amid bipartisan backlash.</p>



<p>
	The White House initially defended the post. “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from <em>The Lion King</em>,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a statement. “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”</p>



<p>
	The White House <a href="https://x.com/alaynatreene/status/2019816430834000181/history">told CNN</a> later this morning, however, that the post was made “erroneously” by a staffer, and that the post has been removed from Trump’s Truth Social feed.

<p>
	The video is the latest entry in the right’s long history of racism directed at the Obamas. Trump ahead of the 2012 presidential election famously pushed the “birther” conspiracy theory that <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a> was actually born in Africa and not a U.S. citizen. “An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that @BarackObama’s birth certificate is a fraud,” he tweeted that year. Obama had already released his long-form birth certificate to throw cold water on the conspiracy theory a year prior.</p>



<p>
	Democrats were quick today to condemn the post depicting the Obamas as apes. </p>



<p>
	“Disgusting behavior by the President,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s press office <a href="https://x.com/GovPressOffice/status/2019658680933999090">wrote</a> shortly after Trump posted the clip. “Every single Republican must denounce this. Now.”</p>



<p>
	“Trump is a vile racist old man. The people in the <a href="https://x.com/HouseGOP">@HouseGOP</a> that don’t speak out on this, I’m going to assume you support this racism,” <a href="https://x.com/RepHerbConaway/status/2019762335842279777">wrote</a> Rep. Herb Conaway (D-N.J.), who is Black.

	“Let it haunt Trump and his racist followers that future Americans will embrace the Obamas as beloved figures while studying him as a stain on our history,” Ben Rhodes, a national security adviser under Obama, <a href="https://x.com/brhodes/status/2019674836189213095">posted</a> on X.

	“Every Republican will pretend they didn’t see it, no reporter should let them get away with it,” <a href="https://x.com/danpfeiffer/status/2019771646790582482">wrote</a> Dan Pfeiffer, another former Obama adviser.</p>



<p>
	The NAACP also weighed in. “Donald Trump’s racist video is disgusting and utterly despicable,” the organization wrote in a statement. “Trump is obviously desperate to distract us from the Epstein files and his rapidly failing economy. You know who isn’t in the Epstein files? Barack Obama.”</p>



<p>
	Some on the right seemed to recognize that Trump posting the video was not a good look. “FAKE NEWS ALERT! Trump Didn’t post this monkey video of the obamas. Lying Democrats. It’s not on his page. Fake screenshot,” <a href="https://x.com/w_terrence/status/2019684079894171988">wrote</a> MAGA influencer Terrence K. Williams to his 2.4 million X followers. Williams was quickly corrected by fact-checkers and a community note was soon attached to his post, which has not been deleted as of this morning.

<p>
	Multiple Republican lawmakers — including Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who is Black, and Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) — called for Trump to remove the post. Scott, a close ally of the president, <a href="https://x.com/votetimscott/status/2019784005852242083">described the video</a> as the “most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House.”</p>



<p>
	The video featuring the Obamas was part of a bizarre string of posts from the president, many of which promoted unfounded election conspiracy theories. Trump also shared a 14-second <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116021666129349884">video</a> of a dog sliding itself into a kitchen at the sound of an aerosol whipped-cream can, and a 15-second <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116021671379958455">video</a> of Bruce Lee set to a dramatic rendition of the “Seven Nation Army” melody.</p>

<p>SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — Katie Paris opened a “Unite for Springfield” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Acos_KrMJfQ">Zoom gathering of more than 4,000 people</a> earlier this week by asking participants to share one thing in the chat that was giving them hope. </p>



<p>“Times are heavy. The subject we are discussing tonight is heavy. We’re in a heavy moment. It is so important in these times to tap into a sense of hope,” the mother of two said, sitting in front of a colorful wall displaying her children’s artwork. </p>



<p>“One thing that’s giving you hope right now, okay, let’s turn on the chat. Let’s see them,” Paris prompted.</p>

<p>“My children.” <br>“Minnesotans.”<br>“Community.” <br>“Family.” <br>“Decency.” <br>“Grandchildren.” <br>“<a href="https://19thnews.org/2026/01/minneapolis-protesters-rally-ice-schools-children/">Liam Ramos</a>.”</p>



<p>Red Wine &amp; Blue, an organization that Paris founded in 2019 to build a diverse “sisterhood” of suburban women to fight political extremism, hosted the call just hours before Tuesday night’s slated expiration of Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, an immigration designation that has allowed some 350,000 Haitians to live and work legally in the country. Springfield, a central Ohio city of 60,000 where as many as one in four residents are Haitian, was <a href="https://19thnews.org/2026/01/ice-churches-children-springfield-ohio/">bracing for an influx of federal immigration enforcement officers</a> akin to the Trump administration’s violent crackdown in Minnesota. Paris, who lives outside of Cleveland, about a three-hour drive northeast of Springfield, tempered the hopeful tone at the start of the meeting with political reality. </p>



<p>“Last night, a <a href="https://19thnews.org/2026/01/ice-churches-children-springfield-ohio/">federal judge blocked the Trump administration</a> from ending Temporary Protected Status for Haitians living and working legally in America, and the fight is far from over. The Department of Homeland Security immediately stated that they are <a href="https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/2018502877321334812">taking the case to the U.S. Supreme Court</a>, and we know what that means: With this Supreme Court, Haitians could lose their status in really a matter of weeks,” Paris said. </p>



<p>“We’re going to talk about what’s next legally in all this, we’re going to talk about what we can learn from Minneapolis, and we’re also going to talk about how we can stay safe. Finally, perhaps most importantly of all, we are going to be giving you opportunities to take real action tonight,” she continued.</p>



<p><a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/06/older-women-front-and-center-in-no-kings-pro-democracy-movement/">Women have been leading</a> <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/11/ohio-women-trump-remove-the-regime-protest/">the opposition</a> to <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/10/kendra-sullivan-no-kings-protest-rural-west-virginia/">Donald Trump’s second presidency</a>, playing key roles in resistance efforts and <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/08/free-dc-women-founded-movement-trump-military-takeover/">forming groups to counter</a> the administration’s policies on immigration and more. During the 2024 campaign, Trump repeatedly targeted the Haitians in Springfield with lies — as did now Vice President JD Vance, an Ohioan — to bolster his calls for a crackdown on even legal immigration. The president said he would “protect” women from immigrants, “<a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/10/trump-rally-protector-women/">whether the women like it or not</a>,” despite polls showing that women did not rank immigration among their top concerns, <a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/11/abortion-election-roe-harris-trump/">nor did they trust Trump the most</a> on the issue. </p>



<p>A PBS News/NPR/Marist Poll released Thursday showed that <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/poll-nearly-two-thirds-of-americans-say-ice-has-gone-too-far-in-immigration-crackdown">nearly two-thirds of Americans</a> now believe Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, has gone too far in its methods after federal agents killed Renee Nicole Good and <a href="https://19thnews.org/2026/01/alex-pretti-minneapolis-ice-shooting/">Alex Pretti</a> in Minneapolis. When <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NPR_PBS-News_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_202602021147.pdf">broken down by gender</a>, just 26 percent of women said they approved of how ICE was doing compared to 40 percent of men, the poll showed.</p>



<p>Paris, who <a href="https://www.leapambassadors.org/ambassadors/paris/">worked in national politics</a> before moving back to her husband’s hometown from Washington, D.C., founded Red Wine &amp; Blue to harness the political power of suburban women, a rapidly diversifying group that determines the outcome of elections — and often votes with different priorities on their minds than men do. </p>

<p>“It was really my reaction to the 2018 election and seeing all these women, particularly in the suburbs, become involved in politics for the very first time as a result of the 2016 election,” she said in an interview after the organizing call. “I knew that we needed to keep them engaged, and women are not always taken as seriously as I believe they should be.”</p>



<p>The Ohio chapter was Red Wine &amp; Blue’s first, followed by chapters in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Michigan — all critical states in presidential elections. There is also a national network of “Trouble Nation” groups for women living outside of those four states. Red Wine &amp; Blue now has more than 600,000 members and a staff of about 60. Its members and affiliated groups held 4,000 events last year, most of them in person. </p>

<p>The opportunity for action during Tuesday night’s Zoom came in a series of requests for donations for Springfield groups supporting Haitian families. Participants heard from <a href="https://19thnews.org/2026/01/ice-churches-children-springfield-ohio/">local pastor Carl Ruby</a>, whose congregation includes Haitians and is vocal about supporting them; Catholic <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/12/springfield-ohio-haitian-family-separation/">charity leader Casey Rollins,</a> who has urged Haitian parents to get passports and documents for their U.S.-born children in case of deportation or separation; Viles Dorsainvil, director of the nonprofit Haitian Community Help and Support Center; and legal experts who advised them on their rights and precautions to take when documenting ICE activity. Minneapolis-based Rev. Ashley Horan also joined to talk  about how her community <a href="https://19thnews.org/2026/02/minnesota-mutual-aid-caregiving-ice-resistance/">stepped up to care for their immigrant neighbors</a>. </p>



<p>In between speakers, Paris reminded those on the call — the vast majority were women and many were Ohioans, or had connections to Ohio or to Haiti, or a mix of those — that the way to help this time was to give money, and to do it fast. “We’re not going to keep this donate page up for long because we do need to get these funds in the hands of these organizations quickly — they are providing such urgently needed services on the ground,” she said. </p>



<p>The chat lit up again as the participants donated as little as $10 and as much as a $10,000 match.</p>



<p>“Donated.”<br>“Donated.”<br>“Donated again.”</p>



<p>In less than an hour, Red Wine &amp; Blue surpassed its fundraising target for the evening, collecting more than $107,000 for local groups supporting Springfield’s Haitian residents.</p>



<p>Red Wine &amp; Blue focuses on what Paris describes as “friend-to-friend” organizing; it does not spend money on expensive television ad campaigns or anonymous phone-banking efforts. Third-party analysis that matched Red Wine &amp; Blue’s contacts to voter files showed that their on-the-ground organizing increased turnout by 5 percent in even years and 8 to 11 percent in odd years. Paris said that a recent membership analysis showed that 54 percent of their members are current or former political independents or Republicans. </p>



<p>She gave the group its name — no wine consumption is required for membership, by the way — because she is “all about leaning into the tropes” that are put on women to “regain our political power.”</p>



<p>“They called us the ‘suburban housewives’ in 2020. We’ve been the ‘Chardonnay Antifa.’ Now they’re saying the ‘wine moms’ are paid protesters. We’ve been ‘soccer moms’ and ‘Zoom moms.’ I think <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTk4XYNDUYW/">all of that is meant to reduce us</a>, as a group of women who actually do have political power,” Paris said. </p>



<p>After a Fox News columnist <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-impeding-federal-law-enforcement-not-protest-its-just-crime">wrote last month</a> that “organized gangs of wine moms” were using “Antifa tactics” to oppose ICE, Red Wine &amp; Blue fired back on social media: “Add it to the very long list of names they’ve called us. They can try to scare us, they can try to shame us… but we’re still showing up, still supporting our communities.”</p>



<p>After the Zoom call, Paris said, “People are already getting their protest signs ready for the next ‘No Kings’ Day, saying: Red Wine &amp; Blue, the original ‘wine moms.’”</p>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt; Commemorating the 50th anniversary of Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver, this article explores the film's enduring legacy as a study of urban alienation and toxic masculinity. It examines Travis Bickle's roots in European existentialism and 1970s American sociopolitical decline, while noting how the film’s themes of resentment and isolation find new parallels in today's digital culture.&lt;/p&gt;

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Commemorating the 50th anniversary of Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver, this article explores the film's enduring legacy as a study of urban alienation and toxic masculinity. It examines Travis Bickle's roots in European existentialism and 1970s American sociopolitical decline, while noting how the film’s themes of resentment and isolation find new parallels in today's digital culture.</p>

    <p>Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver turns 50 this month. Nominated for four Oscars and winner of the Palme d’Or at the 1976 Cannes Festival, Scorsese’s searing, hallucinatory portrait of urban alienation is <a href="https://www.afi.com/afis-100-years-100-movies-10th-anniversary-edition/">widely regarded</a> as one of the most important American films of all time. </p>

<p>It is also unquestionably one of the most troubling.</p>

<p>Taxi Driver channels the anger, paranoia and alienation of an American decade shaped by economic decline, imperialist violence and political scandal. Set in the dilapidated squalor of a rapidly <a href="https://jacobin.com/2018/01/new-york-gentrification-real-estate-deindustrialization">deindustrialising</a> New York, the film proffers a forlorn portrait of a society coming apart at the seams. </p>

<p>At its heart sits a deeply unsettling vision of masculinity, bound up in racism and misogyny.</p>

<p>The social and psychological forces Taxi Driver brought into focus have not disappeared. If anything, they have simply migrated – finding new expression in digital cultures shaped by the <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-the-word-incel-got-away-from-us-255109">platforming of grievance</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/opinion/right-wing-masculinity-culture.html">aesthetised resentment</a> and the <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/celebrity/article/andrew-tate-toxic-masculinity-money-wealth-kshgkwb36">monetisation of male rage</a>. </p>

<h2>American existentialism</h2>

<p>Travis Bickle (portrayed with unnerving intensity by Robert De Niro) was the creation of screenwriter Paul Schrader, who drew heavily on his own experiences of isolation and emotional crisis. Schrader also looked to literature for inspiration, citing Fyodor Dostoevsky’s misanthropic <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49455.Notes_from_Underground">Underground Man</a> as a formative influence. </p><div>
<div>
  <h5></h5>
  <button></button>
</div>
</div>

<p>In placing the European existential hero in an American context, <a href="https://www.filmcomment.com/article/paul-schrader-richard-thompson-interview/">said Schrader</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you find that he becomes more ignorant, ignorant of the nature of his problem. Travis’ problem is the same as the existential hero’s, that is, should I exist? But Travis doesn’t understand that this is his problem, so he focuses it elsewhere: and I think that is a mark of the immaturity and the youngness of our country. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Schrader also drew on contemporary events, including the attempted assassination of right-wing politician <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-C-Wallace">George Wallace</a> by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Assassinations-and-assassination-attempts-involving-U-S-presidents-and-presidential-candidates">Arthur Bremer</a>. The result was a character who crystallised the violent confusions of the era.</p>

<p>Like Bremer, Travis keeps a diary. We see him writing in it at various points in the film and we hear excerpts from it in voiceover:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the animals come out at night. Whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal. Someday a real rain’ll come and wash all this scum off the streets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Travis, a decidedly unreliable narrator who claims to have served in Vietnam, takes a job as a taxi driver because he has trouble sleeping. Working almost exclusively at night and wound impossibly tight, he rides through the city in a state of heightened unease. </p>

<p>One morning, after clocking off from a long shift, he notices a young woman through the window of a midtown Manhattan office. This is Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), an ambitious campaign worker employed by a presidential hopeful Charles Palentine (Leonard Harris). </p>

<p>Betsy quickly becomes the object of Travis’s fixation. He begins loitering in his cab outside her workplace, watching her from a distance. Eventually, he somehow persuades her to go on a date with him. It does not go well. </p>

<p>Socially inept, Travis’ idea of a good time is a trip to a Times Square porno theatre. He appears genuinely baffled when Betsy decides she has had enough and storms out, cutting off all contact with him. This only deepens Travis’ indignation and culminates in an angry confrontation at Betsy’s office, where he berates her in front of her coworkers.</p>

<p>Travis starts to spiral, confessing to a fellow cabbie that he’s got “some bad ideas” in his head. He settles on a plan of action. His diary entries become even more ominous.</p>

<p>He starts working out obsessively, loads up on guns and plots the public assassination of Betsy’s boss. Political violence becomes a way of giving shape to his discontent, transforming indignation into a pipe dream of historical consequence. He practices shooting in front of the mirror in his dingy apartment. </p>

          </figure>

<p>De Niro’s improvised line, “You talkin’ to me”, became (to borrow from film scholar <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28408.Taxi_Driver">Amy Taubin</a>) “arguably the most quoted scene in movie history”. </p>

<p>When his plan to murder Palantine collapses, Travis redirects his attention to Iris, a 12-year-old sex worker played by Jodie Foster. He decides he must “help” her get away from her pimp, believing himself morally just. Carnage ensues – so ferocious that it <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/martin-scorsese-taxi-driver-apple-tv-b2839879.html">initially led</a> to the film being refused a commercial rating.</p>

<p>It ends on a bleakly ironic, ambiguous note.</p>

<h2>A dark afterlife</h2>

<p>Taxi Driver <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1976/02/09/taxi-driver-movie-review-pauline-kael">divided</a> <a href="https://www.filmcomment.com/article/the-power-the-gory-martin-scorsese-taxi-driver-manny-farber-patricia-patterson/">critics</a> but proved an immediate hit with viewers. </p>

<p>Its disquieting power did not diminish with time; if anything, the film’s afterlife has been almost as troublesome as the work itself. </p>

<p>In 1981, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-W-Hinckley-Jr">John Hinckley Jr.</a> – who had become obsessed with the film – attempted to assassinate Ronald Reagan in an effort to impress Jodie Foster. This incident <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt36998986/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_accord_1_cdt_t_1">shook Scorsese</a>, who briefly considered giving up filmmaking altogether.</p>

<p>Travis Bickle has been repeatedly elevated to the status of anti-hero. The character has cast a long cultural shadow, most obviously in Todd Phillips’s Joker (2019).</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt36998986/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_accord_1_cdt_t_1">2025 documentary series</a> reflecting on Scorsese’s career returns to this question of legacy. Director Rebecca Williams puts it to Schrader that she gets the impression that “there are a lot of Travis Bickles, especially right now.” Schrader’s reply is blunt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They’re all talking to each other on the internet. When I first wrote about him, he was talking to nobody. He really was, at that point, the Underground Man. Now he’s the Internet Man. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a sobering thought.</p>

        <div>
<p>PROVO, Utah — The capital murder case against the man accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk is in its early stages, but conspiracy theories about Kirk’s death are already shaping the court proceedings.</p>



<p>Utah prosecutors allege 22-year-old Tyler Robinson shot and killed the CEO of Turning Point USA at a September event on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem — an assassination in broad daylight, witnessed by thousands in person and millions more online. The state says it has compelling evidence in its case against Robinson, including the murder weapon, DNA, bullet casings, security camera footage, text messages and other electronic communications. And, according to the state, Robinson has confessed.</p>



<p>But online, <a href="https://t.co/tK8LsDwW3X">alternative theories</a> and the ham-fisted investigations behind them have taken over. Conspiracist influencers, podcasters and gossip vloggers, armed with little credible evidence to support their claims, have flooded social platforms and fringe media channels with unfounded theories. They claim Robinson was a patsy, framed or possibly controlled by shadowy actors, including, Israel; the U.S. government; Turning Point USA; or even Kirk’s widow, Erika, who took over the organization after his death.</p>



<p>The theories are evolving week to week, as wannabe detectives online draw spurious connections between powerful groups and the flight logs of private planes, unverified reports from anonymous tipsters and video of Kirk’s killing and the aftermath, collected from dozens of angles, spliced and dissected to paint the picture of a coordinated plot.</p>



<p>Robinson’s trial is months away, but these alternative narratives are already seeping into the courtroom.</p>



<p>At a pretrial hearing Tuesday to determine whether state prosecutors should be removed from the case over an alleged conflict of interest, Robinson appeared in a lilac tie and shackles. A pair of conspiracist YouTubers sat on benches directly behind his parents, alongside members of the general public and a few dozen journalists, including this one.</p>



<p>Cross-examining a state agent about the scope of the investigation, defense attorney Kathy Nester asked whether investigators had looked into the alternative theories surrounding the shooting, including online videos claiming the existence of additional shooters.</p>



<p>“These videos have been used far and wide to look to see if there were potentially other shooters in the crowd,” Nester told Bureau of Investigation Agent Dave Hall. “Have you seen this on social media? Thousands of them?”</p>



<p>“Are you aware,” she continued, “that the videos taken from the scene have been analyzed by people on social media and in the press to see if there was somebody else that could have been involved in this?”</p>



<p>“I’m aware that everybody has a theory on the case,” Hall replied.</p>



<p>“Everybody has a theory on it, right?” Nester said. ”Whether those theories are good or bad, or whether your theory is good or bad … you guys should at least take a look at them. Fair?”</p>



<p>Her line of questioning suggests that these outside theories could play a significant role in the case going forward. They’ve already been invoked by multiple parties, at hearings and in pretrial motions, to sway Judge Tony Graf in one way or another. Robinson’s defense cited them as a reason to restrict public access to the proceedings, and by Erika Kirk — as well as lawyers representing a consortium of media — as a reason to make them more public.</p>



<p>The defense asked that video and still cameras be barred, claiming that biased media coverage could unfairly affect Robinson’s right to a fair trial. The state objected to the motion. </p>



<p>“Speculation and misinformation have already developed in the absence of full public access to courtroom proceedings,” prosecutors wrote. “When the public cannot observe testimony, rulings, and evidentiary context directly, narratives inevitably fill the vacuum.”

<p>For months, Erika Kirk has been targeted by online mobs alleging her complicity in her husband’s killing — bizarre claims that Turning Point USA has countered with public denials and cease-and-desist letters. On Monday, Kirk invoked the conspiracy theories in her own court filing, asking Graf not to limit public access to the proceedings.</p>



<p>“Public attention cannot be ignored,” Kirk wrote. Without access, she continued, the public won’t be able to see the evidence for themselves, and “in the absence of transparency, speculation, misinformation and conspiracy theories are likely to proliferate, eroding public confidence in the judicial process.”</p>



<p>In court Tuesday, Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray seemed to acknowledge that public speculation — if not the conspiratorial claims surrounding the case — had already influenced the case. He said from the witness stand that the state’s decision to seek the death penalty, announced just days after Kirk’s killing, had been driven in part by a desire to head off such gossip.</p>



<p>Gray said earlier cases had taught him that delaying such decisions only created “unnecessary public speculation” and “unnecessary angst with families of victims.”</p>



<p>“I wanted to shut that out,” Gray said.</p>



<p>It seems clear, though, that the fevered speculation will continue.</p>



<p>Conspiracist creators livestreamed Tuesday’s hearing, and within hours, had cut clips from the proceedings into fresh content for their eager audiences. One prominent creator on X called his latest video: “Patsy Plot Unravels.”</p>



<p>A preliminary hearing is scheduled for May, when the state will present evidence and a judge will decide whether the case goes to trial. In the meantime, the conspiracy theories will keep spreading online, and may continue to affect the case.</p>

        <div><div><p>There is an art to a proper meat pie, according to the Seattle chef and butcher Kevin Smith. The American pot pie frustrates him because it lets the pot do the heavy lifting. “The real way of doing it, for me, is to make a freestanding pie,” Smith says. The pastry should hold itself up, a technique cooks in England have honed over centuries. “That is so much more theatrical.”</p></div><div><p>Those meat pies — densely packed with beef shank in Guinness gravy, or chile tinged-lamb korma — anchor the menu at <a href="https://beastandcleaver.com/the-little-beast/">Little Beast</a>, Smith’s new English pub. For Smith, who also runs the butcher shop <a href="https://beastandcleaver.com/">Beast and Cleaver</a> and the restaurants the Peasant and the Beastro inside it, the venture marks a return to his South London upbringing. “It’s very, very classic English food,” he says. Both London and Seattle can be cold, gray, and gloomy. In both cities, one needs food that “warms the bones,” he says, and coziness is the impulse of the moment.</p></div><div><p>Smith’s goal is to truly recreate a quintessential English pub. This, to him, meant rustic, a little dark, not at all fancy — just the kind of place where people can “come in and sling their coat over the back of a chair,” Smith says. So far, his homey pub has been a hit: Eater Seattle named Little Beast its <a href="https://seattle.eater.com/restaurant-news/89523/eater-awards-winners-seattle-2025">Restaurant of the Year</a> in 2025.</p></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://platform.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/Eater_Lords_051.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,8.3333333333333,100,83.333333333333"><img alt="a spread of dishes at lord’s including crispy pig’s head served with radicchio, a scotch egg, and welsh rarebit. in the background, a diner grips a bottle of worcestershire sauce." src="https://platform.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/Eater_Lords_051.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=2400"></a></div></div></div><div><figcaption>Lord’s serves dishes like a curried lamb Scotch egg, Welsh rarebit topped with anchovies, and crispy fried pig’s head</figcaption> <cite>Photo by Jutharat ‘Poupay’ Pinyodoonyachet</cite></div></div></div></div><div><p>It’s no longer time to speculate whether the British are coming; they’re very much here. Like Little Beast, British-style pubs and country restaurants are cropping up across the United States, with hotspots including <a href="http://wildesla.com/">Wilde’s</a> in Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.dinglespublichouse.com/">Dingles Public House</a> in San Francisco, <a href="https://thebellnola.com/">the Bell</a> in New Orleans (“an easygoing neighborhood joint with an English accent”), and <a href="https://thechumleyhouse.com/">the Chumley House</a> in Fort Worth, Texas. In Chicago, the new <a href="https://piccadillymktpub.com/">Piccadilly Pub</a> fashions itself as a “neighborhood chippy,” and in Philadelphia, the chef Ange Branca, whose Malaysian restaurant Kampar has been closed since last February due to a fire, recently ran <a href="https://www.instagram.com/modspuds">Mod Spuds</a>, a pop-up <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/food/mod-spuds-jacket-potato-kampar-20251210.html">that served</a> loaded English “jacket potatoes.”</p></div><div><p>In New York City, chef Ed Szymanski has built some of the city’s most solid new restaurants around his own homesickness, including the English seafood restaurant <a href="https://www.damenewyork.com/">Dame</a> and the meatier “English bistro” <a href="https://www.lordsenglish.com/">Lord’s</a>; chef Jess Shadbolt <a href="https://ny.eater.com/news/404553/deans-nyc-british-seafood-restaurant-opening-2026-king-jess-shadbolt-annie-shi">will soon unveil Dean’s</a>, a British seafood restaurant inspired by her seaside hometown. And recently, sticky toffee pudding, one of England’s most popular desserts, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/t-magazine/sticky-toffee-pudding.html">has also served as a major source of inspiration</a> for pastry chefs across the country.</p></div><div><p>It’s natural for any cuisine that’s been maligned in the global sphere to want a redemption arc, and for so long, British food has been the butt of jokes: mushy, beige, brown, bland — the kind of sadness that writer Aisling McCrea <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8586/why-is-british-food-so-bad">once ascribed</a> to British people being “too repressed to cook food correctly.” For rising star NYC pastry chef Lilli Maren Beard, who grew up in London, the goal of her work is updating British pastry classics “so that they’re actually good,” as she puts it on her Substack publication <a href="https://lillimaren.substack.com/">The Buttery</a>. “I think the [bad] reputation comes from the pure fact that British food has to be tasted: It’s food that’s meant to be eaten, not to be looked at,” Beard says. Beige and brown mush is “bad PR” for its “beautiful flavors.”</p></div><div><p>Now, young chefs like herself, Beard says, are having a “similar journey” of realizing the “trove” of delicious food in their history and wanting to show it off with personality, a sense of humor, and, yes, better visuals, too.</p></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://platform.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/Eater_Seattles_Best_Restaurants_The_Little_Beast_Brooke_Fitts022-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,8.3333333333333,100,83.333333333333"><img alt="a thick meat pie filled with lamb korma sits on a white plate. it’s covered in gravy, which surrounds the pie on the plate, and topped with two red chile peppers." src="https://platform.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/Eater_Seattles_Best_Restaurants_The_Little_Beast_Brooke_Fitts022-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=2400"></a></div></div></div><div><figcaption>One of chef Kevin Smith’s signature dishes at Little Beast is the lamb korma pie</figcaption> <cite>Photo by Brooke Fitts</cite></div></div></div></div><div><p>Follow a few young British chefs on social media and you’ll quickly start to wonder why the cuisine has a bad name. Through short-form videos, places like Manchester’s <a href="https://ondapastabar.com/">Onda Pasta Bar</a> (of viral “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CxNsIMItuAx/?hl=en">tiramisu drawer</a>” fame) and London’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fallowrestaurant/reels/#">Fallow</a> have become <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/skin-game-media_marketing-contentstrategy-brandbuilding-activity-7384214536288985088-XQkH">as much media brands</a> as they are restaurants. From chefs-turned-creators, you’ll find bangers and mash that look undeniably delicious, roasted chickens swimming in luxurious drippings, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/C5BhbjbokN1/">gravy-filled meat pies</a> laden with so much butter that there’s no way they could be bad — lest we forget that butter <a href="/23132476/butter-tiktok-chef-thomas-straker">formed the foundation</a> of London chef Thomas Straker’s global ascent.</p></div><div><p>“These people are generally broadcasting to a British audience,” says the London-based restaurant critic Jonathan Nunn, who runs the publication <a href="https://www.vittlesmagazine.com/">Vittles</a>. Particularly, that’s “an East London, South London audience who are very plugged into what is going on in food culture internationally and what is going on in London restaurants, and wants to replicate those things in their homes in a way that doesn’t really look like dishes their parents made but are still recognizably British dishes.”</p></div><div><p>According to Nunn, this social media moment is British people hyping up British food for British people. That this might influence the perception of British food to non-British people “is just a byproduct of that.” As “strange” as it is to think of British food as “exotic,” he says, “I think Americans are fascinated by [British food] in the same way anyone would be fascinated by anything ‘exotic.’”</p></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://platform.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/Wildes_KortHavens_6.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100"><img alt="tk" src="https://platform.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/Wildes_KortHavens_6.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></div></div></div><div><figcaption>Fish and chips are a “core dish” for Natasha Price, executive chef and co-owner of Wilde’s</figcaption> <cite>Photo by Kort Havens</cite></div></div></div></div><div><p>Perhaps part of the appeal of British food in the U.S. right now is simply that it’s just different enough to be newly compelling. Fish sticks aren’t particularly en vogue, but good fish and chips? That pulls in an “<a href="/22549458/chef-ed-szymanski-fish-and-chips-seafood-restaurant-dame-nyc">overwhelming</a>” demand, as Szymanski learned during his pandemic pop-up. Lending an air of intrigue, it’s on the menu at Wilde’s as “battered skate &amp; mint.”</p></div><div><p>In recent years, American dining culture has largely been <a href="/24104963/french-bistro-brasserie-trend">filtered through the lens of the French bistro</a>, so maybe the rising English pub moment is an indicator that we’ve become bistro-ed out. The “new American” restaurant, the French bistro, and the modern English pub — these don’t offer wildly different food so much as they offer a sense of a change of environs. As concepts, they’re familiar enough to be easy, different enough to be destinations. “I think it’s very relatable [food],” Smith says, adding that “the food that people think is bad over here, as in English food, is actually what a lot of American food is based on.” Making British food for American audiences requires some concessions though: That’s why Lord’s also serves a Welsh rarebit <em>burger</em> and sticky toffee pudding <em>pancakes</em>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://platform.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/251100_GYMLV_Photo-Credit-AVABLU_Chicken-Butter-Masala.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100"><img alt="a small metal pot of butter chicken sits next to a basket of herb-topped naan on a marble tape at the restaurant gymkhana" src="https://platform.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/251100_GYMLV_Photo-Credit-AVABLU_Chicken-Butter-Masala.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></div></div></div><div><figcaption>Indian fine dining restaurant Gymkhana opened its first U.S. location in December</figcaption> <cite>Photo by AVABLU</cite></div></div></div></div><div><p>All this recent Anglophilia has yet to even touch on the incoming British imports.

While London’s contributions to the U.S. have historically centered around the kind of <a href="https://london.eater.com/venue/31418/st-john-bread-and-wine">St. John</a>-inflected nose-to-tail gastropub, as reflected in stateside openings Little Beast and Lord’s, Dishoom and Gymkhana represent the essential nature of British Indian food.</p></div><div><p>“That’s as part of modern British food culture as anything else,” Nunn says. “That kind of hybridity being accepted as part of British cuisine on a global level, and being recognized as such, is a good thing.”</p></div><div><div><form><div><div><h2>Eater Today</h2><p><span>The freshest news from the food world every day</span></p></div><div><fieldset><div><div><div><label>Email (required)</label><div><input></div></div></div><button><span>Sign Up</span></button></div></fieldset><div><div>By submitting your email, you agree to our<!-- --> <a href="https://www.voxmedia.com/legal/terms-of-use">Terms</a> and <a href="https://www.voxmedia.com/legal/privacy-notice">Privacy Notice</a>. <!-- -->This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google<!-- --> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> <!-- -->apply.</div></div></div></div></form></div></div><div><span>See More<!-- -->:<span> </span></span><ul><li><a href="/trends">Food and Restaurant Trends</a></li><li><a href="/dining-out">Dining Out</a></li></ul></div></div>

As an African American woman, West overcame huge barriers to contribute to this key technology. She was one of many women of her generation whose talents helped to propel the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01585-9">mid-twentieth-century cold-war technology</a> boom in the United States. Programming some of the most powerful computers of the time, West pushed the horizons of computation and communication. She has died, aged 95.</p><p>West was born in a farming family in rural Virginia. She excelled in her studies, but because of the Jim Crow laws that barred Black children from the well-funded schools that white students enjoyed, she attended a vocational-training school rather than an academically oriented secondary school. She earned a scholarship to Virginia State College, a historically Black college in Petersburg, where she was one of the few women to study mathematics. West obtained her master’s degree there in 1955.</p><p>West’s desire to find a profession that would open up possibilities for her propelled her to take up a position at a research and development centre, then called the Naval Proving Ground, Dahlgren, in Virginia. When she started, she was one of only two Black women and four Black professionals. The double burden of discrimination made West feel like an outsider among both the white women who worked at the centre — whose conversations, she recalled, would often fall silent as she approached — and her male co-workers. She was keenly aware that she should keep her head down and never “allude to the fact she had different ideas”. West was unable to travel with her colleagues because of segregation laws and missed out on opportunities as a result.</p><p><article><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04151-9"><img alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00254-z/d41586-026-00254-z_51974134.jpg"><p>These women helped to shape quantum mechanics — it’s time to recognize them</p></a></article></p><p>Moreover, secrecy sometimes hid the full impact of her work from her. “We didn’t know exactly where it was going because we worked for the military where everything is secret,” West recalled. Nevertheless, she embarked on research at the centre that shaped her later accomplishments. In 1962, West worked on Project 29V in the computational division’s scientific programming and analysis branch. Her job was to calculate the orbit of Pluto in relation to Neptune. She was part of a team that programmed a computer to perform more than five billion calculations, taking nearly 100 hours of computer time. Ultimately, in 1964, the work proved the regularity of Pluto’s orbit. The research won a merit award for group achievement.</p><p>West next took a job in the Defense Mapping Agency at Dahlgren. There, she managed the SEASAT radar altimetry project — a system for data collection and processing that would model Earth’s environmental and oceanographic features. Orbiting Earth from June to October 1978, the SEASAT satellite used cutting-edge technology to help researchers to create a model of the planet’s shape, measuring sea-ice levels, the oceans’ topography and other characteristics of Earth’s largest water bodies.</p><p>After this success, West and her team used data from a US Navy satellite called GEOSAT, launched in March 1985, to create a geodetic Earth model with improved accuracy. West used an IBM 7030 Stretch supercomputer to analyse these data, accounting for variations in gravitational and tidal forces that change Earth’s shape. Stretch was an intimidating machine: so big that it would take up “the first floor of a house”, West noted.</p></div>

<p>There was nothing special about the scenes from Edmonton: orderly lines of people in winter coats snaking across a snowy park, bare trees stark against a pale winter sky, the mundane choreography of civic participation playing out in a provincial capital most Americans couldn’t locate on a map.</p>

<p>Albertans queuing to sign a petition, even one to secede from Canada, could never compete for attention with the tragic, disorienting developments that filled the first long month of 2026: the ICE shooting in Minneapolis, Donald Trump’s bombastic threats to annex Greenland, and Canadian prime minister Mark Carney’s tense <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flsgJe8mN-A">warnings</a> from Davos about middle powers ending up “on the menu.” </p>



<p>But for those who’ve tracked how sovereignty collapses, these winter queues had an eerie resonance.<br><strong><br></strong>Almost as soon as he took office for his second term, Trump <a href="https://apnews.com/article/how-canada-could-become-us-state-42360e10ded96c0046fd11eaaf55ab88">began</a> calling Canada “the 51st state,” declaring that the country “only works” if it becomes part of the United States. He’d <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgx1ezpx52o">refuse</a> to use proper titles, referring to Canadian prime ministers as “Governor Trudeau” and later “Governor Carney.” He <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/article/trump-shares-altered-map-of-us-flag-covering-canada-greenland-and-venezuela/">posted</a> altered maps showing Canada as U.S. territory. It played as crude humor, vintage Trump bluster designed to dominate the news cycle and unsettle an ally he viewed as weak. But by January 2026, as Trump’s threats to annex Greenland dominated headlines, his drip-drip taunting of Canada had calcified into something concrete on the ground in Alberta, had given shape and momentum to a once low-key secessionist sentiment.</p>



<p>The Alberta Prosperity Project needs 177,732 signatures by May to trigger a referendum on secession from Canada. Their representatives claim they’ve made “repeated visits” to Washington to meet with senior Trump administration officials, meetings they say took place inside the kind of secure facility reserved for discussing classified intelligence. </p>



<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent publicly declared that Alberta should “come down into the U.S.” as a “natural partner.” Republican Congressman Andy Ogles <a href="https://x.com/cspotweet/status/2014058390817820969">told</a> the BBC that Albertans “would prefer not to be part of Canada and be part of the United States because we are winning day in and day out.” According to the separatists’ own materials, their vision includes a “common market” with the U.S., zero tariffs, adoption of the U.S. dollar and construction of two oil pipelines through American territory. Spokesperson Jeffrey Rath has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/11dc2140-6a5d-4536-b766-52c920affcc7">claimed</a> the U.S. would potentially provide a $500 billion line of credit to the newly independent Alberta.</p>

<h2><strong>Widening the Overton window</strong></h2>



<p>A referendum on Albertan secession, should it happen, appears almost certain to fail. Polls show only 24% of Albertans support joining the U.S., with 65% strongly opposed. Most media outside Canada has treated this as a fringe story. But the language being used by the Trump administration in support of secession is becoming a textbook example of how the Overton window shifts: say the outrageous thing, let it be dismissed as mischievous troublemaking, and then watch as domestic actors race to occupy the newly opened political space. Repeat until the “absurd” becomes debatable, and the debatable becomes negotiable. When a U.S. Treasury Secretary publicly advocates for a Canadian province to secede and join America, he’s not predicting the future — he’s manufacturing a present in which such conversations become possible. There’s no master plan; the chaos itself creates opportunity.</p>



<p>The timing matters. Mark Carney has emerged as the strongest voice pushing back against Trump’s increasingly aggressive rhetoric, most notably in his Davos speech warning that middle powers risk ending up “on the menu.” Daniel Béland, a political scientist at McGill University who studies Canadian federalism, sees Alberta separatism as potentially serving a strategic purpose for the Trump administration: “Mark Carney is standing up to Trump. We saw what happened in Davos, right? So maybe they see that what’s happening in Alberta is weakening both Canada and Carney.”</p>



<p>The reason this story matters has less to do with the petition itself than with the narrative infrastructure being built around it. Recently, the exiled Russian news agency Meduza <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2026/01/23/they-won-t-shut-up-about-greenland-meduza-obtains-the-kremlin-s-instructions-for-state-media-covering-trump-s-standoff-with-denmark">obtained</a> a manual that the Kremlin had distributed to state-owned and pro-government media outlets instructing them how to cover Trump’s Greenland standoff. The directives were explicit: emphasize that territorial expansion is what “strong countries” do, that Trump is “aiming for Vladimir Putin’s success,” that conflicts with European countries “will be forgotten, but the territories will remain.” Journalists were told to frame NATO as “collapsing” and Putin as “forcing America to engage in equal dialogue” while European leaders “halfheartedly protest on social media.”</p>



<p>For Russian and Chinese state outlets, <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/631704-canada-separatists-trump-administration/">coverage</a> of Albertan separatism is in keeping with the broad narrative that Western alliances are <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202601/1354158.shtml">fracturing</a> and sovereignty is negotiable for resource-rich regions. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, meanwhile, has spent the past year articulating what he calls a doctrine of “hemispheric defense,” framing Canada not as an ally but as territory that needs to be controlled. A “rapidly changing” Canada, he has said, in which 25% of the population is “foreign-born” means “these people are hostile to the United States of America.” Canada, Bannon <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15471249/Trump-Greenland-Canada-Donroe-Doctrine.html?ito=native_share_article-top">claims</a>, “is the next Ukraine.”</p>



<p>While Bannon has spoken extensively about hemispheric defence and Canada’s strategic value as a U.S. protectorate, there’s been no official movement towards such a goal — no Pentagon study, no Congressional authorization hearings, no legal pathway to annexation. Trump can troll, Bannon can theorize, Bessent can advocate, but no one appears to be seriously suggesting executing a plan. The damage isn’t in the doing, it’s in the destabilization, it’s in normalizing the conversation.</p>



<p>A parallel playbook doesn’t mean identical outcomes. There will be no little green men, no masked special forces in Calgary. But in 2014, when Russia entered Crimea, it wasn’t military occupation alone, it began with the systematic deployment of narratives that made annexation appear inevitable, even locally driven, before troops ever arrived. And now the Kremlin <a href="https://tass.com/politics/2078863">argues</a> hypocrisy when the United Nations Secretary General <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/press-events/2026-01-29/secretary-generals-press-conference-his-2026-priorities">says</a> the principle of the “self-determination of peoples has a number of requisites.” </p>



<h2><strong>Déjà vu</strong></h2>



<p>My view is shaped by what I’ve witnessed: Russian-backed separatists taking over my grandparents’ house in Abkhazia in the 1990s, years of reporting from South Ossetia before Russia seized it in 2008, and standing outside a Ukrainian military base in Perevalnoe in 2014, watching Russian soldiers in unmarked uniforms take control while Moscow denied they were even there.</p>



<figure><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABesAAASwAQMAAABRlYPzAAAAA1BMVEVHcEyC+tLSAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAPVJREFUeNrtwTEBAAAAwqD1T20KP6AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC+Bn99AAGkXWhmAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC" alt=""><noscript><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2230039771BBB-1515x1200.jpg" alt=""></noscript><figcaption>Map of Ukraine locating territories claimed by Russia (Including Crimea, which was annexed in 2014)  as of August 17, 2025.

<p>The annexation of Crimea showed how the ground for seizing sovereignty is laid through manufactured political theater. A politician whose party won 4% of the vote in 2010 was installed at gunpoint and held a referendum under occupation that reported 96.7% of people supported joining Russia. He’s still in charge.</p>



<p>Provinces and regions challenge sovereignty regularly. In Scotland’s 2014 referendum on whether it should be independent of the United Kingdom, nearly 45% voted ‘yes.’ Catalonia’s 2017 referendum saw 48% back independence from Spain before Madrid blocked it through force, both physical and legal. Quebec came within 1% of secession in 1995, a margin so narrow it prompted federal legislation defining how provinces could leave.</p>



<p>What distinguishes Alberta isn’t the referendum mechanism, it’s the involvement of a foreign power. In every previous case, challenges to sovereignty remained internal disputes. Spain’s government opposed Catalonia, but secessionists didn’t visit France to seek €500 billion in credit from the French government. Canada addressed Quebec’s grievances, but the U.S. Treasury Secretary at the time didn’t suggest that Quebec should “come down into the U.S.”</p>



<p>The overt encouragement of Albertan secession is without precedent among Western democracies. Canada faces provocation by a superpower neighbor whose cabinet officials actively encourage provincial secession, whose political figures meet separatist leaders in secure intelligence facilities, and whose state apparatus treats a G7 ally’s territorial integrity as negotiable. “This is something that, at least to my knowledge, is unprecedented,” says Béland, referring to US State Department meetings with Alberta separatists. </p>



<h2><strong>The architecture of erosion</strong></h2>



<p>The conditions in Alberta and Crimea are, of course, fundamentally different: no troops, no armed separatists, and Alberta is a democracy in which roughly 76% oppose joining the U.S., if not necessarily Albertan independence. What’s comparable though is the vocabulary being used in the U.S.: the systematic framing of sovereignty as conditional, resources as rightfully belonging to a more powerful neighbor, and local grievances as requiring external “solutions.” </p>



<p>The rhetorical architecture that made Crimea possible is now being constructed around Alberta. That architecture requires foundation stones, and Alberta has them. When the province joined Canada in 1905, Ottawa retained control of Alberta’s natural resources though Ontario and Quebec got to keep theirs. This inequity was corrected in 1930, but the resentment lingered. In 1980, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau imposed a 25% federal tax on Alberta’s oil and seized control of pricing. The backlash was fierce: unemployment soared, projects collapsed, and “let the eastern bastards freeze in the dark” became a rallying cry. Separatist movements have flared and faded for decades, always returning to the same core grievance: Alberta produces 90% of Canada’s oil, Canada sells 95% of it to the United States, yet Alberta feels like a resource colony for Eastern Canada’s benefit.</p>

<p>Russia exploited similar dynamics in Crimea: real economic marginalization, language politics, the feeling of being a colony for Kyiv’s benefit. External powers don’t create these grievances, but they weaponize them. And just as in Crimea, it’s indigenous populations raising the alarm first. The Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article-first-nation-launches-legal-action-against-potential-alberta/">filed</a> a lawsuit arguing that Alberta cannot hold a referendum without indigenous consent, and explicitly warning that a referendum “will enable foreign interference from the most powerful neighbor to the south.” In Crimea, the indigenous Tatar population boycotted the 2014 referendum and suffered systematic repression afterward.</p>



<p>Alberta’s premier, Danielle Smith, has walked a careful line, speaking about her desire to stay a part of Canada while defending the need to hold a referendum. She met Trump at Mar-a-Lago days before his inauguration last year, speaking of the “need to preserve our independence while we grow this critical partnership.” But when the referendum petition was approved, she framed it as a democratic duty: “You need to have a pressure-release valve on issues that people care about.” According to the Globe and Mail, Canadian defense officials have recently <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-military-models-canadian-response-to-hypothetical-american-invasion/">modeled</a> a U.S. invasion scenario for the first time in over a century: a theoretical planning exercise, not an operational war plan. The modeling assumed American forces would overcome Canadian positions in as little as 2 days, prompting examination of asymmetric responses: sabotage, drones, dispersed resistance. Officials stressed an invasion remains highly unlikely. But allies don’t conduct theoretical exercises in fratricide unless something fundamental has shifted.</p>



<h2><strong>The shifting burden</strong></h2>



<p>Stories matter. The current collapse of Europe’s post-Cold War security arrangement began with narratives that made that collapse imaginable.</p>



<p>From the mid-2000s, Russian state television started hosting marginal voices questioning Ukraine’s right to exist. In 2008, the Russian daily Kommersant <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/archive/putin-hints-at-splitting-up-ukraine">reported</a> that in a private meeting, Putin told George W. Bush that Ukraine was “not even a state” and that the Kremlin would be encouraging secession in both Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Six years of this rhetoric made Ukrainian sovereignty negotiable before a single soldier crossed the border.</p>



<p>Trump has spent over a year declaring Canada “only works” as part of the United States while his Treasury Secretary publicly advocates for Alberta’s secession and Bannon, whose finger is frequently firmly on MAGA’s pulse, calls the country “hostile” and “the next Ukraine.” Béland warns that the damage from this process extends beyond the referendum’s outcome: “Even if the ‘no’ wins, the remain side wins, and even if it’s an easy victory… having a referendum campaign is highly divisive in and of itself, and it opens the door to potential U.S. interference.”</p>



<p>Sovereignty doesn’t collapse with a single referendum. It erodes in the accumulation of moments when defending it appears unreasonable, when maintaining it requires constant <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/29/americas/canada-carney-trump-alberta-separatists-latam-intl">justification</a>, when the burden of proof shifts from those who would divide to those who would preserve.</p>

        <section><p>Nothing makes Americans want to gamble like the Super Bowl. Every year, the game is reliably the biggest day for sports betting: On platforms such as FanDuel and DraftKings, people are already putting money down on which team will win the opening coin toss, how long the national anthem will be, and what color of Gatorade will be used to douse the winning head coach.</p><p>Gambling on sports has become practically inescapable. Nearly half of American men ages 18 to 49 <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/27/nx-s1-5680145/sports-betting-callout">maintain</a> an active online sports-betting account, and Vegas odds have invaded telecasts and talk shows. During NFL games, sportsbook commercials now outnumber beer ads. Despite all of that, more than a third of adults still cannot legally gamble from home: Online sports betting remains banned in 18 states, including California and Texas.</p><p>But for the past year, thanks to a loophole, Americans have effectively been able to bet on sports no matter where they live. All they have to do is turn to prediction markets. Platforms such as Kalshi let people wager on lots of things: Who will win the Oscar for Best Actor? How much snow will New York City get this month? Prediction markets say that they are more akin to the stock market than gambling. Rather than betting on odds set by bookmakers, users trade contracts that pay out according to the outcome of a given event. This distinction may not mean much for someone betting on the Seahawks over the Patriots, but it does allow prediction markets to operate even in places where sports betting is illegal.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/10/sports-betting-kalshi-cftc/684689/">Read: The company making a mockery of state gambling laws</a></p><p>Now America is about to find out what it really looks like when sports betting takes over. Kalshi, one of the country’s biggest prediction markets, launched its sport-betting operation just two weeks before the 2025 Super Bowl. This year, Kalshi has already seen more than $167 million in bets on the game, and that number could conceivably crack <em>$1 billion</em>, Dustin Gouker, a gambling-industry analyst, told me. Some of the biggest traditional sportsbooks and fantasy-sports sites, recognizing a work-around to enter states where gambling remains illegal, are seizing the opportunity: Since September, FanDuel, DraftKings, Fanatics, PrizePicks, and Underdog have all launched their own prediction-market offerings.</p><p>In one sense, prediction markets are about a whole lot more than sports. Both Kalshi and its biggest rival, Polymarket, have turned prediction markets into big business by letting people wager on seemingly everything. As Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour put it in October, the company’s goal is to “financialize everything”—to let people bet on the outcome of virtually any event. By encouraging people to put their money where their mouth is, the thinking goes, prediction markets can forecast how the future will play out. Even if you’ve never placed a bet yourself, prediction markets’ odds about news and entertainment—not sports—<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/america-polymarket-disaster/685662/">are especially in your face</a>. Both CNN and CNBC recently announced partnerships with Kalshi to incorporate the site’s predictions into their news coverage; last month, the Golden Globes displayed Polymarket’s odds throughout its broadcast.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/america-polymarket-disaster/685662/">Read: America is slow-walking into a Polymarket disaster</a></p><p></p><p>Kalshi may let you bet on topics as wide-ranging as whether Iran’s supreme leader <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxkhameneiout/ali-khamenei-out/kxkhameneiout-akha">will stay in power</a> and who will win the <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxsurvivor/who-will-win-survivor/kxsurvivor-26dec31">next season of </a><a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxsurvivor/who-will-win-survivor/kxsurvivor-26dec31"><em>Survivor</em></a>, but sports account for <a href="https://closingline.substack.com/p/the-takeaway-kalshi-non-sports-volume">more than 90 percent</a> of all trading volume on the site. From mid-December to mid-January, wagers on college basketball alone exceeded trading on everything other than sports. The single biggest non-sports market during this stretch—about whom President Trump would nominate as chair of the Federal Reserve—drew less activity than Italian soccer. In an email, Jack Such, a Kalshi spokesperson, told me that the categories that dominate the platform fluctuate based on what’s in the news. “During the NFL season, we are heavily tilted towards sports,” he wrote. “During the 2024 election season, we were heavily tilted towards politics. It all depends on what events are top of mind for the public.” Even though politics was big on Kalshi during the most recent presidential election, that was before the site offered sports betting.</p><p>Sports make up a smaller proportion of wagers on Polymarket, which has also yet to fully launch in the United States (although some Americans likely still access it by using virtual private networks). “At this moment in time, the use case of prediction markets, at least in the United States, appears to be the expansion of sports betting,” Gouker said. “It’s hard to come to another conclusion.”</p><p>This covert expansion of sports betting is controversial. Several states are <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wsj.com/business/media/this-nfl-seasons-fiercest-rivalry-is-sports-betting-vs-prediction-markets-1952aa61?utm_sf_cserv_ref%3D8304333127%26utm_sf_post_ref%3D658601284%26mod%3De2fb%26fbclid%3DIwY2xjawPvZRpleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFCYTJhT0pNYk9tRXZGRnJuc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHqzaeIh55L4tx6i8rbd4LpFqSLsnwbZ7Mtn7VeSio8MdkhZ7jonAXYYHNElC_aem_urQNoCOtz4SBvWuTLNm5Uw&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1770167674627642&amp;usg=AOvVaw12FFcAO_7bhdTYnSNzndoG">suing</a> Kalshi for operating an unlicensed sports-betting platform, which they argue deprives them of tax dollars. But late last month, Michael Selig, the newly appointed head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates prediction markets, indicated that he intends to help grow the prediction-market industry. All of which suggests that, in the immediate term at least, prediction markets are likely to make sports betting an even more pervasive part of American life—potentially leading to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/legal-sports-gambling-was-mistake/679925/">devastating consequences</a>. Research suggests that avid sports bettors are at risk of depleting their household savings, declaring bankruptcy, and even committing intimate-partner violence.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/06/sports-betting-gambling-addiction/683042/">Read: ‘I’m treating guys who would never be caught dead in a casino’</a></p><p>Not all prediction markets, for their part, are likely to be content with staying de facto sports-betting sites. After all, Kalshi and Polymarket want to harness the wisdom of crowds to forecast all kinds of real-world events, not just sports outcomes. Despite Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan’s recent proclamation that prediction markets are “the most accurate thing we have as mankind right now,” these platforms have much to prove on that front. When most bets are on sports, it’s especially hard to see what value prediction markets add. The kind of information gained by thousands of bettors laying down four-legged parlays on a Tuesday-night NBA game does not have the same utility as a more accurate hurricane forecast or election prediction. Not all knowledge, in other words, is created equal.</p><p>Perhaps prediction markets are hoping that once sports betting gets users in the door, they’ll engage with the many other markets on offer. “I think they’ve really thought that sports would just be an entry point, and then everything else would start growing,” Gouker said. But that Kalshi will be able to interest its droves of sports bettors in other markets is by no means guaranteed. In fact, it seems at least equally plausible that people might just prefer betting on the Super Bowl to betting on whether the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates. “People who are making forecasts on political and social and scientific outcomes are possibly different from people who are betting on sporting events,” John Phillips, the CEO of Aristotle, the company that runs the prediction market PredictIt, told me. “There are some commonalities there, but I think it’s a different type of activity and it attracts a different type of trader.”</p><p>If the goal of Kalshi and other prediction markets is to create something with genuine financial utility and predictive power, that’s a big problem. But this won’t prevent them from making a boatload of money along the way.</p><div></div></section>
