At a rally in Detroit earlier this month, Donald Trump told the crowd that his upcoming speech at the World Economic Forum would tackle one of his core issues: affordability. But the address he delivered in Davos yesterday was not quite what he’d telegraphed.

In what my colleague David A. Graham described as a “stump speech,” the president strayed from that focus, roaming from Arctic defense to the Minnesota fraud scandal to the policies of “Sleepy” Joe Biden. When he returned to the topic of affordability, he claimed that grocery prices are “going down” (they’re not) and that drug prices have declined by “2,000 percent” (they haven’t). Although Trump campaigned on the economy, weak polling has recently spurred new plans to make life in America more affordable.

At one point, Trump plugged a plan to curb predatory lending practices by capping credit-card interest rates at 10 percent—but the deadline (proposed on Truth Social) for the policy to go into effect had passed the day before. Trump also used his speech to promote his plan to lower housing costs, which he recently unveiled in an executive order. The policy is aimed at preventing corporations from buying up single-family homes, and has bipartisan support. These proposals were a blip in his 80-minute speech before he quickly pivoted.

Trump has lately been laser-focused on foreign policy. Nearly three weeks ago, U.S. troops captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and brought him to New York for trial. Since then, Trump has flirted with military action in Iran and attempted to bully Denmark into giving up Greenland, threatening a sweeping new tariff strategy that—had Trump not reneged yesterday—could have raised costs for Americans.

When Trump and his officials have talked about the economy, their comments have been confusing. The White House’s insistence that consumer goods are, in fact, affordable has so far not connected with many Americans, for whom high prices are still top of mind. In an attempt to underscore how cheap supermarkets have supposedly become, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said last week that “it can cost around $3 a meal for a piece of chicken, a piece of broccoli, you know, a corn tortilla, and one other thing.” After being criticized online for appearing out of touch, she clarified that $15.64 was the more accurate figure, based on “almost 1,000 simulations,” for “three full square meals and a snack.” (I have some follow-up questions: What’s that “other thing”? And what constitutes a “square” meal?)

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also faced blowback from observers and Democratic politicians this week after suggesting in an interview that “mom and pop” homebuyers are snapping up “five, 10, 12 homes” for retirement. And at a rally in Ohio earlier today, Vice President Vance compared the American economy to a doomed enterprise: “You don’t turn the Titanic around overnight,” he said. Trump has blamed “bad public-relations people” for failing to sell his affordability message—but the problem could also have to do with these sorts of gaffes.

The president’s inconsistent messaging may play a role too. Before the holidays, he held a rally in Pennsylvania as part of his “affordability tour”—an effort to shift Americans’ perspectives on the economy. His address included a digression about why the Democrats’ emphasis on affordability was a “hoax,” how Representative Ilhan Omar “does nothing but bitch,” and why Americans don’t need so many pencils. His speech at the Detroit Economic Club included a few diversions but was overall more targeted. “The Trump economic boom has officially begun,” he said.

Trump is right that the economy is showing signs of health. Unemployment is low, and the stock market is on a tear. But these metrics don’t reveal the whole picture. The economy is adding fewer jobs even as inflation remains under control. The Atlantic contributing writer John Dickerson recently pointed out that “aggregate gains mask uneven distribution, and many workers really are seeing their purchasing power erode.” If Trump’s attempts to interfere with the Federal Reserve’s independence prove successful, they could unleash even more economic uncertainty. “Trump is hardly the first president to cherry-pick numbers and accentuate the positive,” Dickerson wrote. “But his argument is weak because he has to overcome people’s lived experience.”

Despite his constant jabs at his predecessor, Trump is in some sense following in Biden’s footsteps. “Bidenomics” fell flat as a slogan in part because Biden’s rosy view of the economy didn’t connect with voters facing ever-higher inflation. When Trump and his team aren’t shutting down criticism of the economy, they’re simply distracted. Neither communicates to Americans that their struggles are understood.

The Sciencewashing of Everyday Life

By Ellen Cushing

There’s a double helix in my local Sephora. It’s roughly the size and shape of a soda can, and it is accompanied by a placard referencing patents and peptides, as if in a science fair. It’s trying to sell me a hair mask.

Online, the company responsible for this display describes itself as a “biology-first haircare brand, powered by biotech.” It practices “biomimetic hairscience,” and, thanks to “a decade of complex research into the bioscience of hair,” has patented a peptide that repairs hair “at a molecular level across multiple types of bonds including polypeptide chains and disulfide bonds.” I have no idea what any of this means. The mask costs $75.

In 2026, it is possible to cover your body in science.

María-Elena Pombo has created “petroleum weavings,” turning threads made from oil into elaborate yarnlike wall hangings. Oil, she told us, has shaped her life. Her father, an oil engineer, met her mother after he moved to Cabimas, an oil town. Because of Venezuela’s oil wealth, Pombo, now 37 years old, studied for free at an excellent public university in Caracas.

For decades, all Venezuelans enjoyed the perks of living in a land where oil was a birthright. They could fill their cars for almost nothing. Education and other public services were heavily subsidized as well. Academics might argue over the wisdom of the state’s largesse. But people expected, at the very least, affordable gas as a material benefit from the nation’s abundance of oil.

President Trump’s military intervention in Venezuela this month was, in part, a bid to seize the source of this wealth. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world. Trump made no secret of his desire to exploit them in what many have criticized as an act of naked imperialism and the theft of Venezuela’s economic patrimony: “We’re going to be using oil, and we’re going to be taking oil,” Trump said in an interview after the January 3 attack that captured the strongman President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.

Yet many Venezuelans in the country and abroad celebrated the strike. María Corina Machado, the popular leader of the opposition, has welcomed Trump’s actions. Last February, Machado was a guest on Donald Trump Jr.’s podcast. When he asked why Americans should care about Venezuela, her first response was: “Oil and gas.” Machado’s strategy could appear to have been a devil’s bargain—tempting Trump with the prospect of petrodollars in exchange for ousting Maduro, her nemesis. But her feelings reflected something broader, too: Venezuelans who once viewed oil as a source of wealth and pride, a limitless resource that had shaped their identity and set their country apart from its poorer neighbors, have come to view it more as a curse.

Venezuelans in the past two decades have watched as the regime squandered the wealth that oil had created, let the country’s oil infrastructure rot, removed gasoline subsidies, and welcomed a bigger hand from Cuba, bartering oil for professionals and intelligence operatives from Havana. Pombo says her generation is the last that benefited from oil. Today, the university where she studied is in such a sorry state that the roof of one of its buildings collapsed. In the former boomtown of Cabimas, in northwestern Venezuela, people grew so desperate that they jury-rigged refineries in their own backyards because gasoline had become so scarce and expensive.

By that measure, ceding the oil industry to the United States at least holds the promise of importing industrial know-how with some financial benefit for the country. A poll by The Economist found that a majority of Venezuelans “somewhat” or “strongly” supported the capture of Maduro and were optimistic about their economic prospects. Fewer than 35 percent thought that the Venezuelan government should continue running Venezuela’s oil industry. Or as Sary Levy-Carciente, Machado’s economic adviser, put it to us, the Americans will be “better clients.”

At a ranch in Cabimas one day in 1922, local farmers were awoken by a bang followed by a black rain. Workers for Shell, an Anglo-Dutch company, had been poking holes in the ground, looking for oil—and struck it rich. A plume spouted for many days. Some viewed the discovery as a divine gift, while a local priest chastised the explorers for unearthing Satan, saying the blowout was God’s punishment. Word traveled northward, and the Rockefellers of Standard Oil and the Mellons of Gulf Oil saw a business opportunity. The episode ushered in more than a half century of relative prosperity.

Even then, some saw signs of trouble. In the 1930s, Arturo Úslar Pietri, an influential intellectual and historian, argued in an essay that the country needed to “sow the oil” by investing oil profits to cultivate other industries. Generation after generation of schoolchildren have heard these words repeated as advice that the country should have followed but didn’t. Instead of sowing the oil, Venezuela became dependent on it.

American companies arrived to drill the wells and build the fields. They brought with them country clubs and baseball. The companies made deals with whichever military despot was in power in Caracas, angering young intellectuals such as Rómulo Betancourt, who harbored dreams of a democratic Venezuela. In his writings, he condemned “the aggressive, juvenile impetus of North American capitalism” and advocated for Venezuelans to be the owners of their oil.

Betancourt became president through a coup in 1945, putting him in position to fulfill his goal of a democratic constitution. But he exercised caution over oil. He didn’t kick out the Americans but instead persuaded them to pay more. He then used those proceeds to build schools, hospitals, and roads. Starting in 1948, American companies extracted the oil and gave roughly half of the profits to the Venezuelan state, an arrangement known as el fifty-fifty.

Betancourt’s stance that Venezuela resented America but needed America is reflected in Miguel Otero Silva’s 1961 novel, Oficina No. 1. The story follows pious, rural Venezuelans who leave everything behind to move to a nameless town where newly arrived Americans are extracting oil with little foresight or planning. The Trinidadian driver who takes the Venezuelans to the fields sings a song in English, as if warning about the type of people the Americans are: “After Johnny eats my food, / After Johnny drinks my rhum, / After Johnny wears my clothes, / Johnny comes back and takes my wife.” But the Venezuelans pay him no mind. They moved to a town with no name because that was their best hope.

Yet many Venezuelans idealize this period. The years of el fifty-fifty were some of the most prosperous in Venezuelan history—a time when migrants were eager to come to Venezuela, rather than leave it, as they have in droves more recently. Hundreds of thousands from Europe and elsewhere arrived for the glorious tropical climate, golden Caribbean beaches, and plentiful job opportunities. The possibilities felt limitless. The country built some of the world’s most futuristic highways and was early in eradicating malaria. When Christian Dior decided to open his first shop in Latin America, he opened it in Caracas. The Concorde, that majestic superfast airplane, flew in at least once a week. Oil was the draw that brought the world to Venezuela. Even Venezuela’s shanties were made with solid construction materials such as brick and concrete, made cheap by a strong bolivar, Venezuela’s currency. It was not uncommon to see new cars parked outside. And although the Venezuelan poor could not afford the shopping trips that the country’s rich made to Miami, they could go to Margarita—a Venezuelan island famous for its beaches and low tax rates.

By 1976, however, Venezuela’s political class had tired of el fifty-fifty. The government seized the assets of American companies and nationalized the oil industry, creating a state-owned giant Petróleos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA.

For years, the company thrived. José Guerra, a Venezuelan economist, told us that graduates aspired to land PDVSA jobs. (He didn’t make the cut as a young man, and had to settle for a job at the central bank.) The government funded scholarships so that the best and brightest could study abroad and become PDVSA engineers and managers. For Luis Soler, who worked at PDVSA for 30 years, the company represented a certain idea of meritocracy. It had an American-style work environment complete with 9-to-5 workdays and a corporate ladder for promotion. “We had discipline, values,” he said.

By the 1990s, PDVSA had become one of the largest and most influential state-owned oil companies in the world, second only to Aramco, its Saudi counterpart. Venezuelan leaders proved to themselves that they could competently manage the country’s oil.

Yet as Pietri had predicted more than a half century before, the country had failed to spread the wealth sufficiently to bolster other industries. “We just traded it! We traded it, and for what? Cars from the United States, whiskey from Scotland, fabrics from Italy, perfumes from France,” Rafael Quiroz, an oil economist at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas, told us. “And as time passed, we didn’t build anything. We didn’t use the oil to make an economy.”

Those outside the circle of PDVSA profits grew resentful. Seeds had been sown, but not for broad economic growth, as Pietri had once hoped, but for revolution.

The socialist Hugo Chávez came to power in 1999 and managed PDVSA for priorities other than maximum profits. He replaced thousands of highly trained company employees with party loyalists. And for the first decade of the 21st century, the state used oil as a tool of diplomacy, with Chávez lavishing petrodollars on tiny island nations whose votes he courted in the Organization of American States, a regional diplomatic forum. Venezuela replaced Russia as Cuba’s main oil supplier, a favor that Cuban President Fidel Castro returned by becoming Chávez’s mentor on authoritarianism. The consequences of the mismanagement were profound. A country that fully depended on oil became ill-equipped to produce it. After the oil boom, Venezuela somehow ended up poorer, beset by corruption and hyperinflation.

When Chávez died, in 2013, Maduro inherited a failing oil industry and did little to improve it. By 2020, Venezuela’s refineries had crumbled to the point that the country had to start importing gasoline from Iran. Even during the worst years of a humanitarian crisis, Maduro continued supplying his friends in the Cuban government with oil. (In January, the U.S. assault to capture Maduro killed 32 Cuban officers on the president’s security detail.) Venezuela now produces only about 1 percent of the oil in the world, a mere 1 million barrels a day.

The perception that Maduro gave away oil to keep himself in power has made some Venezuelans more comfortable with the idea of giving oil to America, the country that got rid of the strongman. “Venezuela is going from having a government controlled by Cuba to having a government controlled by the United States,” the historian Pedro Benítez told us, adding that the U.S. can help with the huge investments needed to revive the oil industry.

The rise of Machado is its own testament to changing attitudes about oil. Of all the opposition leaders, Machado has spoken most consistently in favor of privatization and foreign investment. For a long time, these preferences made her relatively unpopular. But in recent years, her views have spread widely. Many Venezuelans would have liked to see Machado replace Maduro as part of a transition back to democratic government. But so far, the Trump administration has shown little interest in that, preferring instead to work with Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro’s vice president, and the rest of the regime. Like Betancourt, she portrays the United States as an unwelcome imperial power: “Enough of Washington’s orders to Venezuelan politicians,” she said on Sunday. But when it comes to oil, she’s ready to deal. In a speech before legislators this month, she said that she would proceed with an “agenda of cooperation” nonetheless. “Let’s not be afraid of contradictions,” she said.

American companies are poised to develop Venezuela’s oil industry anew. Trump said this month that Venezuela would provide 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., and that the sale of this oil would “benefit the people” of both nations. Rodríguez said that Venezuela had received $300 million from the sale, the first payments from those barrels. She celebrated the country’s much-needed share of the revenue.

Trump sees a fresh era of American investment from the oil giants of today. He recently hosted the chief executives from the major U.S. oil firms at the White House to pitch them on the prospect. But the challenges are legion, including the need for political stability in both Venezuela and the U.S. There are no guarantees that a new American administration would take the same tack as Trump. And although working with the regime has brought its country near-term calm—Venezuela is secured right now by pro-government militias—the Trump administration has spoken about an eventual political transition. This leaves Caracas in a governing limbo and U.S. companies wary. Only a stable government can provide sufficient security for the companies to commit to long-term investments.

Over time, the key power brokers in Venezuela may splinter over their new fifty-fifty-style deal with the U.S. “The current arrangement is unlikely to be convenient at the same time for all of them. One of them or some of them will try to change it,” Jana Nelson, a top Pentagon official on Western Hemisphere affairs during the Biden administration, told us.

Even so, many in Venezuela seem guardedly optimistic. Guerra, the former central-bank official, used to be critical of the opposition for courting a U.S. intervention, but he’s now bullish about the economy. He envisions the U.S. government placing conditions on how the regime can spend future oil revenues to make sure the nation’s natural wealth is used to revive Venezuela.

We pointed out that this scenario rests on the assumption that Trump cares about the fate of Venezuela and its people. “Well, we cannot assume anything else,” Guerra told us. The Venezuelan people, he added, are “just onlookers, not actors. We are just looking at what’s happening, hoping for the best. We don’t get to determine anything.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appeared before a bank of television cameras in Washington, D.C., on Saturday night to blame the man who had been shot to death by federal agents in Minneapolis that morning for his own death, claiming without evidence that he had intended “to kill law enforcement” and had been “brandishing” a weapon. Behind her stood the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Rodney Scott, sending a silent message of unity.

But behind the scenes, the senior ranks of the Department of Homeland Security were divided. Until minutes before they walked in front of the cameras, Noem and Scott had not spoken to each other that day, even as Noem took charge of her department’s response to the shooting and coordinated with the White House and other officials in Scott’s agency, two people familiar with their interactions told us.

Donald Trump has said over the years that he welcomes and even encourages rivalries in his administration, and delights in watching aides compete to please him. But for the past year, the president has allowed a rift to widen within the team tasked with delivering on the mass-deportation plan that is his most important domestic-policy initiative. That has led to months of acrimony and left many veteran officials at DHS—including those who support the president’s deportation goals—astonished at the dysfunction.

The president’s crackdown has adopted an improvisational approach, not an institutional one, with blurred leadership roles and no clear chain of command. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has been holding daily conference calls pressuring DHS and other federal agencies to prioritize immigration arrests and deportations above all other objectives. Noem and her de facto chief of staff, Corey Lewandowski, who has been working at DHS as a “special government employee,” have aggressively tried to meet Miller’s demands and use the department’s advertising budgets and social-media accounts to promote anti-immigrant messaging. They have worked around Tom Homan, the White House “border czar,” who has had little role in operations, instead dispatching a second-tier Border Patrol official named Gregory Bovino to sweep through cities led by Democrats. Bovino told his superiors that he reported directly to Noem, not to Scott—who wanted his agents to go back to protecting U.S. borders, and has struggled to maintain control of his own agency.

This story about the infighting around Trump is based on interviews with 12 people familiar with the tensions inside DHS, including senior administration officials, most of whom requested anonymity to speak frankly about internal events. “The President’s entire immigration enforcement team are on the same page,” the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote to us in response.

Scott and Homan declined to comment. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for DHS, told us that Noem’s Saturday comments on the shooting were based on CBP reports “from a very chaotic scene.” McLaughlin added, “We are not going to spend time giving any oxygen to these anonymous accounts.”

When Noem and Scott stepped before the cameras on Saturday, Noem appeared to have the upper hand. But the balance of power has since shifted. Frustrated by the bipartisan backlash to Alex Pretti’s death, Trump announced on Monday that Homan would take over the operation in Minnesota. Bovino has been stripped of his “commander” role and sent back to his old job on the border in El Centro, California. Seemingly well aware of the divides around him, Trump announced that he was removing Noem from the chain of command in Minnesota. “Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,” Trump said.

When Homan spoke to reporters today, with Scott standing behind him, he tried striking a conciliatory tone and that he’d arrived to make changes in federal operations. “I didn’t come to Minnesota for photo ops or headlines,” he said. Homan urged Minnesota leaders to give ICE more access to detainees in local jails, and said he’d withdraw federal forces if cooperation improves.

Homan and Scott arrived in the state Monday with orders to de-escalate tensions in Minneapolis, which Trump has flooded with 3,000 federal agents—the largest Homeland Security deployment in history. That same day, Noem and Lewandowski went to the White House for a two-hour meeting with the president and some of his top aides, but not with Miller. The following day, Trump said that he had come to share the concerns of Scott and Homan, saying that it was normal for him to “shake up teams.”

“You know, Bovino is very good, but he’s a pretty out-there kind of a guy,” Trump told Fox News. “And in some cases that’s good; maybe it wasn’t good here.”

But the battle inside the agency continued. Scott sent an email to senior officials at CBP on Monday reminding them that he was in charge of the agency and that they report to him, according to two people familiar with the document. Yesterday, the DHS general counsel James Percival notified CBP employees to disregard the email because it had not gone through legal review, the people told us.

The split between the two factions is not ideological. Homan and Scott are no less hard-line on border and immigration enforcement than Noem and Lewandowski are. Homan—who was an architect of the family-separation policy during Trump’s first term—wants to ramp up deportations with more ICE officers, detention capacity, and deportation flights, but without the social-media trolling and the show-me-your-papers approach to fishing for deportees in American cities.

Both men worked their way up through the ranks of their agencies. They represent an institutional wing of MAGA that wants to pursue the president’s deportation goals using existing chain-of-command structures and the conventional division of labor, in which the Border Patrol guards the border and ICE handles immigration arrests in U.S. cities, usually aiming to minimize disruption. They also have the backing of many career officials at DHS who told us that they see Noem’s approach as ad hoc, performative, and possibly motivated by her own political ambitions, with Lewandowski pulling the strings. At DHS headquarters in southeast Washington, staffers address Lewandowski as “chief” even though he doesn’t have an actual title there, three current officials told us.

Allies of Noem, meanwhile, have decided that Homan and Scott are bureaucratic dinosaurs who are unable to achieve the president’s objectives. They have tried to satisfy the demands of Miller, who runs immigration policy inside Trump’s orbit and functions as the actual “czar” of the president’s deportation campaign. Miller has set aggressive benchmarks for using the $170 billion in ICE and CBP funding included in Trump’s budget bill last year, telling ICE officials to make 3,000 immigration arrests a day to hit the White House target of 1 million deportations a year. Noem put CBP officials in charge of ICE offices and diverted highly trained investigative agents from trafficking cases and drug cartels to make immigration arrests on city streets.

The killings of Pretti and Renee Good this month have been the two most politically damaging events in a wider, militarized show of force that has turned Trump’s best-polling issue into a political liability. Noem has spent more than $200 million on advertising to promote the deportation campaign, but it has instead been defined largely by images of excess: toddlers being taken into custody, U.S. citizens being yanked from their cars, Bovino’s masked commandos storming a Chicago apartment building after rappelling from a Black Hawk helicopter.

“Memes don’t win the media narrative. Professionalism does,” a veteran official critical of Noem and her team told us. Another former DHS official told us that Trump’s mass-deportation goals have been held back in the process. “Look at the whole thing playing out in Minnesota,” the former official said. “A lot of the controversy and negative optics could have been avoided—and are avoided in other locations—if not for Corey and the secretary.”

Allies of Homan and Scott believe that a reckoning may be coming. “Lewandowski messed up by going to war with Rodney Scott and deploying Bovino to the interior,” one senior DHS official told us. “There is no one at DHS with higher credentials than Scott, and sidelining him for petty reasons distracts from POTUS missions.”

Critics of Scott who spoke with us argue that he lacks the focus and drive to achieve the president’s priorities, spends too much time in meetings that don’t end in decisions, and is failing to do enough to drive the president’s top priority of finishing the border wall. They say that he had little involvement in the CBP deployment to Minnesota and other cities, and did not visit the state to meet with commanders on the ground until this week. “He is not a team player,” one Homeland Security official told us of Scott. “I really think Rodney is kind of on an island.”

During the meeting with Trump on Monday, Noem spoke at length about her concerns with the slow pace of border-wall construction, according to a person briefed on the conversation. Since the start of Trump’s second term, only about 24 miles of wall have been built, including replacement sections, the person said. Noem has made clear that she holds Scott responsible.

“The president was very focused on the status of the wall,” the official said. “The president is pissed.”

The breakdown that led to this week’s shift inside DHS dates back months. Noem lacks the ability to fire Scott, who was confirmed by the Senate, so she has had to get creative. Late last year, her deputies forced Scott to fire several of his senior staff, moves that were recently reported by the Washington Examiner. Scott’s chief of staff was then promoted, and Noem’s office selected a replacement. After Joseph N. Mazzara, an attorney working in Noem’s office, was installed as CBP deputy commissioner, Scott attempted to reclaim control of his agency.

In a memo sent on January 6, described to us by four people familiar with its contents, Scott asked senior leadership at CBP to report to his office any contact they had with “special government employees”—a request that many interpreted as an effort to curtail the influence of Lewandowski. Within hours, the DHS general counsel James Percival had objected to the memo, as had the White House counsel’s office. A White House official told us that the involvement of the White House counsel followed a normal practice of engaging with general counsels at government departments on “issues of common concern.”

Despite the pushback, Scott’s office issued a second memo later that day to senior CBP officials: They should log any communications with officials outside the agency, including senior DHS and White House officials. Both memos were ultimately rescinded after legal pushback from DHS and the White House counsel, these people told us. Scott’s fumbled attempts to curtail outside influence on his agency raised further concerns at DHS headquarters about his leadership. “You don’t get to this level where you jump on your horse and play cowboy like that,” one person familiar with the events told us.

Days later, Scott found his credibility publicly under attack. Politico reported that top brass in Noem’s office had objected to plans for a $2.1 million office refurbishment at CBP headquarters in Washington. (Renovation questions are known to get the president’s attention. Just days earlier, the Justice Department had launched an investigation into the chairman of the Federal Reserve and a $2.5 billion renovation he was overseeing.) The Office of Management and Budget, in a move that has not been previously reported, began asking CBP about the plans, exploring whether they violated the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits spending that contradicts congressional appropriations, according to three people familiar with the outreach.

On the same day that the Politico article was published, Miller gathered agency leaders at the White House to discuss the administration’s success in spending funds appropriated with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Scott told those gathered that starting on February 1, wall construction would speed up dramatically. Others in the department doubt he will be able to achieve his new goals.

A veteran official involved with the border-wall project told us that contracting rules imposed by Lewandowski last summer—which require Noem’s signature on any contract or modification exceeding $100,000—have slowed the pace of construction. The funding bill provides nearly $50 billion for the border wall (10 times the amount that triggered a congressional shutdown in late 2018), and the official estimated that more than two-thirds of the contracts are worth $100,000 or more.

Noem’s team says that this is false, contending that she quickly approves contracts and that CBP has not yet awarded all of the prime contracts for construction. “None of this is on Noem,” the DHS official told us.

In recent weeks, DHS officials have discussed hiring a management contractor to oversee the planning and construction of the border wall, replacing senior officials at CBP. The idea has faced some resistance because it would echo an effort undertaken by former President George W. Bush in 2006, when his administration hired Boeing, a defense contractor and commercial-airplane manufacturer, to oversee $2.5 billion in spending on border security. By 2010, CBP’s inspector general was reporting that the agency had failed to properly manage the contract, which was dogged by missed deadlines and cost overruns.

“Adults have arrived.” That’s how one DHS official deployed in Minneapolis described the appearance of Homan and Scott.

Homan began by meeting with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. “While we don’t agree on everything, these meetings were a productive starting point and I look forward to more conversations with key stakeholders in the days ahead,” Homan announced on social media afterward. Trump officials have been targeting the two men and other Democratic leaders in the state with a criminal investigation and possible obstruction charges. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, accused them of “terrorism” just two weeks ago.

Administration officials insist that the Minneapolis crackdown will continue, but they have started pulling Border Patrol agents out of the city. Homan is trying to compel Democratic leaders to ease local “sanctuary policies” and give ICE more access to local jails and immigrants with criminal records. Walz and other Minnesota leaders want the government to allow the state to conduct an investigation into Pretti’s killing.

Bovino’s return to his old job on the border leaves the administration without a field commander for the rolling conquest of blue cities that has defined its strategy since May. The White House has not clarified whether that approach will continue or whether Homan will now be in charge of the president’s wider removal campaign. But McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, announced that Noem is “very happy” to have Homan take over in Minnesota. “Her portfolio is really huge,” McLaughlin said.

When the 2018 family-separation policy became a political debacle, Trump officials scrambled to distance themselves. The same impulse is again on display. After previously championing Bovino’s efforts in Minnesota, Noem’s team has this week privately pointed to the arrest quotas pushed by Miller at the White House as a cause of the problems. Miller called Pretti an “assassin” within hours of the shooting. But on Tuesday, he suggested that the failure of the CBP team in Minneapolis to follow White House guidance may have played a role in Pretti’s death.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> The Department of Justice and the FBI have launched investigations into the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by Customs and Border Protection officers in Minnesota. Amidst massive anti-ICE protests and legal battles over federal immigration enforcement, the FBI has taken the lead on the probe originally handled by the Department of Homeland Security.

        The Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting of Alex Pretti in Minnesota, US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Friday.

“All that that means is that (the Department of Homeland Security), as they’ve, as the Secretary has said, is conducting an investigation, as they should,” Blanche said. “And as they do every time there’s a tragic event like this, and the FBI, in their role which is a separate role from DHS, is also take looking into it and conducting investigation.”

CNN previously reported that the FBI is taking the lead on the investigation into Pretti, which was initially handled by DHS’s investigative agency.

The announcement means that the Justice Department is looking into whether the DHS officers who shot Pretti violated the law, and marks an expansion of the federal government’s investigation into the matter.

“The family’s focus is on a fair and impartial investigation that examines the facts around his murder,” an attorney for Pretti’s family, Steve Schleicher, said in a statement to CNN on Friday.

Customs and Border Protection are also conducting an internal probe on the officers who shot and killed Pretti.

Later on during Friday’s press conference, Blanche appeared to backtrack from his initial confirmation.

“I don’t want to overstate what’s happening,” Blanche said. “I don’t want the takeaway to be that there’s some massive civil rights investigation that’s happening.”

Blanche added that it was “a standard investigation by the FBI” and said that “when there’s circumstances like what we saw last Saturday, and that investigation, to the extent it needs to involve lawyers at the Civil Rights Division, it will involve those.”

The FBI is now leading the investigation into the shooting of Alex Pretti by Customs and Border Protection officers in Minnesota, taking over the investigation from the Department of Homeland Security’s investigative agency, HSI, a senior DHS official confirmed to CNN.

In the wake of the shooting, HSI took the lead on the investigation, with FBI providing support, including by initially processing Pretti’s firearm at a local laboratory. FBI Director Kash Patel has previously referred questions about the investigation to DHS.

On Fox News Thursday night, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem also said the FBI was leading the investigation.

This comes after White House aide Stephen Miller’s acknowledgement that “may not have been following” proper protocol before the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti.

It’s unclear what, exactly, the change means for the investigation and the FBI has, in the past, been the agency tasked with investigating such shootings along with local investigators.

“We will continue to follow the investigation that the FBI is leading,” Noem said Thursday, “and giving them all the information they need to bring that to conclusion – and make sure that the American people know the truth of that situation.”

As President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has whisked through major US cities, trial-level judges attempting to restrain the frenzied actions of federal agents have been repeatedly slapped down by higher courts – often with the help of judges the president put on the bench in his first term.

A series of rulings from the Supreme Court and federal appeals courts dominated by Trump nominees have overturned early victories secured by opponents of the immigration blitzes in California, Chicago and Minnesota.

The administration’s latest win came Monday, when a three-judge federal appeals court panel indefinitely paused a Minneapolis judge’s decision to put tight guardrails on how agents can respond to individuals peacefully protesting Operation Metro Surge, which has sparked intense opposition in the Twin Cities and led to the fatal shooting of two US citizens by federal officers.

Trump and his allies have long complained that lower court judges have acted out of bounds in cases challenging his agenda, particularly in the immigration context, over which they argue he has broad, unreviewable authority.

President Donald Trump said Thursday evening that there were no plans to pull immigration enforcement agents out of Minneapolis, after border czar Tom Homan announced earlier in the day he had ordered federal immigration authorities to work on a drawdown plan.

Asked if he’d be pulling back immigration agents, Trump said, “We’ll do whatever we can to keep our country safe.” Pressed again if he was not pulling back, Trump said, “No, no not at all.”

Trump’s comments — made at the premiere of first lady Melania Trump’s documentary at the Kennedy Center — followed Homan’s remarks that morning that he was working on a “draw down plan” to begin reducing the number of immigration agents in the state and insisted that upholding “public safety should be paramount.”

Speaking on the red carpet Thursday evening, Trump heaped praise on Homan, calling the border czar “terrific.”

“I think he’s terrific but we have to get rid of the criminals,” Trump said. “We have to take criminals out of our country so from that standpoint, nothing’s going to change.”

Press freedom groups are condemning the arrests of journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort in connection with their coverage of an anti-ICE protest inside a Minnesota church on January 18.

“These arrests under bogus legal theories for obviously constitutionally protected reporting are clear warning shots aimed at other journalists,” said Seth Stern, the chief of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation. “The unmistakable message is that journalists must tread cautiously because the government is looking for any way to target them.”

Stern told CNN: “The answer to this outrageous attack is not fear or self-censorship. It’s an even stronger commitment to journalism, the truth, and the First Amendment. If the Trump administration thinks it can bully journalists into submission, it is wrong.”

Katherine Jacobsen, the US, Canada and Caribbean program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, said Lemon’s arrest “should alarm all Americans.”

“As an international organization, we know that the treatment of journalists is an indicator of the condition of a country’s democracy. The United States is doing poorly,” Jacobsen said.

Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the nonprofit advocacy group Public Citizen, called the action against Lemon an “authoritarian breach” and an “egregious violation of the First Amendment.”

“Reporters in America are free to view, document, and share information with the public,” Gilbert said. “This arrest is a constitutional violation, an outrage, an authoritarian breach, and utterly appalling.”

Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated the date of the church protest.

Independent journalist Georgia Fort was taken into custody by federal agents Friday morning, an official who was briefed on the arrest told CNN’s Sara Sidner Friday morning.

Fort’s arrest comes the morning after former CNN anchor and independent journalist Don Lemon was taken into custody.

Both Fort and Lemon filmed dozens of anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protesters as they rushed into church in St. Paul, Minnesota, earlier this month, interrupting a service, leading to tense confrontations.

US Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed in a post this morning on X that Lemon and Fort, as well as two others, were arrested in connection with the church protest. Federal agents arrested the four at Bondi’s direction, the post reads.

Independent journalist who covered Minneapolis church protest says agents were at her door

“This is all stemming from the fact that I filmed a protest as a member of the media,” Fort said during a Facebook Live this morning before she surrendered to agents.

Details on what charges Fort and Lemon face weren’t immediately available.

“It’s hard to understand how we have a constitution, constitutional rights, when you can just be arrested for being a member of the press,” Fort said before ending this morning’s live video.

Journalist Don Lemon was taken into custody on Thursday night in connection to a protest at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, according to his attorney.

Lemon, a former CNN anchor, was with dozens of anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protesters as they rushed into Cities Church in St. Paul earlier this month, interrupting a church service and leading to tense confrontations.

Court records related to his arrest were not immediately available. Lemon is expected to appear in federal court in Los Angeles on Friday. Lemon was in Los Angeles to cover the Grammy Awards and was arrested after 11 p.m. local time in a hotel lobby in Beverley Hills as he was leaving for an event.

CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice for for information.

“Don Lemon was taken into custody by federal agents last night in Los Angeles, where he was covering the Grammy awards,” his attorney Abbe Lowell said in a statement early Friday. “Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done. The First Amendment exists to protect journalists whose role it is to shine light on the truth and hold those in power accountable.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last night that she was using “the best information we had at the time” when she made her initial statements about the killing of Alex Pretti, the second person killed by federal agents in Minneapolis this month.

Noem, who was among the top officials claiming in the immediate aftermath of the shooting that ICU nurse Alex Pretti was a “domestic terrorist” who posed a threat to law enforcement, on Thursday described the situation as “chaotic” and noted she was “being relayed information from on the ground from (Customs and Border Protection) agents and officers that were there.”

Noem’s comments come as she faces increased scrutiny of her job performance and her initial statements on the circumstances around Pretti’s killing.

CNN reported earlier Thursday that President Donald Trump and his top officials have publicly and privately maintained that the president still has full confidence in Noem, even as he has moved to sideline one of his top officials on the ground, Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino, putting border czar Tom Homan in charge of immigration operations in Minneapolis.

Senate leaders have a bipartisan funding deal in hand, but it remains to be seen whether they will avert a costly government shutdown as the clock ticks down toward Friday’s midnight deadline.

While negotiations appeared to stall late Thursday evening, the pace at which they had moved in recent days underscored the White House’s desire to avoid another prolonged federal funding fight. It also stood as a tacit acknowledgement of the political risks of ignoring the public outcry over ICE’s harsh tactics.

Lawmakers left Capitol Hill late Thursday after all rank-and-file senators could not come to agreement to swiftly move the spending package — the contours of which negotiators from both parties and the White House struck earlier in the day.Senators are set to return today with an eye toward sending the bills back to the House for final approval, but negotiations can change rapidly.

The deal, announced by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer hours before, includes a two-week stopgap funding extension for the Department of Homeland Security that Democrats had requested.

It also separates the DHS bill from a package of bipartisan spending bills to fund critical agencies through September, including the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor, Education, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development.

Even if the Senate is successful Friday, final passage could still be delayed until Monday — past the official shutdown deadline — as the House would have to return to Washington from its week-long recess. Speaker Mike Johnson, so far, has been non-committal on when exactly that might be, but swift approval by his chamber could blunt impacts of any lapse in funding to the federal workforce.

President Donald Trump said Alex Pretti, the man fatally shot by Customs and Border protection agents in Minneapolis Saturday, appeared “crazed and out of control” in video of a separate confrontation with federal agents 11 days before his death.

In the video that surfaced this week, Pretti is seen shouting at federal agents and kicking their vehicle’s taillight as the agents are driving away. The agents stop, exit their vehicle and tackle Pretti to the ground. The interaction in Minneapolis lasts a few seconds before Pretti gets up and the agents walk away. It is unclear what took place immediately before or after the footage.

Pretti suffered a broken rib during the encounter, sources told CNN.

Video of agents shooting Pretti and the Trump administration’s efforts to paint him as an “assassin” or “domestic terrorist” drew quick condemnation, including from some Republicans.

“A week before Alex was gunned down in the street – despite posing no threat to anyone – he was violently assaulted by a group of ICE agents,” Steve Schleicher, attorney for the Pretti family, told CNN when the video was released.

Dozens of asylum seekers and refugees who passed a rigorous, years-long vetting process before being admitted to the United States, have been arrested in Minnesota in recent weeks, immigration lawyers and advocates say.

The immigrants are shackled and placed on flights to detention facilities in Texas, where they are forced to recount painful asylum claims with limited or no contact with family members or attorneys, lawyers and advocates say.

Some, after days of interviews with officers, have been released in Texas without money, identification or phones. Others remain detained without information about why they’re being held.

Late Wednesday, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from arresting or detaining resettled refugees in Minnesota while a class-action lawsuit challenging the practice plays out. The judge also ordered the immediate release of all detained refugees in Minnesota, as well as the release of those taken out of the state within five days and gave the government 48 hours to provide a list of detained refugees.

CNN reached out to US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for comment.

Nationwide protests against President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown are expected today – with organizers calling for a boycott of school, work and shopping in areas across the country.

The demonstrations follow an “economic blackout” in Minneapolis last week, where hundreds of businesses were urged to shut for the day and thousands, gathering in stadiums or taking to the streets in sub-zero temperatures, called for ICE to get out of the city.

“The people of the Twin Cities have shown the way for the whole country – to stop ICE’s reign of terror, we need to SHUT IT DOWN,” organizers of today’s protests, endorsed by hundreds of organizations across the country, wrote on the shutdown’s website.

Elsewhere around the country, dozens of demonstrations and marches have been organized.

Protesters are expected to gather outside Minneapolis’ Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building starting at 8 a.m. local time, and a “national shutdown” march beginning at the city’s Government Plaza will begin at 2 p.m. Friday, according to organizers.

In New York City, protesters are expected to gather at 11 a.m. ET for an “ICE Out” demonstration at Foley Square, while in Atlanta, a “national shutdown” rally will take place at 5 p.m. ET on Buford Highway, a thoroughfare known for its vibrant mix of international cuisine and culture in the city.

Kathleen Walters was only 23 days away from qualifying for early retirement at the IRS when she decided to quit, rather than acquiesce to a Trump-administration request that she break the law and compromise millions of people’s privacy. She’s one of hundreds of thousands of civil servants who have left or been fired from their federal-government jobs in the past year. In this episode, host Anne Applebaum speaks with Don Moynihan, an expert in the history of public policy from the University of Michigan. He explains how the destruction of America’s civil service is part of the administration’s greater effort to create a government that derives its power through unprecedented means and fundamentally disrupts democracy as we know it.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

[Music]

Anne Applebaum: From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I’m Anne Applebaum. In this new season, I’m asking how the Trump White House is rewriting the rules of U.S. politics, and talking to Americans whose lives have been changed as a result. Today’s episode examines the destruction of the civil service: the removal of professionals, and their replacement with loyalists. I’ve seen this kind of transformation before, in other failing democracies. Everyone suffers from the degradation of public services. Government institutions run by lackeys are also more easily manipulated by autocratic leaders, and no longer serve the public interest. Kathleen Walters found herself in the center of this story in 2025.

[Music]

Don Moynihan: I don’t think this is an anomaly, and I think what it tells us is about the way in which Trump is managing the civil service in his second term in a fashion that’s quite different from how he did in the first term.

Applebaum: Professor Don Moynihan is an expert in the history of public policy, and teaches at the University of Michigan.

Moynihan: And a lot of these disagreements really boil down to whether the president can order people to break the law. It’s a red flag when you see so many people saying, My god. This is so illegal that we cannot, in good conscience, stick around any longer.

Applebaum: Don, there are now many, many civil servants who have left or been fired, so tell us more about how this term may be different from President Trump’s first term.

Moynihan: I spent a few years at the end of Trump’s first term trying to think about how bad could it get in his second term. I did not anticipate just how bad it would become, partly because I didn’t anticipate that so many laws, civil-service laws and other laws, would be broken with seeming impunity. One of his big lessons from his first term was that there are a lot of lawyers in government who are telling me, No, I can’t do things. I need lawyers who will tell me, Yes you can. And so he’s systematically pushing the envelope on policy and, in many cases, breaking the law. And then also replacing those lawyers with more amenable actors. And so we see again and again, principled public officials saying, We think this crosses the boundaries, effectively being put on administrative leave, being told to resign, or, in some cases, being fired.

Applebaum: I want to ask you about the implications of all that, but first I think it would be helpful to give a little background here, because the United States hasn’t always had a professional, nonpartisan civil service. Until the Pendleton Act of the 1880s, we had something called the “spoils system,” which meant that only loyal party members could get jobs in government. And that system created corruption. It encouraged bribery. It was inefficient. How did that change?

Moynihan: The first major civil-service reform bill is introduced during the Civil War by Charles Sumner. And it’s a response to the perception that a lot of money is being wasted, the war effort is less efficient than it should be, partly because of the corruption that’s embedded in the use of public funds. We see stories of, basically, large contracts going to people aligned with the party. And so it became clearer to the public that you couldn’t really trust that the politicians were acting in the public interest when there was so much money sloshing around the public sector.

Applebaum: And so instead of that, we created a system that requires people to be hired and fired based on merit. And the Civil Service Reform Act, which comes later in the 20th century, also says you can’t hire or fire people because of their political affiliations. Correct?

Moynihan: That’s exactly right. The Civil Service Reform Act is the first act to actually write down what those merit principles are, and it specifies, very clearly, that employees cannot be treated differently because of their political affiliations.

Applebaum: And is the current administration adhering to this act?

Moynihan: Neither in spirit or in the letter of the law is the current administration adhering to this act, in my view. I think we’re at the most dramatic attack on the civil-service system since its creation in the 1880s. It feels that there is an element of the spoils system that is returning, but also, there is this much more direct attack on democracy that is part of the mechanization and the weaponization of the civil-service system right now.

Applebaum: And is this an effective strategy for improving government efficiency?

Moynihan: We know that research tells us that more politicization leads to generally worse outcomes. And this is for a variety of reasons. One is that you get less competent people who work for government under more politicized regimes. The more talented people tend to leave. You also have officials who don’t want to share bad news with their political principals. And so the presidents or the agency leaders are simply making worse decisions because they don’t have good access to information.

I’ll give you two examples of pieces of research here. One is that after the Pendleton Act, and the post office was no longer driven by patronage, you saw the accuracy and speed of mail delivery improve. So in a very specific way, you could see how performance got better. Another example is: The Bush administration used to rate agency programs on a one-to-five scale from “not performing” to “excellent.” And one analysis found that programs that were run by career civil servants tended to perform better than programs that were run by political appointees, all else being equal. Once you add politicization, things tend to get worse; once you give autonomy to capable professionals, things tend to get better when it comes to performance.

Applebaum: I mean, is there a precedent of other countries that had meritocratic civil service sliding backwards? The only example that comes into my head, since my background is in writing Soviet history, is the Bolsheviks, in the Soviet Union. The Soviet state created a civil service in which you could only advance if you were a party member, and not only that, you had to publicly state your allegiance to the party and its constantly changing principles, whenever you were asked to do it. Is there another country, another example, that you think of?

Moynihan: In Hungary, they put party cronies in charge of major parts of the system through a privatization scheme. In Turkey, we saw mass purges of people who were perceived as not being aligned with the administration. And so there is a common pattern there that I think serves as a warning sign.

Applebaum: And where do you see those warning signs now, in America?

Moynihan: So I think we’re seeing a multipronged attack on civil-service capabilities. Partly it’s through hiring. They want to put more loyalists into civil-servant positions. Partly it’s through firing. People who won’t go along with breaking the law are being shown the door. And partly it’s also through just instilling a culture of fear within our government.

Applebaum: Let’s break those down. What is unprecedented about the way the Trump administration is hiring civil servants?

Moynihan: The Trump administration announced a new hiring process, which it claimed would bring in better candidates for public-sector jobs. There were a couple of really unusual aspects to that. One is that people would submit essays where they would be asked to name their favorite Trump executive order and how they would help serve President Trump. And so that is new—the idea that job candidates will be asked, How are you gonna serve this particular president? Even though the job is, you’re supposed to serve every president, not just this individual president. The second part of the hiring process that’s changing now is that political appointees are directly involved in choosing these civil servants, and so it eliminates any barrier between the political appointees—those who are directly loyal to the president—and the people who are hired, which makes it much more likely that the people who are hired are also going to share those same political loyalties to President Trump.

Applebaum: Of course, political appointees have always had some involvement with the civil service, but there still seems to be something different now. There’s a culture of fear around these appointments that didn’t exist before, and we know that that culture of fear is being created deliberately. And we know that because the architect of a lot of these changes, Russell Vought, at the Office of Management and Budget, has said, “We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. We want to put them in trauma.” How are we seeing that play out?

Moynihan: I certainly think that was his goal. He has been upfront about viewing the government as an enemy, wanting a much smaller bureaucracy. And I think he has succeeded. One thing that’s important to understand is that this culture of fear that we’re seeing is not just driven by Trump officials. It’s also driven by Trump-aligned actors in broader society. And so, for example, Elon Musk might tweet about an individual government employee. They then get doxxed; they have to leave their home. You see private actors who are sort of conservative commentators identify individual civil servants. These could be FBI agents. And you read the next week: Those people have been fired.

And you also see a very organized effort, and some funded by organizations like the Heritage Foundation, to FOIA individual civil servants, to basically go through their emails, see if they can find any damaging language that would allow them to be fired, and to create, effectively, enemies lists, where individual civil servants are put on a website somewhere. There are lists of alleged crimes, which are often things like, Served on a DEI panel once, are listed. And then, again, you predictably see sometimes formal retaliation for that—a person might be put on leave or fired—but also informal attacks, where people get nasty phone calls, emails; sometimes people will turn up at their home and threaten them. And so the fear is not irrational. It is not just in the workplace; it’s in the broader society that these civil servants are now working in.

Applebaum: The third warning sign you listed is the mass firings. Since the Trump administration has taken office, hundreds of thousands of civil servants have been fired or have quit. Are these mass firings legal? I had always assumed, prior to this administration, that it wasn’t that easy to fire civil servants. In fact, this was one of the complaints that was sometimes made about them, is that they can’t be fired. How is it possible that this administration can just tell thousands of people to leave their jobs?

Moynihan: There are so many things I thought were illegal that now appear to be legal. It’s hard to keep a full list. If you asked me a year ago, Can the president eliminate an agency? or Can the president impound funds? I would’ve said, No, those are illegal things because that takes up congressional prerogatives too great an extent. They’re clearly unconstitutional. And now we have seen the president do both of those things. When it comes to firing individual employees, it is onerous to fire an individual employee. You can fire them for calls. That is to say: If they’re poor performers, you can fire them. They can appeal that decision. It can take a while to do that, but if you document the basis for the firing, it is possible to get rid of them. Ironically, it’s somewhat easier to fire lots of employees, because there is a legal “reduction in force” process—RIFs—where agencies can say: Because we need to save money, or because of some reorganization, we are going to eliminate a lot of positions.

Whether the Trump administration is using those reduction-in-force authorities legally, I think, is a very open question. RIFs are very technical documents and there’s a lot of procedures. It looks to me that the Trump administration has not followed in implementing those RIFs. Also, a huge number of people left through the deferred-resignation program, the so-called “fork in the road” voluntary-resignation program that Elon Musk introduced. It feels fairly clear to me that that was not following statutes, but a lot of people simply did leave, and it doesn’t seem like the Supreme Court is gonna do anything about it. The ways in which there was mass firings of probationary employees—a judge has ruled those to be illegal, but he’s also said: Well, it’s too late to fix it now. And so there is this sort of disturbing trend where things that really do appear to be illegal in terms of how federal employees are treated are allowed to move forward. And then maybe, down the line, the court will say, Well, that wasn’t right. But at that point, the remedy has pretty much walked out the door. Too much time has passed. So, for example, USAID doesn’t exist as an agency anymore. And so even if the courts were to say, That was illegal, there’s no workable solution for the employees who were laid off or for the programs that they were trying to implement.

Applebaum: Coming up after the break: The attack on the civil service may be part of a bigger project: Trump’s entourage wants to change our system so that they can stay in power.

[Break]

Applebaum: Don, talk about the practical impact of these firings. Of course they are felt by the people themselves, who’ve lost their jobs, but how will this affect the public at large?

Moynihan: I think there are two ways to answer that question. And so the first way is to think about the federal workforce as a group of employees who work for you. Do you want a group of employees that are knowledgeable, committed to their job, really dedicated to the goals that they’re trying to implement? And I think, historically, in America, we’ve mostly said yes. We get to hire some very smart people in government, partly because they care a lot about the mission, partly because they like the stability of government work. And so we probably get people who are coming not just for the paycheck—because they could earn more in the private sector—but because they’re really committed to the statutory goals of protecting the environment or emergency management. If you think of yourself as a mini-CEO overseeing this workforce, what we’re seeing is a bunch of structural changes that is gonna make it less easy for you to attract and retain good employees. They don’t appreciate the lack of stability. They don’t appreciate the toxic work environment, or being demonized. And so a lot of those people will exit, or they will never join the public sector in the first place. The stock of human capital in the workforce just gets worse.

Then we get to specific public services. And here, it’s harder to say, Planes are going to drop out of the sky tomorrow because there’s a 5 percent cut of FAA employees. And this is something about public services that is sometimes maybe a little different from private services, which is that the erosion of quality can be slower and harder to observe. I do think there are places we are starting to see this. Social Security has been struggling to serve its customers. I think the IRS—the fact that they’re hiring back people now is an admission that they simply don’t have enough people to manage the inflow of tax forms that will come at tax season. I think emergency management, to me, is a huge red flag, where FEMA did not have an especially bad summer in terms of natural disasters, but with flooding in Texas, it clearly was not as able to respond, partly because of the cuts and services, partly because of the extra layers of red tape that the DHS leadership imposed upon it. And so I think there will be more stories like that, where failures occur in a visible way. And then if you look at those failures honestly, you can say, Well, partly, this is because the Trump administration chose to reduce the capacity of these agencies.

Applebaum: So if things do begin to erode and government services begin to decline and more accidents happen with pollution or food safety, do you think people will make the connection between those accidents, and that erosion, and the attacks on the civil service?

Moynihan: What I do think is true is that there is a moment here of opportunity for civic education between the citizens of America and the government that serves them, where we can explain to them: Here it is; here’s what your government does. Here’s how your taxpayer dollars are spent. And when you sort of pull out these capacities, here’s how things start to collapse. We mostly don’t have those moments of opportunities, because they’re mostly moments of really bad outcomes. I think about Hurricane Katrina. That was an opportunity where we understood that putting unqualified people in charge of FEMA contributed to some very bad outcomes for the residents of New Orleans. So I think the work to be done there is to connect these failures that we see with choices made by the administration to undermine state capacity.

Applebaum: Earlier, you directly linked the civil-service firings with a decline in democracy, and you’ve also written elsewhere that President Trump is trying to build a more authoritarian political system. Let’s talk more specifically about what that means. For example, direct control of some state institutions could give a ruling party or leader advantages. So if the president can use the IRS to steal data or information, and use it in campaigns, or to initiate investigations against his enemies for political reasons, then the next time we go to vote, the playing field isn’t level. And that’s why neutral institutions that are meant to serve all of us shouldn’t be politicized.

Moynihan: Yeah. You need nonpartisan institutions to, I think, also create trust in government. And if we look at independent agencies, or, let’s say, take the Merit Systems Protection Board. This was created with the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act. These were the actors put in place, where if some employee is saying, I’ve been fired because of my political affiliation, or I’ve been fired because I wouldn’t do something illegal, they have the final sort of judgment on whether discrimination on political basis took place. But President Trump has basically taken control of that entity, removed any Democrats and put only Republicans on it. And so it’s no longer a credible check on government abuses at this point.

Applebaum: All of us have begun to focus on the midterms, and, clearly, the administration is nervous about them. How does the absence of thousands of federal civil servants, or the politicization of the civil service—how could it affect the elections? Do mass firings create an atmosphere of fear that impacts voting? What’s the connection between these two things?

Moynihan: One part of the authoritarian checklist that Trump has struggled most with is elections, and that’s partly because the constitutional system delegates the actual running of elections to state governments. And historically, the federal government has had minimal involvement over these processes. And, you know, right now that seems like a very good thing. But that doesn’t mean that a weaponized Department of Justice couldn’t sue or investigate or harass states or individual election officials for what they regard as improper behavior, which could be behavior that’s actually trying to maintain a free and fair election. It doesn’t mean that the president might not deploy the National Guard to election sites, or put ICE around election sites, on the claim that mass fraud is taking place. It is, I think, the area where Trump has made the least progress. But he’s clearly interested in this as a topic, and he’s issued executive orders claiming authority over elections that, constitutionally, he doesn’t seem to have—as he has done in other areas.

Applebaum: This seems, to me, to be the central point: the possibility of elections being shaped or manipulated by the executive. It’s not necessarily going to happen, but it’s also important that we take the possibility seriously. How do you think we should be thinking this? Should we be behaving differently; should we be acting differently?

Moynihan: We’re currently operating under an administration where you probably can’t retain a significant job if you don’t go along with the idea that somehow the 2020 elections were crooked. It does mean that the leadership of these agencies, like the Department of Justice, are going to be very much driven by people with this conspiratorial worldview, who are perhaps less dedicated to constitutional principles.

So I think in the blue states, you will have attorney generals who will be anticipating these efforts and will be, in some cases, responding to Department of Justice investigations. In red states, you’re gonna have this partisan alignment between the president and the actors in charge of individual states. And so I think, in both cases, public support for elections, public support for maintaining the integrity of elections, will become very important. Visible demonstrations by members of the public, if they can start to realize that there are real threats here, will become, I think, useful in reminding society as a whole that these elections do not run themselves.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> The article critiques conservative podcaster Katie Miller for labeling references to the U.S. Constitution and 'classical liberal democracy' as 'woke' leftist ideology. It explores whether her comments stem from a misunderstanding of Enlightenment philosophy or a deliberate rejection of liberal norms in favor of post-liberal national conservatism.

        Katie Miller, the conservative podcaster, former DOGE aide, and wife to Stephen Miller, thinks the Constitution and the philosophical tradition upon which it is based are “woke” nonsense. Or possibly she doesn’t understand what they are. It’s hard to say which explanation is worse.

For several days, analysts have debated which of these discouraging explanations pertains. The relevant text is a pair of angry posts on X (most of her posts are angry) this week. The first came at 8:20 Monday morning. She highlighted, with evident alarm, a post from the day before by Caitlin Kalinowski, a hardware engineer best known for her work on virtual reality. Miller’s alarmed message read, “OPEN AI EXEC,” followed by three down arrows, a social-media way of saying, Look at the crazy thing this person just wrote!

Kalinowski’s nutty message consisted, in its entirety, of the following:

Quoting directly from the Constitution sans commentary used to be considered a rather cold take. Miller, however, treated it as an act of subversive radicalism.

Sixteen minutes later, Miller’s alarm seemed to have increased. She followed up the previous post by citing an even more offensive social-media message, from Chris Olah, another Silicon Valley executive. Olah set off Miller by including the following line, which she quoted incredulously: “My deep loyalty is to the principles of classical liberal democracy.” Miller commented, “If this is what they say publicly, this is how their AI model is programmed. Woke and deeply leftist ideology is what they want you to rely upon.”

Classical liberalism is not the same thing as woke, leftist ideology—it is essentially the antithesis. Liberalism, in the modern American context, refers to one strand of classical liberalism that favors activist government and social equality (the governing theory of the Democratic Party from the New Deal era onward). Classical liberalism is an Enlightenment philosophy, developed by thinkers such as John Locke and John Stuart Mill, built upon individual rights and limited government.

Classical liberalism is the philosophical inspiration for the American Revolution, the Constitution, and the broad civic norms that have shaped American life since the founding. Figures as diverse as Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan all saw themselves as heirs to classical liberalism.

Woke leftism is a pejorative description for a vein of radical skepticism of classical liberalism. These leftists accuse America’s system of government of being designed to preserve unequal power structures under the guise of philosophical neutrality.

There is also a rising strain of illiberalism on the right, sometimes called post-liberalism. The post-liberal right believes that the far left has captured American institutions, posing a mortal threat to the republic, which has forced the right to employ harsh exercises of state power to save the country from imminent ruin.

Stephen Miller is absolutely an adherent of the post-liberal right. The question is whether his wife was intending to endorse post-liberalism, or whether she mistook “classical liberal” to mean “liberals, but old”—like Walter Mondale or something.

Her posts offer support for both interpretations. The she-made-a-mistake hypothesis emphasizes her amateurish conflation. If Katie Miller wanted to accuse Olah of belonging to the woke left, she’d have claimed he was hiding behind classical liberalism, rather than citing his identification with the Enlightenment as a confession of left-wing radicalism. This reading would suggest Miller lacks any grasp of the theory that her husband, as a devoted national conservative, is dedicated to tearing down. Say what you want about the tenets of national conservatism, dude, at least it’s an ethos.

The intentionality hypothesis assumes she is consciously endorsing the theory embraced by her husband. “Yes, we’re very aware that you and your husband hate America’s system of liberal democracy that’s built on free elections, the rule of law, equal rights, and the freedom of speech, assembly, press, and religion,” Jon Favreau, of Pod Save America,replied to her post. Miller’s outraged posts about the Constitution support this interpretation. Since Miller has obviously heard of the Constitution, when she expresses alarm at amendments guaranteeing free speech, equal protection, and the like, she is knowingly taking direct aim at the pillars of liberal democracy.

There’s a third possibility, blending the first two. Miller grasps that social-media messages affirming the value of classical liberalism, and the value of the Constitution it inspired, are a rebuke of Trump.

Many Trumpists, including Trump himself, have a gut-level attachment to post-liberalism without any grounding in its doctrines. The philosophy isn’t terribly sophisticated anyway, and mostly amounts to the syllogism that the left is evil and powerful, so it must be defeated by any means necessary.

Miller demands fealty, or at least silence, as federal law-enforcement officers kill Americans who pose no apparent threat to them. Whether or not she understands post-liberalism at a theoretical level, by browbeating powerful business leaders who have a stake in government policy with the implicit threat of government retribution, she grasps how it works in practice.

        Updated at 4:55 p.m. ET on January 30, 2026

Some of the country’s most powerful men are panicking about testosterone levels. Tucker Carlson’s 2022 documentary The End of Men blamed declining testosterone for the supposedly rampant emasculation of American men. Influencers issue warnings that “low T is ruining young men.” Recently, the Department of Health and Human Services has gone all in on the hormone, publishing new dietary guidelines meant to help men maintain healthy testosterone levels and considering widening access to testosterone-replacement therapy. Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, told me in an email that “a generational decline in testosterone levels among American men is one of many examples of America’s worsening health.”

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has gone further, calling low T counts in teens an “existential issue.” The secretary, who at 72 has the physique of a Marvel character, has touted testosterone as part of his personal anti-aging protocol. He also recently proclaimed that President Trump has the “constitution of a deity” and raging levels of T.

American men are responding by attempting to increase their testosterone levels—whether they need to or not. Low-testosterone clinics, many of them based online, have proliferated, promising men a way to “get your spark back” or “reclaim your life.” So have supplements and accessories designed to support testosterone health—you can buy an ice pack designed specifically to keep testicles cool in a sauna. Recently, a friend who questioned his dedication to testicular health after seeing ads for testosterone boosters asked me if he should buy nontoxic briefs from a company called (yes, seriously) Nads.

Research has shown that average testosterone levels are indeed declining in American men. The primary study on the slump, published in 2007, followed Boston-based men over two decades and found that their levels had declined significantly more than would be expected from aging alone. Since then, numerous studies have documented the same trend among various age groups. The dip can probably be attributed to a number of factors, including rising obesity rates, widespread chronic disease, and sedentary lifestyles, Scott Selinger, a clinical associate professor at University of Texas at Austin’s Dell Medical School who studies testosterone, told me. Hot testicular temperatures—because of tight-fitting clothes, excessive sitting, or, more dramatically, a quickly warming climate—may also affect testosterone production, Selinger said.

Low testosterone really can be debilitating. Deficiency is linked to low libido, erectile issues, fatigue, heart disease, osteoporosis, anemia, and depression. But the prevalence of testosterone deficiency is hard to define. It ranges from 2 to 50 percent across studies and differs greatly by age. Speaking about men’s-health experts, Abraham Morgentaler, a urologist specializing in testosterone therapy at Harvard Medical School, told me, “I don’t think too many people are really concerned” about population-level declines. Major professional groups whose members study and treat testosterone deficiency—the Androgen Society, the Endocrine Society, the American Urological Association—haven’t launched any specific initiatives to combat low testosterone, Morgentaler said.

They are nonchalant in part because the average decline in testosterone is not especially large. The “normal” range for testosterone isn’t well defined; limits set by different medical societies span from about 300 to 1,000 nanograms per deciliter. The Boston paper found that the average participant’s testosterone levels dropped roughly 50 nanograms per deciliter every eight years or so, “which for some people can make a difference, but for a lot of people, it doesn’t,” Selinger said. Experts are more concerned about what might be driving the decline: “I wouldn’t say there is an epidemic of low testosterone,” Franck Mauvais-Jarvis, an endocrinology professor at Tulane University School of Medicine, told me. “The problem is the epidemic of chronic disease.”

Meanwhile, the number of American men receiving testosterone-replacement therapy has grown by almost 30 percent from 2018 to 2022. In TRT, lab-synthesized testosterone is administered to patients in a variety of formats, including injections, pills, topical gels, and slow-dissolving pellets inserted under the skin of their buttocks or hips. Testosterone, which is a controlled substance, is approved only for the treatment of testosterone deficiency; a diagnosis requires blood work that shows levels below the normal range over multiple days and, crucially, corresponding symptoms. But it’s also easy to get for other reasons. Doctors can prescribe it off-label to men with normal T levels who complain of low energy, decreased libido, or erectile dysfunction. Some gym fanatics buy it, sometimes through illicit channels, to build muscle, which is the only undeniable effect of raising T in someone with normal levels, Morgentaler said. All of the experts I spoke with were dubious that low-T clinics follow standard medical practice for prescribing testosterone, including discussing potential risks with patients and employing hormone specialists. (I reached out to two large testosterone clinics, but they did not respond.)

Whether the goal of these clinics is to treat low T or jack levels up to the max isn’t clear. Many encourage men to aim for excessive T, Michael Irwig, an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School, told me. A 2022 study of seven direct-to-consumer low-testosterone clinics found that three of them proposed a treatment goal of at least 1,000 nanograms per deciliter—one advertised a goal of 1,500. It should come as no surprise, then, that up to a third of men on TRT don’t have a deficiency, and that the majority of new testosterone users start treatment without completing the blood work needed for a diagnosis.

The maximalist approach to testosterone is risky. Although new research dismisses previous concerns about TRT causing cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer, too much of the hormone can elevate levels of hemoglobin, which raises the risk of blood clots, and estradiol, which can cause breast enlargement. It also causes testicular shrinkage and infertility. Although increasing testosterone can improve sexual performance, it has the opposite effect on reproduction, which is why the American Urological Association advises men to be cautious about TRT if they want to have kids. If a man begins testosterone therapy in his 20s and stays on it for upwards of five years, the chances that he’ll ever recover his original sperm levels are low, John Mulhall, a urologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, told me.

Plus, pumping the body full of testosterone may not alleviate the problems that patients set out to solve. Every patient responds to testosterone differently, Mauvais-Jarvis said; some men may feel perfectly fine at levels considered deficient, while others require far higher levels. The symptoms of deficiency could also be caused by any number of common ailments, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and depression. It’s not uncommon for a patient who still feels unwell after starting treatment to ask for more testosterone, Mulhall said. But if his problems have a different root cause, “pushing that man to a T level of 1,000 won’t improve his symptoms.”

The current spotlight on testosterone could lead to better care for men in at least one way: If the FDA removes restrictions on the hormone, more patients will be able to get treatment from their doctors—many of whom are reluctant to prescribe controlled substances—instead of turning to dubious third-party clinics, Mauvais-Jarvis said. This would be especially beneficial for the men who do have a genuine T deficiency but are currently not receiving treatment.

The panic over testosterone seems unlikely to end anytime soon, in part because it is about not just men’s health, but also manhood. The Trump administration is obsessive about manliness. Trump himself—who shared his T level (a perfectly respectable 441 nanograms per deciliter) during his first presidential campaign—has been lauded by his fans as a paragon of masculinity. The message is clear: When it comes to testosterone, more is definitely more.

The fight against ICE in Minneapolis defies easy categorization. Is it activism? Protest? Political opposition? Resistance? None of these terms quite captures what we’re seeing: people putting their own bodies on the line to care for immigrants and impede the operations of a paramilitary force in their city. My colleagues have come up with their own, apt ways to describe it: Maybe this is “neighborism,” or a movement for “basic decency.” I like the way an elderly couple named Dan and Jane, in one dispatch, explained their motive for joining the effort: “humanist.”

The word that comes to my mind is dissidence. If we want to understand why the whistleblowing, camera-wielding people of Minneapolis have caused the Trump administration—and Donald Trump himself—to flinch, I believe we need some added history, and a bigger map. What we’ve been watching is part of a long, established tradition—one that might help Americans unlock a different kind of future.

Dissidence is not revolution; it is not even political opposition. It’s something much more elemental. It emerges in environments where power—usually government power—tramples on the basic conditions of life as people know and value them. We recognize what this means in Minneapolis: People do not like to see their neighbors terrified and rounded up. They do not like to see masked men with guns acting with impunity. They do not like their children being too afraid to go to school. Unlike, say, the “pussy hat” protests that immediately followed Trump’s first inauguration and launched what came to be known as the resistance, the reaction of regular people in Minneapolis is not, fundamentally, about an ideological or policy disagreement with the administration. The movement that has arisen on the city’s frigid streets is about defending what any reasonable American would call “normal”—the expectation of a life without the threat of violence and coercion.

This is when the dissident has always stepped in. Since Trump’s first term, historians have been furnishing us with analogies from the past to help explain our unprecedented political reality—many more people now feel comfortable uttering words such as authoritarianism, even fascism. But when it comes to the mindset and actions necessary to stand up to these forces, the past also provides precedents—and role models—that we shouldn’t ignore. For as long as tyranny has existed, there have been people who resist the pressures of conformity or even the natural instinct toward self-preservation in order to say “no.”

The dissidence of Minneapolis reminds me of the Argentinian mothers who found themselves in an impossible situation during the military junta of the late 1970s. Their children, deemed “subversives” for their work with the poor or their leftist politics, were abducted in the middle of the night, disappeared without explanation. The most obvious choice for each of these mothers was to keep quiet, to avoid drawing attention to her family. But some refused to do so. They started searching and asking questions, and eventually they joined together to stand week after week, year after year, outside the presidential palace with signs that read Where are they?

Today’s dissidence also reminds me of the Underground Railroad. Think of what this network of liberation demanded: all of those innkeepers, church deacons, farmers, and housewives risking violence and potential arrest in a country that was, as Frederick Douglass put it, “given up to be a hunting-ground for slaveholders.” In an environment of terror—the Fugitive Slave Acts made harboring a runaway a federal crime—these individuals conducted their own moral calculus: Slavery was an abnormality, one worth obstructing in any way, at any cost.

This is not a history of people practicing politics or fighting for regime change. It is, in fact, humanist. These people are not looking to replace one governing order or ideology with another. They are fighting an incursion, reacting to a violation of humanity, and deciding to do something about it.

Another dissident comes to mind, a familiar if anonymous one. Most people assume that the man in that famous photo from 1989 who stood in front of a line of tanks near Tiananmen Square was trying to block them from crushing the democracy protests. And that may have been his intent. (No one ever learned his identity or his fate.) But I see something else in that lone figure carrying two shopping bags: a man who is perhaps heading home to prepare dinner, who has a recipe in mind, who has been planning what music to listen to on his cassette player that night and remembering the details of a conversation with his wife, when four tanks suddenly appear in his path. They are blocking his path, not the other way around. The dissident insists on continuing his journey home. He refuses to move out of the way.

The dissident who probably thought most about what it means to be a dissident was Václav Havel, the Czech playwright who, in 1989, became the first democratically elected president of his country. Havel understood dissidence, at its inception, as not being political at all; he considered it, rather, “pre-political.” It could emerge from wanting to play strange music, wear one’s hair long, speak one’s mind, defend one’s economic interests, or protect vulnerable neighbors. When you are not allowed to assert these core aspects of who you are—to be a fully autonomous human—you face a choice: Either abandon those parts of yourself, or refuse to and become a dissident.

One of Havel’s greatest achievements was Charter 77, a petition—and then a movement—that became a sustained opposition to the Communist regime. But he was always quick to point out that what launched the whole effort was the arrest of a band of anemic-looking, long-haired rock musicians called the Plastic People of the Universe. Their only crime, it seems, was wanting to play weird, psychedelic music redolent of Frank Zappa. There was nothing subversive about their songs—many of which were about loving beer—and so it was not hard to appreciate what was being suppressed when the musicians were put on trial and sentenced to prison, nor were the stakes for every free person difficult to understand.

This elemental appeal of dissidence is easier to see when we compare it with the resistance that has marked most of the Trump years. The tactics of activists have largely included mass protests, most recently those of No Kings Day, as well as smaller, simpler ones, say, chanting and ringing bells in front of Tesla showrooms. Such acts are useful for bolstering your own political side, for creating a sense of solidarity. But they don’t usually help widen the circle of opposition. They are more like pep rallies—not without value, but also easy to ignore. The same can be said of the resistance’s main message, which tends to focus on Trump’s threats to democracy and the rule of law. This, too, is not pre-political, because it tends to alienate those who don’t already agree with this dire (if accurate) analysis.

Compare the grievances of these protests with the issues and stakes that dissidents have revealed in Minneapolis. The assault by federal agents was an attack on something pre-political, on parts of our communal existence that people, in normal times, take for granted. You should be able to assume that parents, immigrant or not, won’t be ripped away from children. You should assume that people don’t have to hide in their house because their skin is brown or black. You should assume that filming an interaction with the police won’t end in your death. These are all pre-political assumptions, and we hold them not as Democrats or Republicans, but as individuals who just want to live freely.

Havel, surprisingly, didn’t much like the word dissident and used it, he said, “with distaste, rather ironically, and almost always in quotation marks.” He worried that the label gave the impression that there was some rarefied class of people whose job it was to be “professional malcontents”; dissidents, he insisted, were just “ordinary people with ordinary cares.” What made them special was their defense of those pre-political instincts that we all share. Does the fact that they are defending something so basic diminish what dissidents do? I don’t think so. How many people really are willing to sacrifice so much for the sake of just being human?

When it comes to Trump, we’ve just seen dissidence gain a tactical victory where resistance has failed. The question for those appalled by the actions of this administration has always been how to get more people to share a morally grounded outlook on what is happening to the country. This is hard, to put it mildly. Almost every news event gets filtered through a tribal lens (and the tribalized media that supports it). Even the death of Renee Good, caught on video from multiple angles, was largely interpreted in partisan ways.

But since the killing of Alex Pretti, something has shifted. A wider swath of people are beginning to perceive the state’s violence against its citizens as an abnormality. Just listen to the Republican who dropped out of the race for Minnesota governor in part because of what he was seeing in Minneapolis: “I cannot support the national Republicans’ stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so.” The change could be felt even in Trump himself, who demoted the man running the Border Patrol operation in the city and spoke of the need to “de-escalate a little bit”—not a phrase that’s commonly in his vocabulary. We are a long way from justice for these two deaths, but to judge by polls and even Fox News coverage, many more people now agree that a violation has taken place.

This happened because of the American dissidents in Minneapolis. They have organized outside of the spotlight, and not toward a nationwide mobilization but with a sharp, local focus on their neighbors. They communicate on Signal channels, stand guard outside elementary schools, bring food to scared immigrants sheltering in their homes. They have placed an emphasis on watchfulness, on care, on safety and calculated risk—all qualities that characterized dissidents in the Soviet Union and characterize them today in Tehran and Beijing. Their actions resulted in images that bore moral witness to what federal agents are doing in their city. But they also established a sharp contrast that people with open eyes and goodwill could not fail to recognize.

The American dissidence, should it continue and grow, will need to look different from the resistance of months and years past. It will need to focus on what is common to all of us, what Havel called “the aims of life.” We share many more of these aims than we sometimes realize. We may disagree about tax rates and foreign policy, gun rights and rent freezes, but “normal” is a universal concept in America when it comes to what we expect for our children, our communities, and our sense of security and well-being. To be a dissident in this moment means moving beyond scoring points and underscoring differences, and on to recognizing what we are all losing—and blowing a whistle in order to prevent that loss.

Dissidence might seem to be a lonely act. It has always started that way. But what is called for now is the spirit of that man in Tiananmen Square, that immovable character, a human who insists on getting home to do the things that give his life purpose and will not let a few tanks get in his way.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> The Trump administration is escalating military tensions with Iran, deploying naval assets and demanding a new nuclear deal following a series of military actions in nations like Venezuela and Yemen. While the president uses high-pressure tactics similar to those used in the fictionalized capture of Nicolás Maduro, experts warn that Iran's advanced military capabilities and lack of a clear successor to Ayatollah Khamenei make a potential conflict far more complex and risky than previous operations.

        <hr/>
        The Trump administration is contemplating another attack on a foreign adversary, using a familiar script. Once again, the president has assembled what he described as an “armada” of ships within striking distance of his potential target and has told a nation’s leaders to make a deal—or else. The administration has provided hints at its rationale for military action and indications of what it wants from a deal, which the leaders of the nation in Donald Trump’s sights have summarily rejected. And the president has again said that time is quickly running out.

Such presidential bluster might be dismissed as another example of Trump’s Art of the Deal diplomacy—making exaggerated threats in the hope of forcing a negotiated settlement. But given that less than a month ago, Trump delivered on similar threats by carrying out a stunning, high-risk assault that dragged Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from his palace to a New York prison, another military assault, this time on Iran, is very possible.

At least 11 U.S. naval ships were positioned around Venezuela when the United States struck. Now at least 10 are near Iran, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, which left the Asia-Pacific region two weeks ago and just arrived in the Middle East. Over the past 10 days, the U.S. has also moved aircraft, drones, and air-defense systems to the region, just as it did in the run-up to the attack on Venezuela. And like Maduro, Iran’s leaders are signaling that they won’t agree to terms that the president says will avert a strike, namely swearing off any future work on nuclear weapons. Trump officials have suggested they are considering several targets in Iran but have yet to define what victory would look like or what they plan to do if strikes were to cause the regime in Tehran to fall.

The Navy is “ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary,” Trump said on Truth Social on Wednesday. “Hopefully Iran will quickly ‘Come to the Table’ and negotiate a fair and equitable deal—NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS—one that is good for all parties. Time is running out, it is truly of the essence!” He added: “The next attack will be far worse!”

The threat of military strikes on troublesome regimes has become a hallmark of Trump’s second term. The United States conducted a weekslong campaign targeting Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen last year, followed by targeted strikes on Iran’s nuclear program in June and this month’s raid targeting Maduro. If the U.S. attacks Iran, it would become the fifth country targeted since Christmas, joining Nigeria, Syria, Somalia, and Venezuela.

But another round of strikes on Iran—if Trump ultimately decides to act—would be different and might not deliver the kind of quick military success that the president favors. Tehran has the most advanced military capabilities among the countries that the U.S. has targeted, both in terms of its national military and via its proxies, which pose a threat to American allies in the region. Even if the U.S. wanted to replace the top leader in Iran, as it did in Venezuela, there is no clear successor. Iran is run by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who serves as the supreme religious and military leader.

The fall of the ayatollah could empower the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, a powerful branch of Iran’s security apparatus that operates independently of the nation’s armed forces. Although Trump’s recent threats have centered around nuclear talks, previous statements—as well as military planning—have suggested punishing the regime for its brutal repression of nationwide protests.

U.S. officials told us that targeting those responsible for the repression is under consideration. This could include the National Information Network—the country’s internet-and-tech agency, which imposed a dayslong internet blackout as security forces carried out massacres against protesters. (Elon Musk has offered his Starlink satellite service to Iranian protesters, but access has been limited.) Planners also have looked at targeting whatever remains of the country’s air-defense system, and its ballistic-missile program. Advisers have leaned heavily toward the use of cyberattacks to limit any risk posed to U.S. personnel or military assets. “Chaos and entropy are the only possible path,” one official told us.

What began as an outcry by the Iranian public over the country’s deepening economic crisis, including record-high inflation and the collapse of its currency, the rial, has culminated in the most widespread and deadly uprising since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The regime’s bloodthirsty tactics have testified to its growing desperation, and human-rights activist groups say that anywhere from 6,000 to 16,000 people have been killed.

Trump has repeatedly signaled his willingness to intervene in support of the protesters, telling them via social media nearly three weeks ago that “HELP IS ON ITS WAY.” But there was little he could do at the time: The U.S. military was stretched thin, with its most crucial defensive assets stationed in the Caribbean and Pacific. Since then, the protests have quieted because of the government’s repression, calling into question whether strikes now would reignite the protests and potentially force out the regime—or just intensify violence in Iran and deepen instability across the Middle East.

Trump has demanded a resolution to the two countries’ long-standing disagreements about Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The president said this week that Iran is interested in talks. But Iranian officials have publicly rejected making concessions, instead threatening a swift response to any U.S. attack.

“Our brave Armed Forces are prepared—with their fingers on the trigger—to immediately and powerfully respond to ANY aggression against our beloved land, air, and sea,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote on social media Wednesday evening.

Diplomatic solutions remain possible. Araghchi arrived today in Turkey, which has acted in the past as an intermediary, to meet with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan.

The Iranian foreign minister’s bellicose words should not be considered mere rhetoric, Vali Nasr, a professor of international affairs and Middle East studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told us.

Rather, Iran could be sending the message that it may conduct strikes far bigger than those it launched on an American base in Iraq following the 2020 U.S. assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’s elite Quds Force. It may even go bigger than its retaliatory strikes on Israel after the June attack on its nuclear program.

“In the past, Iran has reacted to U.S. strikes symbolically. There is a chance that Iran will respond this time in a way that they haven’t before,” Nasr said. “They may decide to target U.S. troops or targets in the Gulf or global oil supply—something major. And if that happens, the U.S. could potentially be drawn into a much longer conflict with Iran.” That may be especially true if, weakened by the recent protests, Tehran sees strikes as an existential threat that demands a “Damn the torpedoes” response.

American partners in the Gulf that host U.S. military bases forbid the launching of strikes from inside their borders, so fighter jets or bombers would likely take off from faraway bases or naval ships. Several Gulf allies have warned that U.S. strikes could lead to regional instability and shocks to the global oil economy: The Houthis in Yemen said they would attack ships transiting the Red Sea. IRGC-backed groups in Iraq warned about war. And an online video purported to show members of Hezbollah vowing to fight should Iran come under attack.

“Neighboring countries are our friends, but if their soil, sky, or waters are used against Iran, they will be considered hostile,” Mohammad Akbarzadeh, political deputy of the IRGC naval forces, said, according to the Fars News Agency.

The question of what comes next hangs over any military operation. The Trump administration surprised Venezuela’s democratic opposition by working with Maduro’s lieutenants after the dictator’s capture, with the intention of facilitating a later political transition. Working with the remnants of the Iranian regime would be much more complex, given the Tehran government’s longevity, ideological hostility toward Washington, and hierarchies.

But Iran’s opposition movement is fragmented and, as one Trump-administration official told us, “can’t be in the same room, let alone agree who among them should lead.” The only thing it can agree on is that the clerics need to cede power to the people. Beyond this, its divisions along ideological lines—its movement including monarchists, secularists, ethnic autonomy movements, and militant organizations—are significant. The various factions come to the table with deep historical grievances and conflicting visions for a post-regime Iran.

Political pressure is also coming from Capitol Hill, where Republican legislators told Secretary of State Marco Rubio Wednesday that they are frustrated by the White House conducting major military operations without congressional consent—or even advance notification. During a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, described the January 3 assault on Venezuela as an act of war enabled by an “expansive notion of presidential power.” Although the administration argued that Maduro’s capture was a law-enforcement operation, making a similar case for striking a nuclear-powered adversary such as Iran would be hard.

Rubio told the committee that Iran “is probably weaker than it has ever been,” in large part because it is spending too much on weapons and proxies instead of fixing long-term economic problems. Iran’s currency this week dropped to ⁠a record ‍low of 1,500,000 rials to ‍the ⁠dollar. Yesterday, the European Union labeled the IRGC a terrorist organization in response to its crackdown on protesters.

But Rubio also appeared to signal an off-ramp from the prospect of military action, describing the U.S. buildup of ships, aircraft, and air defenses as a “preemptive defensive option” that was prudent to “prevent the attack against thousands of American servicemen and other facilities in the region and our allies.”

More telling, Rubio acknowledged that the U.S. has no clear succession plan for Iran should strikes tip an already weakened regime out of power. An arrangement like the one the U.S. has with Caracas, he suggested, would be much trickier to pull off.

Rubio told Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican: “That’s an open question.”

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Following the capture and imprisonment of Nicolás Maduro by the United States, Venezuela’s transition under Delcy Rodríguez faces a critical test regarding the release of over 1,000 political prisoners. While the Trump administration has pressured for their freedom, the slow rate of releases from notorious facilities like El Helicoide raises questions about the extent of American influence and whether the regime's repressive apparatus is truly being dismantled.

        <hr/>
        On October 1, fireworks soared from El Helicoide, a sprawling prison complex that spirals around a hill in the center of Caracas. To many of those who knew what went on inside the structure, the spectacle was sickening.

At El Helicoide, guards reportedly hang political prisoners by their limbs and force them to plunge their face into bags of feces. Venezuela has quite a few places like it: Locking up critics was a key feature of President Nicolás Maduro’s governing style. His regime jailed thousands of them—opposition leaders, journalists, activists, foreign nationals, as well as everyday Venezuelans—typically on charges such as “betrayal of the homeland” and “rebellion,” and usually without granting them a trial.

El Helicoide stands out from the other prisons in part because of its history: In the 1950s, architects conceived it as a futuristic mall, but the building went unused until Maduro repurposed it as a series of torture chambers. Some Venezuelans have come to see El Helicoide as the defining monument of Maduro’s rule. With his pyrotechnic display, which came as the Trump administration was intensifying its rhetoric against Maduro and striking boats off of Venezuela’s coast, Maduro seemed to be sending a brazen message: His regime was holding together, and its repression would not relent.

Now Maduro sits in an American prison, and Venezuela is governed by his erstwhile second-in-command, Delcy Rodríguez, under a heavy American hand. What she will do with the repressive apparatus that El Helicoide represents is the question that preoccupies many Venezuelans who hope to leave the Maduro era behind.

According to human-rights organizations, Venezuela held at least 1,000 political prisoners at the time of Maduro’s capture. His reign had become so associated with these detentions that many family members of prisoners told me that as soon as they found out Maduro had fallen, they rushed to the prisons to inquire what would happen to their loved ones. Opposition activists made the detainees’ plight a core issue.

“I think all sectors of Venezuelan civil society have taken up the liberations as our central banner,” Adriana Pichardo, a former lawmaker now in exile, told me shortly after Maduro’s capture. “It’s the most important thing we need in order for Venezuela to have a real transformation.” Local journalists began covering the issue assiduously, scrutinizing public statements for clues as to what would happen to those who were detained.

For much of the Venezuelan opposition, the fate of the political prisoners promises to show both what the Trump administration intends for Venezuela and whether the country has left Maduro behind. Earlier this month, American officials began calling for them to be freed, and Rodríguez seemed to respond, if slowly. According to the human-rights group Foro Penal, the regime released 104 people on Sunday. (President Trump thanked Rodríguez for the “powerful humanitarian gesture.”) The total number of people who have been released this month is now 302. This leaves about 70 percent of known political prisoners locked up, suggesting that either American officials don’t have as much control over the regime as they claim—or that they do and haven’t cared enough to use it.

The Maduro regime used arbitrary detention as one of its primary tools of intimidation. Foro Penal has documented more than 18,000 cases in the past decade of people arrested without legal justification or due process. These include children, people with disabilities, and the elderly, as well as political targets such as opposition leaders and activists. In 2024, police intercepted a private voice message in which a doctor named Marggie Orozco, in referring to the country’s economic crisis, said that the government was “starving us to death.” For her complaint, Orozco received a 30-year prison sentence.

During its first days in power, Rodríguez’s government imprisoned dozens of Venezuelans, including two farmers who had celebrated Maduro’s fall and 14 journalists who had covered the new president’s swearing-in ceremony. Then, three days after Maduro’s capture on January 3, Trump made a passing comment that seemed to cause the regime to change tack.

“They have a torture chamber in the middle of Caracas that they’re closing up,” Trump said during a speech to congressional Republicans, without elaborating. Within hours, Spanish-language news outlets were reporting that Trump had announced the closure of El Helicoide, citing no further evidence than Trump’s verbal aside.

El Helicoide did not close. But Jorge Rodríguez, the president of Venezuela’s parliament and Delcy’s brother, announced on January 8 that the government would release a “significant number” of prisoners. Trump seemed pleased: “Because of this cooperation,” he wrote on Truth Social, “I have cancelled the previously expected second Wave of Attacks, which looks like it will not be needed.”

Over the next two weeks, the government released prisoners at a pace that activists described to me as “drop by drop”—about 10 a day, on average. Rumors spread that many of the remaining detainees were dead. (One of them, Edilson Torres, died at age 52 just days after the releases began.) Some in Venezuela speculated that the government had tortured the prisoners so gruesomely that it was afraid to let the public see or hear from them. Back in 2023, Amnesty International reported that officials had beaten a prisoner until she had to use a wheelchair and forced her to have an abortion.

Zair Mundaray, who worked as a public prosecutor for about 20 years before fleeing the Maduro regime, offered two theories about why the release of Venezuela’s political prisoners has been so sporadic. The first relates to Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, who controlled much of Venezuela’s judiciary before U.S. troops captured her along with her husband. According to Mundaray, his former colleagues who still work for the Venezuelan government say that Flores left behind a power vacuum that no one has been able to fill. As a result, he told me, judicial decision making has slowed. The second theory is that Rodríguez is not herself in any hurry to release these prisoners, which the Trump administration doesn’t seem to mind.

Last week, Rodríguez claimed that the government had released 626 prisoners, but she provided no evidence. She also did not specify whether these were common prisoners or political ones—a distinction that the government doesn’t acknowledge and that has become hard for NGOs to draw. In 2024, the government officially banned groups that track political prisoners, such as Foro Penal. Many of them continue to operate, but their jobs have grown more difficult. Many political prisoners go unclassified because families fear that registering them with an illicit organization would lower their chance of getting out. Since the releases began, though, many people have registered their loved ones. Foro Penal has verified some 200 previously unreported instances of political imprisonment since January 8.

Even when a political prisoner is released, their liberty remains conditional. Edward Ocariz, an activist and former prisoner, told me that many former detainees have to go to court for monthly check-ins. In many cases, authorities use these occasions to rearrest them, Ocariz said. The government also forbids former prisoners from leaving the country or giving interviews to the press, a condition of release that he decided to break at his own risk. He asked me to use the word unjailed to refer to released inmates, not freed.

Last Friday, Venezuela observed a national holiday commemorating the fall of a military dictatorship that ruled the country until 1958. Rodríguez called for a demonstration in Caracas to protest the capture of Maduro—the man who, she suggested, best embodies the spirit of that day.

Not far from the demonstration, in a town near Caracas, people were lining up outside El Rodeo 1 prison hoping to see their loved ones. Each Friday, a queue starts forming at dawn, Lorealbert Gutierrez, a 19-year-old with five relatives in prison, told me. Many visitors bring gifts; Gutierrez usually comes bearing soap. Some visitors aren’t able to get in, and those who do typically wait for hours. Guards blindfold them and escort them to a room where they have 25 minutes to speak with their loved one from behind a screen, under constant supervision.

Massiel Cordones, the mother of a prisoner, wasn’t scheduled to visit her son until Sunday, but she had been camping outside El Rodeo for weeks. As soon as she heard that the government would release some prisoners, Cordones drove seven hours to Caracas. She couldn’t afford a hotel in the capital, so she slept under the roof of a pavilion next to the prison, where vendors sell food to family members of prisoners on visiting days. The first night, she slept on the floor. Then volunteers gave her a mattress.

Cordones’s son is José Ángel Barreno, a 28-year-old army lieutenant. She told me that Barreno never disobeyed his superiors or criticized the government, but he is the nephew of a soldier who defected, so his colleagues distrusted him. In 2020, the regime arrested Barreno while the military searched for his uncle. Authorities first sent him to El Helicoide, where guards administered electric shocks as a form of torture. Yet he told his mother that El Rodeo, where he’s been since 2022, was worse. “He said this was the true hell,” Cordones told me. Cordones sold her house to pay for lawyers and reported her son’s case to Foro Penal.

“You know, when your son is a political prisoner, you are a political prisoner,” she said. “It’s the end of happiness. How can you eat knowing he’s not eating? How can you sleep knowing that he’s cold?”

I first spoke with Cordones on Saturday. She told me she was almost sure that officials wouldn’t let her visit. Earlier last week, she had made a public statement calling out the torture inflicted on prisoners. Cordones feared that authorities would punish her or her son for her outspokenness. But her son had told her many times to carry on talking to the press about conditions inside the prison. She had heard that guards were telling the prisoners that their families had stopped camping outside and were no longer holding candlelit vigils every night. Cordones wanted her son to know that this was not true.

I spoke with her again the following afternoon and found her overjoyed. She had woken up to the news that more than 100 political prisoners had been released in just a single day. And she had gotten to see her son and relay the news. Cordones told me she now felt certain that he’d be released one day. And at the very least, she had gotten to tell him that families were still camping outside and holding vigils—that the political prisoners had not been forgotten.

        For Lowell

There are things which, said and true,

are of this generation’s past;

of fighting freedom’s battles

and of taking off the mask—

stories of the actions taken,

to blot out the blights of sin,

how heroes and the valorous

fought their enemies within,

of turning boldly with the light

to evil’s war against the truth.

And now that struggle is renewed:

given birth and a new youth.

We must fight this same malady

with courage and resolve,

for our nation is the sum

of the action of us all.

Would we be traitors to our

bugle, which beckons with its call?

—

Children used as bait to bargain

with their parents in deceit;

bodies lying lifeless, static,

shot dead, cold, in the street.

This has been the nation’s song.

Read of Adams’s decree:

There’s “Dignity” and “Majesty”

in tea thrown in the sea.

“Something notable And striking,”

he wrote in his diary.

One could not help but to see

an “Epocha in History.”

They quartered troops among them,

amid times of bitter peace,

when that massacre in Boston,

for a nation, stained a lease.

They won freedom for their people

but in fine print said: be damned.

To that man who said, of ham, they’d

“rob old Tony, Doll, and Sam”

the hypocrisy was notable,

and took some years to fight—

those critics of the sheep-stealer,

who in man-stealers delight—

Until those people stole away,

and set fire to freedom’s light.

—

Those things ripple and echo,

blaring loudly on repeat

that which would better a re-

public: from sea to shining sea.

Our nation needed purpose

and it lacked, almighty, God.

He who told of tribulations

warned us of the chastening rod.

As the great believer cautioned,

treachery says up when down;

it “scatters whole families”

without second thought or sound.

        <hr/>
        A writer is a kind of magician. Their job is to create living, three-dimensional people out of the ordinary stuff of ink and paper. This is no easy task, because readers can’t literally hear, touch, or observe a character. Everything that defines a human being in real life—the physical space they occupy, or how they smell, feel, and sound—is stripped away, replaced by description. But authors have one major, mystical advantage: They can show you what’s happening inside of someone’s brain.

First, here are four stories from The Atlantic’s Books section:

The novelist George Saunders makes great use of this asset in his new novel, Vigil. Its narrator, Jill, is a literal mind reader who pops into the heads of people on the edge of death. In Vigil, she watches over the expiring K. J. Boone, an oil magnate who spent his life degrading the Earth and denying the effects of climate change. Readers get to see Boone’s past and present, his brittle family relationships, and all of his self-serving internal narratives. In theory, we have access to everything that makes up this man—every unique facet of his psyche, every cruel word and deed, and, yes, every mitigating circumstance. Yet Saunders “seems unwilling to convey Boone’s more sympathetic attributes without some swift reminder that he’s a bastard,” Julius Taranto writes, with some disappointment, in his essay about the novel for The Atlantic. In the end, he argues, Boone is still rendered in 2-D.

Nonfiction writers also face the challenge of making a person rise out of a paragraph. This is especially interesting in the case of memoirists, who are trying to introduce readers to themselves—sometimes in service of, say, laying the groundwork for a political campaign. In his new book, Where We Keep the Light, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro “is doing what presumptive candidates for the highest office usually do when they write such a book,” my colleague Gal Beckerman writes. “He is laminating his narrative.” Shapiro is presenting a very particular version of himself: average Joe, leader, and, especially, religious man. The Jewish governor intentionally uses the universal word faith, Beckerman writes, as “a bridge between who he is and the people he is trying to reach.”

But is this Shapiro in full? Can his memoir authentically introduce him to America? Probably not: His book is more of a promotional vehicle than a look at the man’s honest soul. But Beckerman and Taranto’s critiques are interesting because of what they imply about more successful books. If Saunders and Shapiro both come short of creating a three-dimensional person, this reminds us that in the best works, the subtle alchemy of summoning succeeds. A writer really can bring a person to life.

George Saunders Brings Morality Back to Fiction

By Julius Taranto

The author’s work makes an excellent case that literature can explore virtue—even if his latest novel reveals its pitfalls.

What to Read

Rangikura, by Tayi Tibble

On a snowy day, you could curl up by the fire with something wholesome and cozy; you could perch by the window with something chilly and somber. Or you could crack open the New Zealand poet Tayi Tibble’s Rangikura, which is none of these things. Playful, forceful, and sexy, it radiates so much heat that choosing it for a holiday read is like fleeing south for the winter. (And in Tibble’s home country, December is summer.) That’s not to say it’s unserious: Tibble reflects on the relentless shame she used to feel about her gender and her Indigenous Māori heritage; she charts how she emerged from timidity like flowers peeking out from a melting blanket of ice. Rangikura is the result of her transformation, and it is a persuasive case for freedom, pleasure, and fun that honors the generations of women in her family who also celebrated, shouted, and danced. “I’m hotter than the sun,” she declares. “And my ancestors ride wit me / like dawgs. When I whistle / they run and run and run.” — Faith Hill

The Accidental Winners of the War on Higher Ed

By Ian Bogost

I texted, emailed, telephoned, and Zoomed with friends in higher-education leadership. Current and former heads of both research universities and liberal-arts colleges confirmed my intuition: Well-resourced and prestigious small colleges are less exposed in almost every way to the crises that higher ed faces.

To dig deeper, I decided to embark on a fact-finding mission in the guise of a traditional college tour. In November, I went to visit four elite liberal-arts colleges—Amherst, Davidson, Smith, and Vassar—where I joined prospective students and their parents for their campus tours, sat in on classes, and spoke with undergraduates, professors, and administrators. Might schools such as these emerge as the accidental winners of the war on universities?

On this week’s Galaxy Brain, Charlie Warzel opens with what it means to live in 2026, when our phones can drop us into graphic, real-time violence without warning—and when documenting that violence can be both traumatizing and politically consequential. Using recent footage out of Minneapolis as a lens, he explores the uneasy collision of algorithmic feeds, misinformation, and the moral weight of witnessing. Charlie also traces how viral documentation can puncture official narratives, pushing stories beyond political circles and even into “apolitical” corners of the internet. Then, Charlie is joined by Amanda Litman, a political digital strategist and the co-founder of Run for Something. They discuss how to be a good citizen in the information war without losing your mind. Specifically: In an age of algorithmic fragmentation and billionaire-owned platforms, does sharing that devastating image or news article actually accomplish anything? Or is it just performative activism? Together they explore how nonpolitical creators and everyday people can be especially persuasive messengers, and how to pair online engagement with offline activism. It’s an episode about how to stay engaged without surrendering your nervous system and how to use the internet as a tool for connection, clarity, and action, not just despair.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

[Music]

Charlie Warzel: I’m Charlie Warzel, and this is Galaxy Brain. For the last few weeks, I’ve been obsessing over a question, the answer to which may be impossible to know: What do we do with this window we have to the world?

We’re living in this moment of genuine chaos in a decade that’s already been full of global conflicts, a botched insurrection, a pandemic, political dysfunction. All of that colliding on an internet full of conspiracy theorizing, synthetic AI slop, endless memes. Our phones bring us delights and numbing distractions, but also fresh horrors every day.

Maybe you, like me, woke up last week and found yourself faced with a series of auto-playing videos of agents mobbing Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Maybe you watched as an agent shot him while he lay on his knees on the street. Or maybe a few weeks ago, your phone showed you the amateur video taken from multiple angles of Renee Good’s last moments before she was shot by an ICE agent at close range. Or maybe you logged on this fall and had to witness Charlie Kirk’s gruesome assassination in your feed.

Social media has enabled us to vicariously witness terrifying scenes. This is especially true in recent weeks in the Twin Cities. Sometimes we seek them out, but other times they find us in moments when we’re especially unprepared to see them. A colleague of mine recounted checking his phone and accidentally stumbling upon an auto-play video of Pretti Saturday morning while at the aquarium with his daughter.

A reality of being alive in 2026 is that you may accidentally open your phone and witness a man being shot to death and then have to figure out how to continue on with your day. The cognitive dissonance here is extremely difficult to sit with. To say nothing of the psychological trauma of witnessing such violence, even if you’re able to stay away from the worst of it. Watching armed, masked agents pulling elderly people out of their homes in the cold or detaining young children—that takes a toll, especially when you close your device and you find yourself back in your own life. The world feels on fire, and your life is just moving on.

It can feel alienating, and it can make a person feel so angry, sad, and ultimately powerless. And yet, the power of this kind of documentation—the kind that’s being performed by observers in Minnesota every day, who are risking their lives to film clashes between agents and protestors—that cannot be understated.

Pretti’s last seconds were captured from multiple angles in sickening footage that was widely distributed on social media and news organizations. It is able, though, to be seen and dissected online precisely because of the observers who were there to document it, who did not drop their phones when the gunshots rang out, and who kept recording when federal agents piled atop Pretti. All of it has had an immediate effect, in countering the administration’s smears that Pretti was a “would-be assassin” who “tried to murder federal law enforcement.” The news and the footage of Pretti’s death managed to break through the usual informational chaos.

On Reddit and Instagram and Facebook pages, the videos of Pretti’s last moments appear to have galvanized people who don’t normally engage or post about politics at all. You have sports-meme pages and golf influencers. The climbing subreddit, knitting accounts, not-safe-for-work pages. I mean, even a Facebook page as apolitical as the “Gravestones of New England” was calling out ICE’s excessive force in the aftermath.

Something has changed.

All of this underscores that if the truth is ever going to win out over propaganda, it can only do so in the face of overwhelming evidence—the collection of which has become ever more treacherous in the second year of Trump’s second presidency.

You can understand the power of documentation and of witnessing, but you can also struggle with how to consume it all yourself. I’m reminded of this great and sobering essay by The New York Times writer Amanda Hess. It’s about witnessing sensitive content videos on Instagram from the conflict in Gaza: this wrenching series of videos and photos of dead children, all on an app dominated by ads and influencers and algorithmically chosen photos of friends doing fun stuff.

Of that, she wrote, “Sometimes, when I tap on a post from a journalist in Gaza, Instagram suggests next steps. ‘Are you sure you want to see this video?’ it asks. It tries to point me instead to ‘resources’ for coping with ‘sensitive topics.’ It suggests a crisis hotline for disaster survivors and responders, but I am not a survivor or a responder. I’m a witness, or a voyeur. The distress I am feeling is shame.”

What Hess is getting at here in part is how what we might witness on our devices isn’t just traumatizing or radicalizing, but it’s also linked explicitly to the specific platforms that serve this content up to us. And these platforms are incredibly fraught curators. Many of them are owned by billionaires with their own political agendas. For example, late last week, TikTok finalized the sale of its U.S. operations to an American investor group. And that includes, among others, Oracle, the private-equity firm Silver Lake, and the investment firm MGX.

Now, this became relevant over the weekend when Pretti was killed, because influencers attempted to upload videos to the platform, criticizing ICE. And some found that they couldn’t do that. Others got the videos up, but noticed they’d received zero views. And that was very suspect. So many of them naturally took to social media to express their outrage. They said that they’d been censored by the new leadership. “With Larry Ellison’s takeover, TikTok is already silencing voices on the left and anti-ICE, anti-Trump content.” That was what the popular podcast I’ve Had It posted on X on Monday morning.

This is just a perfect encapsulation of this moment, right? TikTok noted that it had suffered a data-center outage and that user uploads and views had been affected. The transfer of ownership from ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, to the U.S. ownership group, paired with a data-center outage, might mess with the platform. That’s an entirely plausible scenario. There’s also the fact that nonpolitical content on the platform, like posts from the NFL’s primary account, also showed zero views on Monday, which suggests a broader issue here. But others just refuse to believe that. The only thing in this that is clear right now is that there are so many people who are extremely and understandably wary of TikTok’s ownership and seem to assume at all times that somebody’s thumbs are on the scales.

All of this makes the job of being an informed citizen just tortured. Do you stare at the misery machine? If so, how much? What do you take from it? Is the misery machine real life? Is it not real life? “Don’t be a doomer!” they say. “But also don’t underreact!” The truth out there is probably as bad, maybe even worse, than you think. But if you remove yourself from it all, it’s easy to slip back into something that is like complacency. It is crucial to pay attention right now. It’s also crucial not to lose resolve or get sucked in or traumatize yourself. There’s a real world out there. Touch grass, people say. The real world is likely full of people around you who tether you to your community. People you love, and who love you. But the trauma in our screens—that is also the real world.

So what are we supposed to do with this window to the world? It is such an unanswerable and essential question right now. Sometimes it seems like this window has only made people grow apart, more callous, more self-interested, more addled. And yet that very same window often shows us that people are good and decent and that they care about each other and organize and have these huge reservoirs of empathy.

We’ve seen that in Minnesota this month. So with all that, how should you or I—how should we all—think about posting and consuming and being a good citizen in the information war? To answer that, I spoke with Amanda Litman. She’s the co-founder and president of Run for Something, which is an organization that recruits and supports young and diverse progressive candidates running for down-ballot office. She’s the author of multiple books, including When We’re in Charge: The Next Generation’s Guide to Leadership. And most recently, she’s been writing on her Substack about the ways that people and politicians can calibrate themselves to the internet to feel some agency and make a difference in the world.

She joins me now to talk about it all.

[Music]

Warzel: Amanda, welcome to Galaxy Brain.

Litman: Thank you for having me.

Warzel: So you’ve been in politics awhile as an organizer, a digital strategist. And I get the sense from following you online that you’re a pretty online person, and that you’ve been closely following what’s been happening in Minnesota online. And so I want to start by getting a sense from you of what you’ve witnessed these past three weeks—what the experience has been like watching this—but then also what you’ve been seeing in terms of the broad effect of other people watching this collectively.

Litman: It’s been so interesting, because my algorithm very clearly knows who I am. It knows I like politics, it knows I work in politics, it knows I’m a mom. It’s nice to feel seen in some ways—

Warzel: —by Big Tech—

Litman: —recognition is recognition. But the people I follow are, generally speaking, people who work in politics, for the most part. Or people I’ve met through the political circle. Those folks have been tuned in since the beginning. What I have noticed over the last three weeks, both from the folks I follow from other parts of my life, but also from the cultural creators, especially from the parenting creators, from the book people, from the romance writers, from the other parts of my life that are not politics—and I think this has been true across the internet—is people feeling like the shooting of Alex Pretti is the last straw. That this is the thing where you cannot stay silent. And it has felt so reminiscent of 2020 in that way, in that there is a tipping point where the conversation cannot continue as normal. In a way that I have found shocking, to be honest.

Warzel: Yeah; it’s really wild to see it. I’ve seen it too, and I think a lot of people have remarked on this. In my other life, I like to play golf. And so I follow a lot of people who are golf influencers or whatever, or my algorithm gives me people like that. And that is usually a pretty, like, We’re staying out of politics crew of people, you know? And there was one image I saw posted online of a golf influencer. He’s just at a driving rage, just hitting a shot. And he’s like, This normally wouldn’t be a political account, but golf is political because you can’t play it if you get shot by an agent of the state in the street. And it was like this moment for me of, This has bled through in a really, really shocking way.

Litman: It feels like the conversation has shifted from it being a thing that political people are talking about to a thing that everyone is talking about—in a way that doesn’t feel like it’s happened, honestly, since Jimmy Kimmel was fired. Which feels like the last big cultural moment that sort of broke through, at least in the online space.

Warzel: And so you wrote this piece—this is one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you today—about the politics of posting, and this idea of what we do on these platforms, whether it matters. But I think that this is a great context for it—this idea that there has been this shift. And you wrote it, I think, before Alex Pretti was shot, a day or two before. And you started the piece by describing seeing this now-famous photo of this 5-year-old boy who was detained by ICE. In the image, he’s wearing this little backpack and this hat. And it’s an extremely, I think, difficult thing for anyone to see—but especially a lot of parents. It really broke through online. And you talked about posting that image yourself on your own platforms in order to put some pressure on ICE or raise awareness here. And then you wrote, “But: Did my posting (or any of our posting, on any platform) do anything to further that effort?” Walk me through your process there. Did it?

Litman: Yes and no. I’m not sure if I actually wrote this, but I have come full circle here. Used to be, back in my digital-strategist days—so when I worked for the [Barack] Obama campaign in 2012, that was my first job out of college. I was doing online fundraising. I then did digital strategy for the [Florida] governor’s race and then did online fundraising for Hillary [Clinton]. I was kind of, maybe counterintuitively, Posting doesn’t matter. It is important in that it is participatory, but it doesn’t change things. It’s like, It’s not enough. You can’t just post and be like, “Great job; done!”

Over the last now 10 years of the work I’ve done in seeing how things have shifted, I have moved my barometer for success a little bit. I think in this moment, as you have written so much about, there is no singular media source. Everyone is getting a slightly different algorithm, a slightly different, fractured media diet. They’re seeing something a little bit different. So if I post the picture of Liam Ramos or the headlines from the Minneapolis paper, it might be the only thing that someone sees about that story if they follow me. Even though it feels like my entire newsfeed is 100 percent that, it might be the only thing. And there’s actually some really interesting research about this, that I think Wired wrote about in December: how political content posted by nonpolitical creators has more influence than political creators doing it. Like, it does more to move people to the left, in part because of the parasocial relationship that people have with folks who are talking about golf or parenting or books or whatever it might be.

And like, I’m not a creator; you’re not a creator. We’re not influencers in that same way. Although maybe we are, which is sort of a separate conversation.

Warzel: We’re all creators now.

Litman: But that idea that you—as a trusted source for your friends, your family—they know you. They know where you’re coming from. Seeing you speak up about it—“you” in the broad sense—that can be really, really powerful. And it takes the place of having a conversation in person, that most people are a little bit too afraid to have these days.

Warzel: It’s such a great point about the influencer thing. When you look at—I think this is something, and we can get into this a little later down the line—but when you think about how different ideologies have harnessed the media. Like, there was this whole long conversation after the 2024 election of Who is the Joe Rogan of the left?, right? And the smartest people on this subject who study this type of stuff, who really understand these dynamics, all said, You can’t create that. Because Joe Rogan is a guy who is a standup comedian who started a podcast about standup comedy where he interviewed comedians, then got into mixed martial arts and did that, and built this huge audience that loved and trusted him for whatever reason. And then he started to get interested in conspiracy theories, and then politics. And all of the work that you do for a decade of building that trust in that audience, when you do turn on the politics jet—like as you said—this is such a powerful source for people who have that relationship with them. And I think that it’s really interesting to think about with our social feeds. This happening in a very, one-to-one, very kind of community-level aspect. I think that’s really, really smart.

Litman: Well, and I think there’s a hesitation that some people have, especially after the last five years, of like, I don’t just want to post and have, like, performative activism. I don’t just want to do virtue signaling. I think virtue signaling is good. I think it is good to want to show people you’re a good person. And I write this, like, it feels a little self-righteous. It can be a little bit annoying. But one, the right has tried to make vice signaling very cool. They have tried to make being an asshole and a bigot and a piece of shit on the internet the hot, cool thing, and shame you if you’re a good person. I think that’s dumb. We should be proud of being, of doing good things. And it should be okay to post things that signal your values. And I will tell you, as somebody who runs a nonprofit, if you’re making the donation so that you get the receipt to share: I don’t care. That money spends all the same. It doesn’t matter why you’re doing it, as long as you are doing it and actually taking action in a meaningful way that moves the needle forward.

Warzel: You write that it could also be a way to find your people. I think a lot of people don’t believe that. But can you give the case for finding community through some of these platforms and networks?

Litman: I mean, it’s hard for me personally to articulate this, because everyone knows I work in politics. This is my life. But I hear this from the people who engage with this material all the time, which is like—it’s so validating to see someone say something or post something you agree with in a way that might surprise you. Like, I didn’t know that writer felt that way. I didn’t know that creator felt that way. And especially for people in real life, like, I didn’t know that fellow parent at school that I only follow because we see each other at the playground every so often feels similarly. Now we can have a conversation. Now maybe next time I want to volunteer in a campaign, I could reach out to them.

It often can feel either like screaming into the void or preaching to the choir. But at least when it comes to preaching to the choir, you might reach someone who just didn’t feel like they could sing loud enough, and you might encourage them to speak up. And it feels so cringey to say out loud. It really does. And I get that. But in this moment—especially with the propaganda war that the government is trying to instill—it really, really matters that there’s a different kind of dispersion of information.

Warzel: I think there’s something to the cringey thing. I’ve heard other people say this, so this is not a deeply original thought, but: I think, broadly speaking, the whole idea of cringe is really, I think, toxic. The idea of labeling everything as this. In the same way that virtue signaling is good when the world is full of this vice signaling, when there is a terminal irony that is basically poisoning all these different platforms—and the White House posts like they’re a 4chan moderator or something like that—I feel like cringe is good. Bring us some cringe, right? Because it basically just means you care a lot. And I think that that is something that I would like to see more people not be afraid to show. That they’re caring in that way.

Litman: Rachel Karten had a thing, I think it was last week, about like the Mister Rogersification of marketing this year, of how more and more brands and marketing are moving into Mister Rogers vibes in their social media and leaning into this idea of kindness and hope. And I have been thinking about this a lot, even in 2025. Like, my hottest take is: I think that the Democratic nominee in 2028 is going to be whoever can appropriately balance fight like hell with kindness and joy. I don’t know if you ever see that meme that’s like “The people yearn for Glee.” They just want Glee to be on. We want that Glee joy, like the television show. There is something real to that. It is nice to see nice things. Fear and rage, it just burns you out. Whereas when you remember that people care, and they believe that better things are possible, it makes you feel like you can get out of bed in the morning.

Warzel: Not to put you on the spot, but are there good examples of brands or whatever that have done this? Successfully pivoting to the cringe slightly, or the Mister Rogersification?

Litman: Okay, so I’m gonna quote from Rachel Karten’s newsletter, because I thought it was … like it really spoke to me. She talks about a Nurses Week video from Fig. She talks about Elmo: just checking in, how’s everybody doing? There’s a post from Willy Chavarria, who’s a fashion designer, leaning into the sort of joy that people are experiencing. I think you see this a lot with content creators in particular, talking about the beautiful things in their life. Like, the aesthetics of happiness feel really engaging.

Warzel: And that speaks a little, though, to the tension here, right? I know a lot of people who—I know somebody, a friend, just happens to be, they planned their one vacation for the year, you know, a year ago. And it just happens to be during this time in American life that is just awful and very chaotic, and feels just like, you know, something has shifted and changed. And there’s this, I think everyone makes all these different calculations of Do I post a photo of the beach? Like, Am I a bad person if I’m doing this? And I think it’s interesting to think of it from this lens of, you don’t want to say “The world just goes on,” right? But there is this way of thinking—that sharing and joy. And, I don’t know, there’s a way that you can create community that feels a little generative, as opposed to the constant soul-sucking nature of We are on the brink.

Litman: And not to bring everything in social media and politics back to Zohran Mamdani, but I do think this is something Mamdani did so, so well—which was that his stuff was joyful. Like, it was heavily layered with Millennial optimism and a little bit of cringe in a way that really, especially, spoke in opposition to the way that [Andrew] Cuomo or anyone else was campaigning. If you believe that better things are possible and you are inherently an optimist—because I think to participate in activism, you have to be a little bit of an optimist, even if you hate that about yourself—it is contagious. Because it’s what gives you the forward momentum to keep doing the work. So I had a friend who was doing that too; was like, I just was surfing in Costa Rica, and the world is falling apart. Can I post? I was like, Yeah, of course you can. Because the next day you’ll be back, you know, donating and marching and doing what you can. Post away.

Warzel: Or shoveling snow and doomscrolling; yeah. I wanted to ask broadly, we’ve touched on this in a lot of ways. But something that I have thought so much about—and, to be very candid, like agonized about for the last decade—is: What do we do with this window to the world that we have? I think whether it’s seeing atrocities abroad, as we have for so long, or the dysfunction here at home, there’s a feeling right now that part of just being alive today is being confronted with auto-playing videos of people being shot to death. And that’s something that I think is beyond just being hyper online. If you are in these spaces at all, you may be confronted with fresh, genuine horrors—that if you open yourself to them fully, it’s easy to shut down or to feel just so alienated, because you are going throughout your day, in the way that you are. I’m curious how you think about how we bear witness. How we think about showing and sharing these things with people because they matter to us, and how not to get demoralized in doing so.

Litman: One of my general rules of thumb for online-content consumption, especially as it relates to the news, is to only take the poison I have the antidote for.

Warzel: I love that.

Litman: I can’t always do this. But generally speaking, that means that there are huge parts of the things happening in the world that I just like, I scroll past. There’s nothing I can do about that. That doesn’t mean it’s not important. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter. It’s just the things that I have chosen to dedicate my life and my career and my work to, and my personal outside-of-work interests to, are not that. Now the things that I have—like what is happening in Minneapolis, like what’s happening in the United States, like what’s happening with Trump, like what’s happening in New York City, where I live—yeah, I’m diving deep. But you know what? That’s because I can do something about it. Whether that’s voting in an election, giving money, subscribing to media, thinking about all the different sort of things I could do that affect it. Pick the poison I’ve got the antidote for. And I think the key is remembering that the antidotes, to extend the metaphor a little bit, are more varied than you might think.

I was talking to someone who was telling me they felt so hopeless about what was happening in Minneapolis. They’re like, There’s nothing I can do. This person was like, I’ve worked in politics, worked as a facilitator. It’s so hard, but there’s nothing I can do. I was like, You live in D.C. There’s a D.C. mayoral election in the upcoming year. It actually is going to be really, really, really important who the D.C. mayor is, because this shit is going to come back to your city soon enough. Like, dedicate all of your energy to that. And that—while it might not feel like a direct solution to what’s happening in Minneapolis—that is a solution, and it’s a concrete thing you could do. It’s a thing you can show up in person for. It’s a thing you’ll be able to live the results of. Be expansive in what your idea of antidote is, and it allows you, I think, a little bit more possibility.

Warzel: We’re talking a lot about the personal-political media consumption, how to be online as a person. We’ve also touched, but I want to go deeper on, the idea of politicians and being online. You’ve written a lot about leadership, especially in younger generations: about ways that people can leverage these platforms to connect, to get messages out, but also to inspire people to affect actual political change. And something that I feel, and I think a lot of people feel, is that there are really just—especially when you look at, say, our politicians, they fall into two camps. They’re either hyper-online, really cocooned, troubling edgelords. Or you have people who are kind of thinking and regarding the internet on dial-up terms, right? You’ve said that we need to find elected officials who are the right amount of online. What is the right amount of online for an elected official?

Litman: So I think it’s folks who are enough of a consumer that they can be a producer without the brain rot. Like, J. D. Vance has brain rot. Trump has brain rot. Like, they’re so online that they’re unable to see that it is an ecosystem—an echo chamber that they cannot get out of. They’re sucked into it. And I think there’s actually a lot of, you know, Republican electeds, candidly, who—whether it’s Twitter or Fox News—same idea. Like, there’s not some secret source of information. They’re doing the same shit. We saw that in the photo from the Venezuela attack, or coup, I guess. Where they’re scrolling Twitter as they’re, you know, kidnapping dictators.

Warzel: Right. This is the, sort of, not Situation Room, but the Mar-a-Lago command center during the Venezuela raid, where they are conducting an operation. And Pete Hegseth has a screen behind him that is showing a Twitter feed, or an X feed.

Litman: That is too online. And then, as you say, the politicians who clearly have no idea how the internet works; don’t understand. They don’t know the language of a forward-facing video, so they can’t do it in a way that feels genuine or authentic. Which means they can’t communicate in this moment. That is 80 percent of a politician’s job—is communication. And if they can’t do it in the way that works for 2026, they can’t be a good politician right now. You’ve got some politicians, I think, like AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], Maxwell Frost—I actually think Chris Murphy and Brian Schatz, it’s not all younger—like the ones who are online enough that they know how to use the tools. Even if they don’t actually know how to, like, edit the video themselves. While still understanding that the internet is not real life, but it is a huge part of your life for a ton of people, and it is how people understand real life. Like, it’s a mediation for how we will understand real life.

Warzel: When you see something good from a politician, like a piece of content that they’ve produced or a response, what are some of the flavors of that? Like, what is a taxonomy of a good response or a good post from an elected official? How does that work for you?

Litman: Does it feel like it credibly could have come from them? Do I buy that this is a thing? That even if, like I said, like their Zoomer digital staffer told them, Hey, this is a thing you should have, you should make, we’re gonna edit it—does it feel like it credibly could have come from them? Does it feel like they’re responding to a post that they probably could have seen? Does it look like they’re copy-pasting talking points they’ve been emailed? Which you see politicians often do, and then forget to delete the copy-paste notes on top of, which is such a flag. How much did their staff have to explain to them the format, the function, how it works? One of my favorite questions to ask politicians of any age, but especially the older ones, is “Tell me about what side of the internet you’re on.” What side of TikTok are you on? What Reddit subreddits are you in? Are you on Pinterest? Are you on Ravelry, if you’re a knitter? I don’t know; tell me about the internet that you’re on. And the ones who don’t even understand the question are the ones who are not well suited for this moment.

Warzel: It’s interesting. I once asked—I had an opportunity via The New York Times editorial board to interview Bernie Sanders, and my job was to ask him a tech question. And I was just like, Show me some of the apps on your phone. And he just yelled at me and said he doesn’t have any. And yet, somehow that works, right? Like somehow, there are some people, because he is authentic to that, like Hey man, like, miss me with all of this.

Litman: But you can tell the ones who are actually really good at it don’t do meme-y stuff. Like, they’re not making memes. They’re being, like, genuine personal communicators, who maybe are using different formats and functions. But I think part of it is they so clearly know themselves and know what they believe that the question becomes, What tactics am I using to communicate it? As opposed to, Which memes am I jumping on to become trendy?

Warzel: This is what I noticed, and other people pointed this out, about Mamdani. Again, politics aside. What was so—and also even beyond the “joy” part of it aside—what I thought was so interesting from a media perspective about some of his videos, especially the first ones that he did when he was out in Queens on the street, was he was taking a very popular online form of content. Which is the “man on the street asking random people, with a microphone in their face, some kind of question.” Right? And then that getting chopped up and put online. Like, that’s how we found Hawk Tuah Girl, who became like the other side of it. But he was just asking these questions, about like, Why did you vote for Donald Trump in 2024, right? And having that man-on-the-street thing. It’s that fluency with a type of content that people are familiar with, but it’s also a type of content that you can do in your own way that is not going to, or that is going to then spread naturally, right? Because the internet is primed to take that type of content and just get it out to a lot of different people. I thought that was a really great example of pairing form, regardless of even the politics, with something that is actually gonna spread.

Litman: Well, and that’s because he’s the right amount of online. Like, that’s a dude that has an FYP that is carefully calculated to his interests. And he’s talked about this. And I think that is telling of a guy who, at the very least, knows the language. Like, he can speak enough of it that he can get by. And I think that is true for so many of the politicians who are really effective in this moment—is they’re good enough. They’ve done enough days on Duolingo to get by.

Warzel: They’re not being guilted by the Duolingo owl logo. That’s very important, I think, in general. So if you could give advice—and I’m sure you are—but if you could give advice to the Democrats right now. And that’s even just like in choosing candidates, like how important is that part of it, like the online strategy in assessing overall whether a candidate’s gonna be good. Obviously you don’t want a candidate who is just hyper online and great at it and, you know, not good at the realpoliticking or whatever. But how do you—how should they judge that? That category “being online”?

Litman: I don’t want to say it’s everything. But I think it is a bigger part than most people would like to admit, because I think, one, it’s how people get information. But two—as we learned with Joe Biden—if you cannot effectively sell the good stuff you’re doing, it doesn’t matter how good the stuff is. Like, you’ve got to be able to continually communicate in all the ways people get information, in all of the platforms. And part of that is being sufficiently online.

But it’s also being a normal person who can show up in nonpolitical spaces and still be a normal person. I think a lot about how many members of Congress could credibly go on basically any nonpolitical podcast—chat show, influencer—and not sound like a robot. Maybe a dozen? If you’re being generous. Which doesn’t mean they’re bad people or bad politicians or bad legislators. It just means that the skillset for what you need to be an effective leader in 2026 is not the same skillset that you needed in 1990 or 2000 or even 2010, when a lot of these folks got elected. And I think it’s the same thing that you’re seeing CEOs struggle with, too: where if you are too online as a CEO, you will suffer. But if you’re not online enough, you’re not gonna know how to perpetuate the brand; you’re not going to know how to sell the work. You’re not going to know even how to influence internal communication, which is driven off of external communication, in many ways. It really matters.

Warzel: Something that I really appreciate about your writing on this entire subject is always that it draws back to IRL, right? It’s always focused on the idea of actual civic engagement, actual community. The stuff that we do online driving change in the real world. You’ve written about things —you’ve written a long list on one of your Substacks of things that people can do. Some of it is political; some of it is civic engagement and relationship building. Can you tell me some of the things that you have found most helpful in just building community, and giving people just a broader sense of agency?

Litman: Go to a city-council or school-board or library-board meeting. Go to a state legislative hearing. Go to a neighborhood cleanup. Stock your neighborhood fridge, if it has a free fridge. Participate in mutual aid. Support a local artist. Buy something from a local artist. Share the thing that you bought online, so that more people can buy things from that local artist. Subscribe to local media. Bring a dish to someone who just had a baby or lost a loved one, or just because. Start a neighborhood group chat. Sustain the neighborhood group chat and make sure it’s not that annoying. My favorite one—and I’ve written about this a lot, it’s sort of like the other thing that I’ve been clinging to this year—

Warzel: I think I was gonna ask you about this one. Is this your experiment?

Litman: Yeah.

Warzel: Tell the people.

Litman: In 2025, and I’ve written about this a bunch and talked about it lately, my husband and I—in order to combat our new-parent isolation—decided to host people for dinner every Saturday in 2025. Every Saturday we were in town, which since we started the year with a 2-year-old and a two-month-old, was every Saturday, because we didn’t travel with them. And we ended up succeeding. We had 52 dinners. More than 100-some-odd people came to our home over the year, 40-some-odd kids. And it was hard in many cases, but so magical. And as I think about, like, Okay, what happens when ICE comes to New York—which they will, they are, I see it in the neighborhood chats already. Like, When they send tanks rolling down Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn—not a crazy thing to say might happen at some point in the next couple years—who are the people that I’m gonna text? Who are the people I’m gonna turn to? It’s the folks who’ve come over to my home for dinner, and their friends, and their networks. I described it as the most political thing I did in 2025. And I am a political operative who voted in two different elections in 2025—thank you, New York City—and give money and read and engage. Having people over for dinner was the most political thing I did. And as I read about what’s happening in Minneapolis, I feel even more affirmed in that. Like, building strong relationships with the people around you is what will get us through this.

Warzel: What did you learn about being social in 2025, 2026? This era where people do feel really isolated a lot? There is a quote-unquote “loneliness epidemic,” however you want to describe it. What did you learn about being social from having 52 dinners at your house?

Litman: One, that it really surprised people to be invited over. People were shocked that we were inviting them into our home. Two, that the tone that we set really mattered. How casual could we make it? I’d often text people morning of to be like, Hey, just FYI, one of my children is not wearing pants and I’m still in my pajamas. See you later. Like, being really aggressive about making it clear—this is not fancy; this is as real as it can get. Because it’s all we can do at this stage in our lives. But come into our home anyway.

I would say some of the questions that I’ve gotten since I’ve written about this and posted about it—because always be posting—really have stunned me. People would ask, like, So what did you talk about? Books, movies, vacations, our kids, the dog, all kinds of things. But I do think that social muscle—and I don’t mean to embarrass anyone by saying that, it’s a real question—that social muscle has so clearly atrophied, and you so deeply overthink it to the point that you have forgotten that actually you can just let go. Not to Mel Robbins you, but you can just let it go.

Warzel: You know, I love—I’m probably butchering it, but I believe it’s like a [Kurt] Vonnegut quote. I think it’s like, The humans were put on this earth to to fart around is the quote, right? And it’s like, I think about that. I thought of it when I read your post, and I think about it sometimes when I am out with my community, engaging in whatever. And a lot of that time is like … it’s not structured, right? It’s not like, “Here’s the list of what we’re gonna talk about today, and the eight political actions we’re gonna take, and the 12 things.” It’s like, I almost sometimes can’t remember what we talked about, right? But it’s this, leave with this feeling of, like, That was so great and unproductive, because it was unproductive. It’s like a wonderful thing. And it feels like it’s something that we just like, we need to have. Just that unstructured hang.

Litman: It’s really hard to be on your phone when it’s just four or six people in your house hanging out and having dinner, drinking wine, whatever it might be. Which I think is also big part of this; it’s two or three hours in which I am not on the internet. And I wish that was more of my life. I wish I was better about not being on my phone. But like, especially when people are over, it is so valuable to unplug. So valuable.

Warzel: Well, I think we will let people unplug by wrapping this. Amanda, thank you.

Litman: Excellent segue.

Warzel: I’m trying. This is still new to me here. We’re working on it. Amanda, this is lovely. Thank you so much for helping people try to understand how to use these tools to feel like a person in the world, instead of being tossed by the algorithmic winds. Thank you so much.

Litman: Well, it’s my pleasure. I would just say—I know it feels bad. We’re winning. We’re going to win. I think that’s the thing I’ve taken away from the last couple days of the internet. It’s like—they’re not popular. What they’re doing is not popular. They’re getting cat-bongo Reddit subthreads to vocally disagree with them. They are not popular. This is terrible, but we will win. And I find that to be really comforting.

Warzel: Amanda, thank you so much. Really appreciate it.

Litman: Thanks.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, suggests his group has receded from street protests because the Department of Homeland Security is now performing similar roles. The article argues that the second Trump administration has effectively institutionalized the tactics of extremist militias within federal agencies like ICE and Border Patrol, using mass-deportation teams to intimidate immigrants and left-wing activists with militaristic force.

        <hr/>
        “We’ve kind of gotten what we want, right? There’s no reason to fucking protest,” Enrique Tarrio, a longtime leader of the Proud Boys, told me earlier this week over the phone while he was taking a minute to charge his Tesla. We were speaking about why his group had receded from the streets. His answer: He no longer felt compelled to show up with other Proud Boys to fight left-wing protesters, because the federal government was doing the job itself.

A year ago, it seemed that the Proud Boys and other right-wing extremists were poised for a renaissance. These groups had been in a lull because much of their leadership, including Tarrio, was imprisoned for involvement in the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. But at the beginning of his second term, President Trump issued pardons and commutations to some 1,500 of the rioters. Having once told the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by,” Trump has now effectively opened the way for extremist militias—with their signature assault rifles and tactical gear—to antagonize local populations, especially immigrants, as they had in Portland and elsewhere.

And indeed, groups of armed men have been roaming the streets intimidating immigrants, violently confronting protesters, and claiming an authority beyond the purview of state or local law enforcement. This time, though, the men belong to the Department of Homeland Security’s mass-deportation teams. Their tactics bear striking similarities to those of the Proud Boys and other militias that showed up in U.S. cities during Trump’s first term. Clad in the same tactical vests, cargo pants, sunglasses, and neck buffs pulled over their faces, some 3,000 federal agents deployed to the streets of Minneapolis with catastrophic results.

Homeland Security’s mandate, of course, is to protect the border, find people who are in the country illegally, and facilitate the deportation of undocumented immigrants, in theory targeting the “worst of the worst.” The Proud Boys showed up at events ostensibly to stand up for immigration enforcement, among other things. But often the result was fistfights with left-wing protesters and anti-fascists. The federal agents and militia members have displayed the common goal of relentless intimidation—of immigrants and the left—and have used militaristic tactics in their confrontations. (Both, too, are currently unpopular and out of step with the majority of the American public.)

These similarities aren’t a coincidence. They are a demonstration of how DHS and its agencies have melded the views and tactics of the extremist fringe with the apparatus and authority of the federal government. The White House, instead of giving the Proud Boys and others tacit permission to intimidate the left as it did in the first Trump administration, has effectively created its own in-house militia to replace the Proud Boys and harass their common opponents. Extremists have stepped out of the way to let ICE and Border Patrol do the work. When I asked DHS about this dynamic, Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s spokesperson, called the observation “irresponsible” and “shameful during a serious moment for our country.” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson similarly replied over email that “The Atlantic should be ashamed of themselves.”

“Immigration was a central and polarizing issue in 2016. It continues to be a central focus of the guys,” Tarrio told me. He described his group’s prior role as doing the things law enforcement wasn’t allowed to do in the first Trump administration. “There were times when the feds weren’t allowed to do their job,” Tarrio said. “Here, ICE is doing its job no matter what.”

ICE and the Border Patrol can pursue these aims with the resources that independent right-wing groups could only dream of. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed last summer, gave ICE $75 billion in extra funding. Both Vice President Vance and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller in recent months have said agents have legal immunity. The Department of Justice has done little to investigate agents’ actions, including the killing of two civilians, instead focusing on what officials claim the victims did wrong.

Legal experts doubt the immunity claim, and the administration this week somewhat softened its rhetoric and approach in Minneapolis. (Vance has since claimed that he never said “officers who engaged in wrongdoing would enjoy immunity.”) The agents who shot Alex Pretti are currently on administrative leave, and the administration’s border czar, Tom Homan, said yesterday that he plans to “draw down” ICE and Border Patrol’s presence in the city. Regardless, the administration’s comments suggest that agents will at least receive significant support for any legal challenges they may face over their actions.

The similarities among ICE, the Border Patrol, and the Proud Boys and similar groups have prompted the question of whether any Proud Boys have joined the agencies. Last month, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations published a report citing the account of an American citizen who had been detained by ICE, who claimed to have “noticed several of the agents had tattoos that expressed support for the Proud Boys.”

Tarrio was noncommittal when I asked him directly about Proud Boys in ICE. “I’m sure some of the guys have applied,” he told me, but added that “if they did join ICE, we’d probably be quiet about it, because they’d probably get fired if they were publicly a Proud Boy.”

Now that ICE and Border Patrol have left them with less to do, the Proud Boys have adjusted their tactics. Tarrio told me that he was considering going to Minneapolis in disguise, with a few other Proud Boys, for the purpose of “gathering a little bit of intelligence” on the people protesting ICE. When I last spoke with Tarrio, in September, he was in the midst of another plot that also did not involve having a visible presence: He and a small group of Proud Boys were organizing digital campaigns to get people fired from their jobs for making insensitive statements about Charlie Kirk’s assassination. (Tarrio’s ability to muster a large Proud Boys presence is in jeopardy given his past as a federal-government informant, and many no longer regard him as the group’s leader.)

But the extreme far-right ethos the Proud Boys espouse has seeped into the federal government. Nativist ideologies are driving immigration policy; the government is calling out and antagonizing specific communities of color, such as Haitians in Ohio and Somalis in Minnesota. DHS is disseminating white-supremacist propaganda on its official media channels.

That blurring of the lines is sowing the conditions for an uptick in political violence, which is already at its highest level in decades.

Sean Westwood, a professor and the director of the Polarization Research Lab at Dartmouth College, explained to me that state violence typically occurs in ways that can be processed and absorbed by the public, like a police officer clearly acting in self-defense or a prison executing a convict on death row. But these justifications don’t apply to the killings of Renee Good, who had turned the wheel of her car away from her assailant, and Pretti, who never drew a weapon and was disarmed before he was shot. The extra risk of such wanton actions by the state is the sparking of retaliatory violence, Westwood said, much as the National Guard killing of four Vietnam War protesters at Kent State University in 1970 triggered national unrest.

Tarrio told me he thinks ICE is doing a great job, and said retaliation from the left is the one thing that could potentially bring him and his fellow Proud Boys back out. Which raises the possibility that at some point in the future the government’s agents and Tarrio’s militia members could join forces on the streets of an American city.

        <hr/>
        Updated at 8:25 p.m. on January 30, 2026

Reporters, lawmakers, and ordinary Americans are poring over a deluge of new files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case today, following the latest release from the Department of Justice. This release is substantially larger than any previous ones, with 3 million pages of documents, more than 180,000 photos, and more than 2,000 videos, according to the DOJ. The website they were uploaded to—which has the elegant URL Justice.gov/Epstein—is not intuitive to operate and offers a search box as its primary navigation tool.

But a search box was the only thing many viewers needed, as they were diving into the files in pursuit of information on specific people—President Trump in particular. Thousands of the documents appear to mention Trump, though not all of them in any significant way (for example, The New York Times notes that some of the documents are copies of news articles that contain his name). When Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the file release earlier today, he said that the White House had “nothing to do” with their vetting and “no oversight.” The DOJ press release further emphasizes the independence of the process and says that “notable individuals and politicians were not redacted in the release of any files.” The only redactions, according to the release, were those made to protect victims and their families.

Reporters sifting through the files have found plenty of news. They’ve turned up a series of emails that Epstein wrote about Bill Gates and then sent to himself in 2013. In these, Epstein suggests that he helped Gates have extramarital affairs and expresses disgust that Gates would “discard” their friendship after asking Epstein to do things “that have ranged from the morally inappropriate to the ethically unsound” and “potentially over the line into illegal.” (The Gates Foundation has already issued a comment to the Times that the claims—“from a proven, disgruntled liar—are absolutely absurd and completely false.”) Many other notable people appear in the files, including Bill Clinton, who was also also in previously released photos. A number of the documents referencing Clinton are uncorroborated tips sent to the FBI. A friendly email exchange between Epstein and Elon Musk turned up, as did a reference to Kevin Warsh, Trump’s preferred candidate to replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair. (Both Bill and Hillary Clinton have refused to testify for the House Oversight Committee’s Epstein investigation, and they recently released a joint statement saying that they’ve already shared “the little information” they have about Epstein. Musk and Warsh did not immediately respond to requests for comment.)

The files about such a sensitive and complicated series of crimes could be released to the public only by way of a convoluted procedural process, but the process came to seem suspiciously convoluted to many Americans in large part because of the president’s many reversals and evasions. Before Trump returned to office, he expressed a somewhat relaxed attitude about the Epstein files. Asked on the Lex Fridman Podcast in September 2024 whether he would release them if he were reelected, he said, “Yeah, I’d be inclined to do the Epstein; I’d have no problem with it.” Early last year, to demonstrate his dedication to truth-telling and transparency, Trump invited MAGA influencers to the White House, where they received binders full of Epstein-related documents labeled Phase 1. But some of the influencers were chagrined to find that the files inside were not new.

Then, in May, Trump reportedly learned from Attorney General Pam Bondi that he himself was mentioned in the unreleased files. Two months later, his attitude about them had dramatically changed. When the FBI announced in July that it had reviewed all of its Epstein files and would not release any more after all—that there would be no Phase 2—both Trump’s enemies and the MAGA faithful were aghast. But Trump was defiant and dismissive. “This guy’s been talked about for years,” he said to a reporter. “Are people still talking about this guy, this creep? That is unbelievable.” His resistance to releasing any more information caused a schism among his supporters (and contributed to the resignation of his longtime ally Marjorie Taylor Greene) and set Congress up for an easy win. Lawmakers moved quickly to pass a law that required the release of all further documents by December 19. Now, weeks past the deadline, the file dump has arrived.

After months of rumors about why Trump so stridently demanded that everyone move on from the Epstein files (and speculation that anything else he did was an effort to distract from them), people immediately latched onto a six-page FBI memo included in the dump that, at least on the surface, seemed to lend credence to their darkest guesses. The memo contained a spreadsheet full of uncorroborated tips sent to law enforcement, many alleging Trump’s participation in violent sex crimes involving minors, and some including graphic descriptions of their allegations. The document—which has already been widely shared by politicians and political commentators—includes some brief details about how law enforcement followed up on the tips but not about whether the tips were resolved. It also includes a note that some of the reports were “second-hand information.” (Trump has downplayed his past relationship with Epstein and denied any wrongdoing.)

This spreadsheet was salacious enough on its own, but then it was briefly unavailable on the Justice Department’s website, prompting people who had already downloaded it to start re-uploading it to other sites, recirculating it on social media, and speculating that it had been deliberately pulled down for political reasons. “DOJ has since killed this link,” the reporter Jake Tapper wrote on Bluesky, sharing a screenshot of the memo. “This is what was there.” (The document is currently loading on the DOJ site without a problem.)

Reached for comment, the DOJ spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre told me that the FBI memo had been “down due to overload and is back online.” She did not immediately respond to a follow-up email asking for more detail. Baldassarre also directed me to a section of the original DOJ press release about these documents. It notes that everything that the FBI received from the public was covered under the scope of law and had to be released, even if the information was unvetted. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the press release continues. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Very neutral wording. (The White House’s press team referred me to this same release when I contacted them for comment.)

Trying to parse market reactions to world events can feel a bit like armchair psychology. Lately, investors seem to be holding something back—amid a barrage of potentially seismic decisions from the White House, markets have barely budged.

In moments of global instability, traders usually start selling. President Obama’s threats to Syria during his second term gave traders “jitters.” Trump’s escalating trade war with China during his first term deflated the stock market. And last spring, when Trump unveiled “Liberation Day”—a plan to impose punitive tariffs on dozens of foreign nations—the S&P 500 shed a record $5 trillion over two days. It remains the biggest market shock of the president’s second term so far.

But the reactions to three headlines from this past month tell a different story. When U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on January 3, reviving an old protocol for dominance in the Western Hemisphere, the markets held strong. When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell revealed on January 11 that he was under criminal investigation by the Justice Department, and that the central bank’s independence was potentially under threat, markets responded with startling calm. And when Trump proposed a raft of European tariffs on January 17, as part of an effort to seize Greenland from our Danish allies, the market reaction, although noticeable, was far from catastrophic.

The fact that traders haven’t reacted so dramatically to volatility in 2026 is partly the product of better-than-expected economic growth in 2025. Although consumer prices remain high and job growth is slow, most experts will tell you that the American economy is in pretty good shape: The S&P 500 grew 16.39 percent last year; unemployment, although higher than when Trump took office, is still relatively low; and inflation isn’t expected to balloon over the coming year. (Prophecies of a recession turned out to have been wrong.)

Traders are weighing Trump’s actions against that rosy backdrop, and have lately been acclimating to the president’s caprice. The “TACO” theory (short for “Trump Always Chickens Out”) emerged as a way to describe his tendency to overpromise. But the markets’ resiliency over the past month indicates a more all-encompassing anhedonia.

Ahead of the mission to extract Maduro from Caracas, Trump suggested that U.S. intervention in Venezuela was intended to free up the country’s oil reserves, which are thought to be the largest in the world. It seemed possible that American companies would barrel up those trillions of gallons of oil, increasing global supply and lowering prices—a boon for purchasers and a potential problem for the energy companies already facing an oversupply problem. But because this all unfolded early on a Saturday morning, and oil-futures trading doesn’t open until Sunday evening, investors had a slight buffer.

Josh Lipsky, the chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council, told me that energy traders understood pretty quickly that there wouldn’t be “some influx of oil coming on.” American oil companies were reluctant to pour money into Venezuela given the country’s crumbling infrastructure, its history of political instability, and the cost of refining its low-quality reserves. A protracted battle over the country’s leadership also seemed unlikely, meaning that the effects of Maduro’s capture would largely be felt locally. After a moment of initial uncertainty, the markets quickly recovered—a muted reaction to what could have been a much larger, and much costlier, event.

The revelation that the Justice Department had subpoenaed the Federal Reserve chair posed an entirely different sort of risk. In a video message announcing the news, Powell accused Trump of persecuting him over his refusal to lower interest rates as quickly as the president would like. The Fed is famously independent from daily politics, which is part of its strength, and the dollar’s strength; Trump’s attempt to assert control over it could have severe economic consequences. There was a chance that, after Powell’s announcement, traders would start to price in that danger.

But as with the Maduro operation, this happened on a weekend, and markets had a buffer. That same night, Trump distanced himself from the DOJ’s investigation, and Senator Thom Tillis (a member of the Senate banking committee) came out strongly against it. Krishna Guha, the vice chair of the investment-research firm Evercore ISI, told me that had those developments not occurred, the market could have “responded very violently.” But by Monday afternoon, traders had barely reacted.

Something about Trump’s social-media proposal to put tariffs on European nations spooked markets more than the investigation of Powell or the capture of Maduro. Once again, the news arrived on a weekend. When trading resumed, stocks did noticeably decline, and the dollar weakened—but the 2.1 percent dip in the S&P 500 was nothing close to what happened after the “Liberation Day” announcement. When the president reneged on his Greenland-tariff plan last week, markets steadied.

“I think that we got a little taste of how bad things would have been if the administration had continued along the escalation path,” Guha said. According to John Canavan, the lead market analyst at Oxford Economics, that initial dip was likely compounded by a spike in Japanese-long-term-bond yields. Investors may have also learned their lesson from the slight pullback that followed last year’s “Liberation Day” panic; some of those proposed tariffs were eventually paused, reduced, or delayed. Although many of the big ones remained in place, it became clear that Trump was essentially using the threat of economic devastation as a negotiation tactic.

The economists I spoke with stressed that although these three cases are distinct, on the whole, markets have become more inured to the Trump administration’s actions. For now, the fate of Americans’ 401(k)s is not tied to the president’s Truth Social account. But that could always change; just this week, the president wrote that the United States has deployed a “massive armada” to the Middle East in an attempt to force Iran to end its nuclear weapons program. Financial markets are in the business of pricing threats—and Trump will surely keep them coming.

        <hr/>
        Good evening.

On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June. That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings.

I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.

This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.

This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.

I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.

Thank you.

        <hr/>
        It was the (up)shot heard ‘round the world. In May, The New York Times’s data blog, having conducted a lengthy review of scholarly assessments of the meal that Americans have been told, time after time, is the day’s most important, declared what many had known, in their hearts as well as their stomachs, to be true: “Sorry, there’s nothing magical about breakfast.”

The pre-emptive “sorry” was an appropriate way both to soften the announcement and to sharpen it: Breakfast—when to eat it, what to eat for it (cereal? smoothies? cage-free eggs fried in organic Irish butter?), whether to eat it at all—has long been a subject of intense debate, accompanied by intense confusion and intense feeling. “Breakfast nowadays is cool,” the writer Jen Doll noted in Extra Crispy, the new newsletter from Time magazine that is devoted to, yep, breakfast. She wrote that in an essay about her failed attempt to enjoy pre-noon eating.

But breakfast wasn’t always cool. People of the Middle Ages shunned it on roughly the same grounds—food’s intimate connection to moral ideals of self-regimentation—that people of the current age glorify it; later, those navigating the collision of industrialization and the needs of the human body came to blame hearty breakfasts for indigestion and other ailments. Breakfast has been subject to roughly the same influences that any other fickle food fashions will be: social virality, religious dogmas, economic cycles, new scientific discoveries about the truth or falsity of the old saying “you are what you eat.” And all that has meant that the meal associated with the various intimacies of the morning hours has transformed, fairly drastically, over the centuries. Our current confusion when it comes to breakfast is, for better or worse, nothing new: We in the West, when it comes to our eggs—and our pancakes, and our bacon, and our muffins, and our yogurt, and our coffee—have long been a little bit scrambled.

* * *

The Europeans of the Middle Ages largely eschewed breakfast. Thomas Aquinas, in his Summa Theologica, lists praepropere—eating too soon—as one of the ways to commit the deadly sin of gluttony; the eating of a morning meal, following that logic, was generally considered to be an affront against God and the self. Fasting was seen as evidence of one’s ability to negate the desires of the flesh; the ideal eating schedule, from that perspective, was a light dinner (then consumed at midday) followed by heartier supper in the evening. People of the Middle Ages, the food writer Heather Arndt Anderson notes in her book Breakfast: A History, sometimes took another evening meal, an indulgent late-evening snack called the reresoper (“rear supper”). The fact that the reresoper was taken with ale and wine, Anderson writes, meant that it was “shunned by most decent folk”; that fact also might have contributed to breakfast’s own low status among medieval moralists, as “it was presumed that if one ate breakfast, it was because one had other lusty appetites as well.”

There were some exceptions to those prohibitions. Laborers were allowed a breakfast—they needed the calories for their morning exertions—as were the elderly, the infirm, and children. Still, the meal they took was generally small—a chunk of bread, a piece of cheese, perhaps some ale—and not treated as a “meal,” a social event, so much as a pragmatic necessity.

It was Europe’s introduction to chocolate, Anderson argues, that helped to change people’s perspective on the moral propriety of breaking fast in the morning hours. “Europe was delirious with joy” at the simultaneous arrival, via expeditions of the New World, of coffee, tea, and chocolate (which Europeans of the time often took as a beverage), she writes. Chocolate in particular “caused such an ecstatic uproar among Europe’s social elite that the Catholic Church began to feel the pressure to change the rules.” And so, in 1662, Cardinal Francis Maria Brancaccio declared that “Liquidum non frangit jejunum”: “Liquid doesn’t break the fast.”

That barrier to breakfast having been dismantled, people started to become breakfast enthusiasts. Thomas Cogan, a schoolmaster in Manchester, was soon claiming that breakfast, far from being merely acceptable, was in fact necessary to one’s health: “[to] suffer hunger long filleth the stomack with ill humors.” Queen Elizabeth was once recorded eating a hearty breakfast of bread, ale, wine, and “a good pottage [stew], like a farmer’s, made of mutton or beef with ‘real bones.’”

The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century—and the rise of factory work and office jobs that accompanied it—further normalized breakfast, transforming it, Abigail Carroll writes in Three Squares: The Invention of the American Meal, from an indulgence to an expectation. The later years of the 1800s, in particular, saw an expansion of the morning meal into a full-fledged social event. Wealthy Victorians in the U.S. and in England dedicated rooms in their homes to breakfasting, the BBC notes, considering the meal a time for the family to gather before they scattered for the day. Newspapers targeted themselves for at-the-table consumption by the men of the families. Morning meals of the wealthy often involved enormous, elaborate spreads: meats, stews, sweets.

With that, the Victorians met the Medieval edicts against breakfast by swinging to the other extreme: Breakfast became not a prohibition or a pragmatic acquiescence to the demands of the day, but rather a feast in its own right. And that soon led to another feature of industrialization, Carroll writes: the host of health problems, indigestion chief among them, that people of the 19th century and the early 20th came to know as “dyspepsia.” They weren’t sure exactly what caused those problems; they suspected, however, that the heavy meals of the morning hours were key contributors. (They were, of course, correct.)

Here were the roots of the current obesity epidemic—the culinary traditions of active lifestyles, imported to sedentary ones—and they led to another round of debates about what breakfast was and should be. Fighting against his era’s preference for heavy breakfasts, Pierre Blot, the French cookbook author and professor of gastronomy, stipulated that breakfast that be, ideally, as small as possible. He also argued that it should, when consumed at all, consist of meats (cold, leftover from the supper the night before) rather than cakes or sweets, which rotted the teeth. (Blot further advised against taking tea with breakfast—water, coffee, milk, and even cocoa were preferable—and prohibited liquor.)

Blot was echoed in his advice by the Clean Living Movement that arose during the Jacksonian era and that has remained as a feature of American culture, in some form, ever since. The movement, which emphasized vegetarianism and resisted industrialized food processes like the chemical leavening of bread, also recommended abstinence from stimulants like coffee and tea. It led to products like Sylvester Graham’s eponymous “crackers”—made of the whole grain that, Graham thought, would curb sexual appetites along with those of the stomach—and helped to make cereal a thus-far-enduring feature of the American breakfast table. (The irony that the “cereal” of today is laden with sugar and chemicals would surely not be lost on Graham or on his fellow Clean Living proponent, John Harvey Kellogg.)

The cereals invented by Graham and Kellogg and C.W. Post became popular in part because they could simply be poured into bowls, with no cooking required; soon, technological developments were doing their own part to turn the laborious breakfasts of the 19th century into briefer, simpler affairs. The advent of toasters meant that stale bread could be quickly converted, with the help of a little butter and maybe some jam, into satisfying meals. Waffle irons and electric griddles and the invention in Bisquik, in 1930, did the same. Those appliances and other cooking aids made breakfast more convenient to produce during a time that found more and more women leaving the home for the workplace—first in response to the labor shortages brought about by the World Wars, and then on their own accord.

But breakfast also became more fraught. During a time that found Betty Friedan equating cooking with the systemic oppression of women, the morning meal forced a question: Could women both win bread and toast it? Breakfast presented a similar challenge for men: In the 1940s and 1950s, Anderson notes, amid the anxieties about traditional gender roles that the post-war climate brought about, cookbooks aimed at men emerged in the marketplace. They suggested how to cook breakfasts, in particular, that would be composed of “manly” foods like steak and bacon. They proposed that eggs be fried not in pats of butter, but in “man-sized lumps” of it. Even baked goods got masculine-ized: Brick Gordon, in 1947, recommended that male cooks might, if baking biscuits, eschew ladylike rolling pins for … beer bottles.

Today, those anxieties live on, in their way: Breakfast remains fraught, politically and otherwise. (And that’s not even outside of the slow-poached minefield that is brunch.) The current debates, though, tend to address not gender roles, but rather considerations of health—for the individual consumer, for the culture in which they participate, and for the planet. The low-fat craze of the 1990s, the low-carb craze of the 2000s, today’s anxieties about animal cruelty and environmental sustainability and GMOs and gluten and longevity and, in general, the moral dimensions of a globalized food system—all of them are embodied in breakfast.

        <hr/>
        Vern Loomis, a retired structural draftsman in West Bloomfield, Michigan, had a standard office lunch: a peanut-butter sandwich, with various fruit, vegetable, and dessert accompaniments. He ate this, he estimates, nearly every workday for about 25 years.

His meal underwent slight modifications over time—jelly was added to the sandwich in the final five or so years—but its foundation remained the same. The meal was easy to prepare, cheap, and tasty. “And if you happen to be eating at your desk … it was something that was not too drippy,” he told me, so long as one applied the jelly a bit conservatively.

Last year, Loomis retired from his job but not his lunch, which he still eats three or four days a week (now with sliced bananas instead of jelly). “I never stopped liking it,” he says. “I still do.”

Loomis may be uncommonly dedicated to his lunchtime ritual, but many share his proclivity for routine. One of the few existing surveys of people’s eating habits estimated that about 17 percent of British people had eaten the same lunch every day for two years; another indicated that a third of Brits ate the same lunch daily. But it’s hard to say for sure how common this really is, since these surveys tend to have been conducted by food purveyors, who might be inclined to exaggerate the ruts that diners are stuck in (and then try to sell them a way out). Still, loyalists who stick to a single meal for months or years—they are out there.

Some of them are public figures whose monotonous diets have been revealed in interviews—they are college-football coaches, fitness-chain CEOs, TV personalities, fashion designers, dead philosophers, Anderson Cooper. Depending on the context, eating the same thing every day can come off as a moderately charming quirk, an indictment of one’s lack of creativity, or a signal of professional focus and drive.

Whatever the symbolism, these people’s behavior is not doing them harm. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University and the author of several books about nutrition and the food industry, says the consequences of eating the same lunch every day depend on the contents of that lunch and of the day’s other meals. “If your daily lunch contains a variety of healthful foods,” she says, “relax and enjoy it.”

So there is nothing wrong with this habit. In fact, there are many things right with it. I spoke with about half a dozen people who, at one time or another, have eaten the same thing for lunch every day. Together, their stories form a defense of a practice that is often written off as uninspired.

Many of the people I talked with emphasized the stress-reducing benefits of eating the same thing each day. Amanda Respers, a 32-year-old software developer in Newport News, Virginia, once ate a variation on the same home-brought salad (a lettuce, a protein, and a dressing) at work for about a year. She liked the simplicity of the formula, but the streak ended when she and her now-husband, who has more of an appetite for variety, moved in together six years ago. Would she still be eating the salad every day if she hadn’t met him? “Oh heck yeah,” she told me. “It would’ve saved so much time.”

Sharilyn Neidhardt, a photo editor in New York City, once found solace in regularity. About a decade ago, she switched jobs, and her new one stressed her out. “There were phones ringing constantly and there were people yelling all the time,” she recalls. One thing that Neidhardt found soothed her and gave her a measure of control over her day: She picked up a spicy noodle dish called tantanmen from the same ramen restaurant every lunch break. She did this for “a minimum of six months,” after which she got tired of the meal (and its cost) and, perhaps more important, settled into the new job.

Eating the same thing over and over can also simplify the decisions people make about what they put into their bodies. Currie Lee, a 28-year-old resident of Los Angeles who works in retail, has some food allergies, and keeping her lunch unchanged “makes it easy” to eat around them. For about six months, at her previous job, she brought overnight oats every day; her current go-to is a turkey sandwich with hummus, avocado, arugula, and cheese, on gluten-free bread.

Lee’s eating habits are not just a function of her allergies, though. She likes that eating the same thing makes grocery shopping simpler, brings consistency to her sometimes chaotic schedule, and made it less likely she’d spend the money at the “$12-salad place” near her previous office. Besides, she really likes the things she brings. “I’m not eating, like, a PB&J every day,” she says. “I try to make it taste good and interesting.” (I did not tell Vern Loomis what Lee apparently thinks of his lunch.)

Chloe Cota, a computer engineer in New York City, does not have as strict a lunchtime regimen as others described in this story, but she has noticed that when her company brings in catered lunch, she always picks a salad when it’s available. She came to think of this default selection as reducing her “cognitive overhead”—a way of not expending mental energy on something that wasn’t a high priority for her.

“Lunch variety doesn't really matter to me,” she says. “I would be perfectly happy to eat the same Caesar salad or peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich every day.” Similarly, she has devised a standard “work uniform” (one of her many pairs of black leggings, plus a T-shirt), which helps streamline her morning routine. She says she took inspiration from tech moguls such as Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg, who essentially automated their own daily attire decisions in the name of reducing cognitive overhead.

The salad station, Cota says, is also an opportunity for her to practice “mindful eating,” something she started doing as part of her recovery from an eating disorder she developed in high school. She says it helps to know that the foods available to her in that moment are ones she knows she likes, which “short-circuits that whole negative space in my brain where I might get back into those disordered behaviors.”

For some people, the repetition in their daily food preparation is in the meals they make for other people. Ambreia Meadows-Fernandez, a 26-year-old writer in Cheyenne, Wyoming, cooks the same meal—“a meat and rice,” sometimes with some vegetables—for her 3-year-old son most nights of the week. “It made it simple in a way that there was less stress about what to give him,” she says. He usually gets a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich for lunch, and doesn’t seem to mind the lack of variety.

Of course, most people around the world who eat the same thing every day aren’t doing so voluntarily. “I would say most people most of the time have little choice in their staple,” says Paul Freedman, a historian at Yale and the author of Ten Restaurants That Changed America. “If they live in a rice culture, they will have rice for every meal; ditto potatoes.” The cooking fat used—say, butter or ghee—generally remains the same as well.

The variety, Freedman says, usually comes from “relishes,” the food-anthropology term for flavor-adding ingredients such as spices, vegetables, and modest amounts of meat (like bacon). “This staple + fat + relish combination is what dominated eating in traditional peasant cultures,” he wrote in an email.

When I asked Krishnendu Ray, a food-studies scholar at NYU, about dietary variety, he said: “Newness or difference from the norm is a very urban, almost postmodern, quest. It is recent. It is class-based.” So, when accounting for the totality of human experience, it is the variety-seekers—not the same-lunchers—who are the unusual ones.

I should reveal that my interest in this subject is not purely philosophical. Nearly every workday for the past five or so years, sometime during the 1 o’clock hour, I have assembled a more or less identical plate of food: Bean-and-cheese soft tacos (topped with greens, salt, pepper, and hot sauce), with baby carrots, tempeh, and some fruit on the side. And almost invariably, I see the same colleague in our communal kitchen, who asks with delight, “Joe, what are you having for lunch today?” The types of bean and cheese rotate, as does the fruit—which depends on the season—but I do not inform my co-worker of these variations when I laugh off her very clever and funny question.

The people I talked with recounted similar experiences of having co-workers harmlessly joke about their meals, like “How was that sandwich today, Vern? Did you use crunchy or plain?” Currie Lee’s former colleagues, aware that she adored horses, found her regular meal particularly amusing, saying things like “Oh, there’s Currie with her oats.”

Lee thought these comments were just regular workplace small talk. But perhaps there is more to them, and eating the same thing each day reveals something deeper about who people are, or at least perceived to be. Amanda Respers, the yearlong eater of salads, says that “we bring a little bit of home when we eat lunch at work,” and naturally people’s outside-of-work identities are a subject of interest. What does eating the same thing each day say, then? “No offense, but it gives the impression that you’re a little bit boring,” she says.

Personally, I think Respers is on to something, though I’d draw a slightly different conclusion. The daily rituals of office life are characterized by their monotony and roteness, and bringing a different lunch each day is a sunny, inspired attempt to combat all the repetition. I do genuinely appreciate the optimism of those attempts. But in my mind, eating the same thing for lunch each day represents a sober reckoning with the fundamental sameness of office life. It seems like an honest admission that life will have some drudgery in it—so accept that and find joy elsewhere instead of forcing a little bit of novelty into a Tupperware and dragging it along on your commute.

But I am probably overthinking this. Ultimately, I am partial to Vern Loomis’s analysis of what prompted his co-workers to poke fun at his peanut-butter sandwich: “Maybe [they did so] just out of good humor, or maybe guilt that they’re not eating as healthy—that they’re eating a greasy burger or something—or going out and spending $15 for a lunch when mine only cost 80 cents.”

“Jealousy,” he concluded. “I think it’s jealousy.”

        <hr/>
        There’s no good reason you can’t eat a chicken-parmesan hoagie for breakfast. That’s what I decided last year when I woke up one morning, hungover and ravenous, craving the sandwich’s very specific combination of fried chicken cutlet, melted mozzarella, and tomato sauce. “Breakfast food,” as a category, suddenly felt like my middle school’s dress code: unnecessarily prim and preordained by people whose rules I should no longer heed.

I wrestled with the idea while summoning the wherewithal to leave bed. Why did a breakfast chicken parm seem so louche to me when an egg sandwich—a similar combination of protein, dairy fat, grease, and carbohydrates—seemed so benign? If I marched up to the counter at my local bagel shop, which makes chicken-parm sandwiches for lunch, could I even order one at nine in the morning? If I succeeded, would it open a Pandora’s box of forbidden-food hedonism from which I could never return? Why was breakfast food even breakfast food in the first place?

My pep talk to myself was for nothing. When I ordered, the counter attendant didn’t seem to care about my brave departure from the useless strictures of American breakfast. I wolfed down my sandwich with unrestrained joy. Since childhood, I’d mostly disliked cereal, oatmeal, and yogurt, which always put me at odds with breakfast as a concept. Now I knew I had been right all along. Any insistence that only certain foods are appropriate for the day’s first meal was silly.

“Breakfast food” might be an arbitrary concept in America, but it’s a distinct one: cereal with milk, a cup of yogurt, eggs, muffins, fruit, oatmeal, juice. Maybe pancakes or waffles on the weekend, if you have some extra time. There are some regional variations, like bagels or biscuits, but the menu tends to be far more predictable than lunch or dinner. And although American breakfast isn’t nutritionally or philosophically cohesive, how the country goes about its morning meal isn’t a mistake. Modern breakfast in the United States tells the story of more than a century of cultural upheaval.

American breakfast begins in Europe, which provided the food norms imported by early colonizers. There, the day’s first meal had emerged from centuries of prohibition under the Catholic Church. “There was a period of time in England and western Europe where eating breakfast was sort of tied to gluttony,” says Heather Arndt Anderson, the author of Breakfast: A History. That all changed with the Protestant Reformation, when morning sustenance became more broadly permissible, if not all that exciting, or even distinct from everything else people ate. Lack of refrigeration meant the meal was usually sour and tepid. In Germany, beer soup was common.

In early America, breakfast remained a matter of convenience for most people: bread; preserved meats; repurposed leftovers; and things, like eggs, that were easy to prepare and regularly available to rural families, Arndt Anderson says.

According to Krishnendu Ray, a professor of food studies at New York University, that’s consistent with how much of the world still approaches the day’s first meal. “Poorer people everywhere, especially in places like India and China, eat the same kind of food for meal after meal,” he says. “The strict differentiation of meals is partly an American thing, but partly a thing of upward mobility.” Breakfast food, as a concept, is a luxury. As colonial America developed into a more robust culture with distinct class markers, breakfast started to change with it.

At first, this evolution was slow. America was a growing country, but technological limitations in both communication and food preparation meant that the morning meal was a largely regional concern, dictated by crops and livestock, as well as the previous day’s leftovers. In at least one sense, a college student waking after a night out and scarfing down two slices of unrefrigerated pizza rapidly aging in their delivery box is actually just participating in what breakfast has historically meant to billions of people.

The alarm with which Americans now commonly regard eating day-old, unrefrigerated food started to develop as the Industrial Revolution changed food preservation, the workday, and cultural conceptions of health. Arguably no one was more directly responsible for these shifts than the Kellogg brothers, who developed Corn Flakes in the late 1800s as an outgrowth of John Harvey Kellogg’s work at his Battle Creek Sanitarium, in Michigan. Kellogg was a doctor and an adherent of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, which advocated a bland, vegetarian diet and abstention from things like caffeine and alcohol.

Although historical tellings tend to emphasize that Corn Flakes were designed to steer people away from sexual thoughts, Arndt Anderson says they also served other Adventist aims. “It was tied to the health benefits of having a little grain to get your morning constitutional,” she says. Kellogg was “really interested in getting people to poop.”

Corn Flakes might not have been so pivotal without a few other results of industrialization: the proliferation of advertising, and the rapidly expanding accessibility of refrigeration (for milk) and cheap sweeteners (to make anti-masturbation Corn Flakes marketable to children). The first half of the 20th century is when breakfast’s class elements start to take hold in the U.S., Ray says. Refrigeration was a luxury, and although the ingredients in cereal might be cheap and nutritionally hollow, brand-name versions have always been pricey. “The most expensive part of cereal-making is shoving it down people’s throats by advertising,” he explains. “I don’t think cereal would have been successful without the massive propaganda of the industry.” A morning bowl of Cheerios—and the ability to buy special foods, just for breakfast—became a signal of sophistication.

Cereal, along with many other packaged breakfast foods, had another factor in its favor: how technological innovation changed labor in America. “The Industrial Revolution really standardized the times at which people work,” says Arndt Anderson. That also helped standardize when they ate, and how much time they had to prepare and consume food. Formalized labor also lengthened commutes and, eventually, integrated women—formerly housewives or domestic servants—into the workforce in enormous numbers after the Second World War.

With these shifts came the eventual displacement of traditional breakfast foods, like bacon and eggs, from the workweek to weekend brunch. Although long considered quick and convenient, these foods “are relatively more labor-intensive in the morning,” Ray says. Industrially produced breakfast products, like cold cereal, yogurt, and instant oatmeal, dramatically reduced the time and effort required of working women to feed their family, and the skyrocketing sugar content and colorful mascots made them an easy sell to most kids (and, therefore, most harried moms).

In the 1980s, nutritional scaremongering over fat consumption helped cement sweetened, industrialized grain and dairy products as morning go-tos. Although America’s relationship with dietary fat has moderated in recent years, moralistic fears over whether any given breakfast is “good” aren’t easily parsed, and the 10 minutes people might have to slam a Chobani before work aren’t the ideal time to reconsider the often-conflicting evidence. Eggs, for instance, have been hyperbolically hailed as both a nutritionally complete superfood and a heart attack in a shell. But Ray says there’s scant dietary explanation for the way we eat in the morning now: “There’s no good reason why we should have so much sugar in the morning, or something cold.” In fact, the value of eating breakfast at all isn’t exactly settled science. Its role as the “most important meal of the day”? All marketing.

Even though the average American conception of breakfast is unnecessarily stringent, it’s unlikely to loosen anytime soon. Breakfast’s hasty preparation and Americans’ muddled understanding of confusing nutritional news make the meal resistant to change. “Food is a domain of habit,” Ray says, and that’s particularly true for the morning meal. “People are just waking up, and they need their caffeine-delivery system and they need their cereal and they don’t want too much thinking about it.” He has noticed American-style breakfasts spreading to places like India and China in much the same way they took over this country during the 20th century: as a mixture of convenience and class marker while labor forces modernize.

It took the Industrial Revolution, a couple of world wars, and women’s lib to get the United States to the breakfast menus it has today, and it would likely take a similarly seismic shift to free Americans from their cereal or yogurt routines in any meaningful way. But that doesn’t mean you can’t free your mind, as long as you can find a nearby sandwich shop willing to make anything on its menu all day.

        I Broke Breakfast

The American conception of breakfast is unnecessarily stringent, Amanda Mull argued last week: “There’s no good reason you can’t eat a chicken-parmesan hoagie for breakfast.”

The German beer soup Amanda Mull references as a regular on German breakfast tables after the Protestant Reformation is delicious and highly nutritious, and keeps you going all day. However it takes quite some time to prepare. Try this old recipe from 1800, which is really easy to cook:

A strong slice of wholemeal or mixed bread on the side is delicious!

Enjoy!

I very much enjoyed this article and sent it to my boyfriend. A big shock for him when we moved in together was my strong adherence to the idea of a breakfast salad: arugula, cheese, and two fried eggs when in a rush, with the potential for tomatoes, onions, sweet potatoes, and really anything else when not. It has protein, fiber (Kellogg’s would perhaps approve), and the egg yolk is a fantastic dressing. He was formerly an adherent of the yogurt-with-granola school of thought. Now, a frequent deal during rainy mornings is that he’ll cook the eggs and veggies if I walk the dog!

We’ve both found a good breakfast salad to be key for keeping excess sugar out of our diets and making sure we get enough vegetables. It’s easier to have vegetables in the morning from your own fridge before you leave the house than to coordinate a transfer of an additional serving for lunch—and it sets your day on a good trajectory.

My mother was Pennsylvania German and she thought nothing of having peach pie for breakfast with milk poured over it. It confused my first-generation American father, who’d grown up surrounded by his Scottish family. Oatmeal was breakfast. Eggs were breakfast. Pie was not breakfast. My mother could have cared less and just kept on being herself her whole life.

Now that both of them are gone, I try to not beat myself up when I wake up, run through my possible choices for the morning—all good and tasty—but really just want a grilled cheese sandwich made with mild cheddar and extra sharp white on Alvarado sprouted bread.

Having lived in Asia and Europe, I can say unequivocally that American breakfast is king. In fact, it is the only scrap of pride I can cling to when my Japanese, Chinese, French, and other friends regularly disparage the low quality of American food. They are almost right. Many other cuisines are much healthier and more varied and refined than American food. But nobody does breakfast like we do. I can list dozens and dozens of possible morning options Americans can opt for. Yes, some are unhealthy (I’m looking at you, pancakes and syrup), but many are not, and the selection is heavenly. After more than a decade in Japan, I’d be happy to eat only Japanese food for lunch and dinner for the rest of my life (and be healthier for it). But pretty much the only eating experience I crave from home is a big breakfast at a diner. Nowhere else I’ve been even comes close in the morning.

With Trump, the endless War on Terror, and our hegemonic cultural exports—not to mention our notoriously bad food—it can be tough being an American abroad sometimes. Please don’t take away the one true shining point of greatness we have.

Until recently, I resisted using the F-word to describe President Trump. For one thing, there were too many elements of classical fascism that didn’t seem to fit. For another, the term has been overused to the point of meaninglessness, especially by left-leaning types who call you a fascist if you oppose abortion or affirmative action. For yet another, the term is hazily defined, even by its adherents. From the beginning, fascism has been an incoherent doctrine, and even today scholars can’t agree on its definition. Italy’s original version differed from Germany’s, which differed from Spain’s, which differed from Japan’s.

I accepted President Biden’s characterization of the MAGA movement as “semi-fascist” because some parallels were glaringly apparent. Trump was definitely an authoritarian, and unquestionably a patrimonialist. Beyond that, though, the best description seemed to be a psychological one propounded by John Bolton, Trump’s first-term national security adviser: “He listens to Putin, he listens to Xi, he listens to how they talk about governing unburdened by uncooperative legislatures, unconcerned with what the judiciary may do, and he thinks to himself, Why can’t I do that? This doesn’t amount to being a fascist, in my view, [or] having a theory of how you want to govern. It’s just Why can’t I have the same fun they have?”

Writing a year ago, I argued that Trump’s governing regime is a version of patrimonialism, in which the state is treated as the personal property and family business of the leader. That is still true. But, as I also noted then, patrimonialism is a style of governing, not a formal ideology or system. It can be layered atop all kinds of organizational structures, including not just national governments but also urban political machines such as Tammany Hall, criminal gangs such as the Mafia, and even religious cults. Because its only firm principle is personal loyalty to the boss, it has no specific agenda. Fascism, in contrast, is ideological, aggressive, and, at least in its early stages, revolutionary. It seeks to dominate politics, to crush resistance, and to rewrite the social contract.

Over Trump’s past year, what originally looked like an effort to make the government his personal plaything has drifted distinctly toward doctrinal and operational fascism. Trump’s appetite for lebensraum, his claim of unlimited power, his support for the global far right, his politicization of the justice system, his deployment of performative brutality, his ostentatious violation of rights, his creation of a national paramilitary police—all of those developments bespeak something more purposeful and sinister than run-of-the-mill greed or gangsterism.

When the facts change, I change my mind. Recent events have brought Trump’s governing style into sharper focus. Fascist best describes it, and reluctance to use the term has now become perverse. That is not because of any one or two things he and his administration have done but because of the totality. Fascism is not a territory with clearly marked boundaries but a constellation of characteristics. When you view the stars together, the constellation plainly appears.

Demolition of norms. From the beginning of his first presidential run in 2015, Trump deliberately crashed through every boundary of civility; he mocked Senator John McCain’s war heroism, mocked fellow candidate Carly Fiorina’s face, seemingly mocked the Fox News host Megyn Kelly’s menstruation, slurred immigrants, and much more. Today he still does it, recently making an obscene gesture to a factory worker and calling a journalist “piggy.” This is a feature of the fascist governing style, not a bug. Fascists know that what the American Founders called the “republican virtues” impede their political agenda, and so they gleefully trash liberal pieties such as reason and reasonableness, civility and civic spirit, toleration and forbearance. By mocking decency and saying the unsayable, they open the way for what William Galston has called the “dark passions” of fear, resentment, and especially domination—the kind of politics that shifts the public discourse to ground on which liberals cannot compete.

Glorification of violence. Every state uses violence to enforce its laws, but liberal states use it reluctantly, whereas fascism embraces and flaunts it. Trump thus praises a violent mob; endorses torture; muses fondly about punching, body-slamming, and shooting protesters and journalists; and reportedly suggests shooting protesters and migrants. His recruitment ads for ICE glamorize military-style raids of homes and neighborhoods; his propaganda takes childish delight in the killing of civilians; and we have all seen videos of agents dragging people out of cars and homes—partly because the government films them. Like the demolition of civic decency, the valorization of violence is not incidental to fascism; it is part and parcel.

Might is right. Also characteristic of fascism is what George Orwell called “bully-worship”: the principle that, as Thucydides famously put it, “the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” This view came across in Trump’s notorious Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump showed open contempt for what he regarded as Ukraine’s weakness; it came across explicitly, and chillingly, when Stephen Miller, the president’s most powerful aide, told CNN’s Jake Tapper: “We live in a world, in the real world, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world that have existed since the beginning of time.” Those words, though alien to the traditions of American and Christian morality, could have come from the lips of any fascist dictator.

Politicized law enforcement. Liberals follow the law whether they like it or not; fascists, only when they like it. Nazism featured a “dual state,” where, at any moment, the protections of ordinary law could cease to apply. Trump makes no secret of despising due process of law; he has demanded countless times that his opponents be jailed (“Lock her up!” chants, with his endorsement, were a prominent feature of his 2016 campaign), and he has suggested the Constitution’s “termination” and said “I don’t know” when asked if he is required to uphold it. His single most dangerous second-term innovation is the repurposing of federal law enforcement to persecute his enemies (and shield his friends). No prior president has produced anything like Trump’s direct and public order for the Justice Department to investigate two former officials, or like his blatantly retaliatory prosecutions of James Comey and Letitia James. “At least 470 people, organizations and institutions have been targeted for retribution since Trump took office—an average of more than one a day,” Reuters reported in November (and today one can add others to the list, beginning with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell). Had Trump done nothing else, his demolition of independent and apolitical law enforcement would still have moved the U.S. government closer than ever before to a fascistic model.

Dehumanization. Fascism draws its legitimacy from its claims of defending the people from enemies who are animals, criminals, brutes. Trump characterizes (for instance) political opponents as “vermin” and immigrants as “garbage” who are “poisoning the blood of our country” (language straight out of the Third Reich). Vice President Vance, as a senator, endorsed a book called Unhumans (a title that refers to the left). And who can forget his false claim that Haitians abduct and eat pet cats and dogs?

Police-state tactics. Trump has turned ICE into a sprawling paramilitary that roves the country at will, searches and detains noncitizens and citizens without warrants, uses force ostentatiously, operates behind masks, receives skimpy training, lies about its activities, and has been told that it enjoys “absolute immunity.” He more than doubled the agency’s size in 2025, and its budget is now larger than those of all other federal law-enforcement agencies combined, and larger than the entire military budgets of all but 15 countries. “This is going to affect every community, every city,” the Cato Institute scholar David Bier recently observed. “Really almost everyone in our country is going to come in contact with this, one way or the other.” In Minneapolis and elsewhere, the agency has behaved provocatively, sometimes brutally, and arguably illegally—behaviors that Trump and his staff have encouraged, shielded, and sent camera crews to publicize, perhaps in the hope of eliciting violent resistance that would justify further crackdowns, a standard fascist stratagem. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s recent appearance with a sign reading One of ours, all of yours seemed to nod toward another fascist standby, collective punishment—as did the administration’s decision to flood Minneapolis with thousands of officers after residents there began protesting federal tactics, a prioritization that was explicitly retributive.

Undermining elections. Trump’s recent musing that there should be no 2026 election may or may not have been jocular (as the White House has maintained), but he and his MAGA supporters believe they never lose an election, period. They went to great lengths to overturn the 2020 election, as the prosecutor Jack Smith’s indictment of Trump and subsequent report detail ad nauseam. Rigging, stealing, or outright canceling elections is, of course, job one for fascists. Although Trump is term-limited, we must not expect that he and his MAGA loyalists will voluntarily turn over the White House to a Democrat in 2029, regardless of what the voters say—and the second insurrection will be far better organized than the first.

What’s private is public. Classical fascism rejects the fundamental liberal distinction between the government and the private sector, per Mussolini’s dictum: “No individuals or groups outside the State.” Among Trump’s most audacious (if only intermittently successful) initiatives are his efforts to commandeer private entities, including law firms, universities, and corporations. One of his first acts as president last year was to brazenly defy a newly enacted law by taking the ownership of TikTok into his own hands. Bolton understood this mentality when he said, “He can’t tell the difference between his own personal interest and the national interest, if he even understands what the national interest is.”

Attacks on news media. Shortly after taking office in 2017, Trump denounced the news media as “the enemy of the American people,” a phrase familiar from dictatorships abroad. His hostility never relented, but in his second term, it has reached new heights. Trump has threatened broadcast licenses, abused his regulatory authority, manipulated ownership deals, filed exorbitant lawsuits, played favorites with journalistic access, searched a reporter’s home, and vilified news outlets and journalists. Although Trump cannot dominate news media in the United States in the way that Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has done in Hungary, he is running the Orbán playbook. No other president, not even Richard Nixon (no friend of the media), has used such blatantly illiberal tactics against the press.

Territorial and military aggression. One reason I held out against identifying Trumpism with fascism in his first term was Trump’s apparent lack of interest in aggression against other states; if anything, he had seemed shy about using force abroad. Well, that was then. In his second term, he has used military force promiscuously. Of course, many presidents have deployed force, but Trump’s explicitly predatory use of it to grab Venezuela’s oil and his gangster-style threat to take Greenland from Denmark “the easy way” or “the hard way” were 1930s-style authoritarian moves. The same goes for his contempt for international law, binding alliances, and transnational organizations such as the European Union—all of which impede the state’s unconstrained exercise of its will, a central fascist tenet. (Mussolini: “Equally foreign to the spirit of Fascism … are all internationalistic or League superstructures which, as history shows, crumble to the ground whenever the heart of nations is deeply stirred by sentimental, idealistic or practical considerations.”)

Transnational reach. Like authoritarians generally, fascists love company; the world is safer for them if there are more of them. In his second term, Trump has broken with long-standing U.S. policy by dialing back support for human rights while praising and supporting authoritarian populists and illiberal nationalists in Serbia, Poland, Hungary, Germany, Turkey, El Salvador, and Slovakia, among other places—and by being weirdly deferential to the strongman Russian President Vladimir Putin. Even more striking is his de facto alignment against America’s liberal allies and their parties in Europe, which he holds in contempt.

Blood-and-soil nationalism. A fascist trademark is its insistence that the country is not just a collection of individuals but a people, a Volk: a mystically defined and ethnically pure group bound together by shared blood, culture, and destiny. In keeping with that idea, Trump has repudiated birthright citizenship, and Vance has called to “redefine the meaning of American citizenship in the 21st century” so that priority goes to Americans with longer historical ties: “the people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War,” as he put it, or people whom others on the MAGA right call “heritage Americans.” In other words, some Americans are more volkish than others.

White and Christian nationalism. While Vance, Trump, and MAGA do not propound an explicit ideology of racial hierarchy, they make no secret of pining for a whiter, more Christian America. Trump has found many ways to communicate this: for example, by making clear his disdain for “shithole” countries and his preference for white Christian immigrants; by pointedly accepting white South Africans as political refugees (while closing the door to most other asylum seekers); by renaming military bases to share the names of Confederate generals (after Congress ordered their names removed); by saying that civil-rights laws led to whites’ being “very badly treated.” In his National Security Strategy, he castigates Europe for allowing immigration to undermine “civilizational self-confidence” and proclaims, “We want Europe to remain European,” a rallying cry of white Christian nationalists across the continent. Taking his cue, the Department of Homeland Security has propagated unashamedly white-nationalist themes, and national parks and museums have scrubbed their exhibits of references to slavery.

Mobs and street thugs. The use of militias and mobs to harass, rough up, and otherwise intimidate opponents is a standard fascist stratagem (the textbook example being Hitler’s Kristallnacht pogrom in 1938). As few will need reminding, the Trump-MAGA parallel is the mob and militia violence against the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Trump knowingly laid groundwork for this operation, calling on militia forces to “stand back and stand by” in September 2020 and later dog-whistling “Be there, will be wild!” to his supporters. His pardon of all of the Capitol attackers—more than 1,500, including the most violent—only proved what we knew, which is that they had his blessing. While Trump has found state violence adequate to his purposes so far in his second term, street violence is self-evidently in his repertoire.

Leader aggrandizement. Since 2016, when he declared that “I alone can fix it” and bragged that his supporters would remain loyal if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue, Trump has cultivated a personality cult. Although some of his efforts at self-aggrandizement can seem comical (the gilding of the Oval Office, the renaming of the Kennedy Center, the proposed triumphal arch), he understands the centrality of leader worship in a fascist-style regime. In sharp contradistinction to the American presidential tradition since George Washington, he makes no pretense of serving the people or the Constitution. His mindset, his symbolism, and his rhetoric all underscore the point he made to The New York Times this month: His own mind and morality are the only limits on his global power. This is Fascism 101.

Alternative facts. As Orwell, Hannah Arendt, and practically every other scholar of authoritarianism have emphasized, creating a reality-distortion field is the first thing a fascistic government will do, the better to drive its own twisted narrative, confuse the citizenry, demoralize political opponents, and justify every manner of corruption and abuse. While other presidents (including some good ones) have lied, none have come close to Trump’s deployment of Russian-style mass disinformation, as I detail in my book The Constitution of Knowledge. From the start of his first term, Trump has made “alternative facts” a hallmark of his governing style, issuing lies, exaggerations, and half-truths at a rate of 20 a day. Predictably, his second term has brought more of the same. Following his lead, a MAGA-fied postmodern right gleefully trashes objectivity as elitism and truth as a mask for power.

Politics as war. A distinctive mark of fascism is its conception of politics, best captured by Carl Schmitt, an early-20th-century German political theorist whose doctrines legitimized Nazism. Schmitt rejected the Madisonian view of politics as a social negotiation in which different factions, interests, and ideology come to agreement, the core idea of our Constitution. Rather, he saw politics as a state of war between enemies, neither of which can understand the other and both of which feel existentially threatened—and only one of which can win. The aim of Schmittian politics is not to share the country but to dominate or destroy the other side. This conception has been evident in MAGA politics since Michael Anton (now a Trump-administration official) published his famous article arguing that the 2016 election was a life-and-death battle to save the country from the left (a “Flight 93” election: “charge the cockpit or you die”). In the speech given by Stephen Miller at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service, MAGA’s embrace of Schmittian totalism found its apotheosis: “We are the storm. And our enemies cannot comprehend our strength, our determination, our resolve, our passion … You are nothing. You are wickedness.”

Governing as revolution. Although born in revolution, the American liberal tradition, especially its conservative branch, prizes continuity, stability, and incremental change guided by reason. Fascism, by contrast, “is not reactionary but revolutionary,” as Mussolini insisted. It seeks to uproot and replace the old order and embraces bold, exhilarating action unshackled to rational deliberation. MAGA embraces its own revolutionary ethos, what Russell Vought, the administration’s Office of Management and Budget director and probably its most formidable intellect, has called “radical constitutionalism,” a doctrine that would vitiate many checks on presidential power. In pursuit of this vision, Vought told Tucker Carlson in a November 2024 interview, “The president has to move executively as fast and as aggressively as possible, with a radical constitutional perspective, to be able to dismantle that [federal] bureaucracy and their power centers” because “the bureaucracies hate the American people.” He predicted, “If you have a radical constitutionalism, it’s going to be destabilizing … But it’s also exhilarating.” He said he would put federal agencies “in trauma,” an idea echoed by Christopher Rufo, an architect of Trump’s attack on universities, which Rufo described as a “counterrevolution blueprint” to put universities “in an existential terror.” As Trump shuttered a congressionally mandated agency, renamed an international body of water, arrested an op-ed writer, deported immigrants to a foreign gulag, terrorized American cities, threatened an ally, and more, he showed how it looks when a radicalized state abandons rational deliberation and goes to war against itself.

One can object that there are elements of classical European fascism that are not found in Trumpism (mass rallies and public rituals, for example)—or that there are additional elements of Trumpism that belong on the list (MAGA’s hypermasculinity, misogyny, and co-option of Christianity all resemble fascist patterns). The exercise of comparing fascism’s various forms is not precise. If historians object that Trump is not a copy of Mussolini or Hitler or Franco, the reply is yes—but so what? Trump is building something new on old principles. He is showing us in real time what 21st-century American fascism looks like.

If, however, Trump is a fascist president, that does not mean that America is a fascist country. The courts, the states, and the media remain independent of him, and his efforts to browbeat them will likely fail. He may lose his grip on Congress in November. He has not succeeded in molding public opinion, except against himself. He has outrun the mandate of his voters, his coalition is fracturing, and he has neglected tools that allow presidents to make enduring change. He and his party may defy the Constitution, but they cannot rewrite it, thank goodness.

So the United States, once the world’s exemplary liberal democracy, is now a hybrid state combining a fascist leader and a liberal Constitution; but no, it has not fallen to fascism. And it will not.

In which case, is there any point in calling Trump a fascist, even if true? Doesn’t that alienate his voters? Wouldn’t it be better just to describe his actions without labeling him controversially?

Until recently, I thought so. No longer. The resemblances are too many and too strong to deny. Americans who support liberal democracy need to recognize what we’re dealing with in order to cope with it, and to recognize something, one must name it. Trump has revealed himself, and we must name what we see.

        This article was updated on January 29, 2026, at 7:15pm ET.

The six-car ICE convoy came to a stop and instantly dozens of people swarmed it, cellphones in hand, while others ran out of nearby houses—I saw a woman in gym shorts in the 20-degree weather—and began surrounding the masked and heavily armed agents who had spilled out of their black SUVs. The fury in the crowd felt almost like a physical force, as real as the cacophony of whistles and honking cars and angry chants: “ICE out! Fuck you! Go home!”

The officers threw a protester to the slushy asphalt and piled on top of them, then cuffed them and dragged them away. The screaming only got louder. With their escape route blocked by protesters and their cars, the agents tossed out tear-gas canisters, the white clouds billowing up into the winter air. An injured man stumbled past me and vomited repeatedly into the snow.

From where I stood, a few yards back from the scrum last Wednesday afternoon, it looked, at best, to be a savage caricature of our national divide: On one side, militarized men demanded respect at the butt of a gun; on the other, angry protesters screamed for justice.

But behind the violence in Minneapolis—captured in so many chilling photographs in recent weeks—is a different reality: a meticulous urban choreography of civic protest. You could see traces of it in the identical whistles the protesters used, in their chants, in their tactics, in the way they followed ICE agents but never actually blocked them from detaining people. Thousands of Minnesotans have been trained over the past year as legal observers and have taken part in lengthy role-playing exercises where they rehearse scenes exactly like the one I witnessed. They patrol neighborhoods day and night on foot and stay connected on encrypted apps such as Signal, in networks that were first formed after the 2020 killing of George Floyd.

Again and again, I heard people say they were not protesters but protectors—of their communities, of their values, of the Constitution. Vice President Vance has decried the protests as “engineered chaos” produced by far-left activists working in tandem with local authorities. But the reality on the ground is both stranger and more interesting. The movement has grown much larger than the core of activists shown on TV newscasts, especially since the killing of Renee Good on January 7. And it lacks the sort of central direction that Vance and other administration officials seem to imagine.

At times, Minneapolis reminded me of what I saw during the Arab Spring in 2011, a series of street clashes between protesters and police that quickly swelled into a much larger struggle against autocracy. As in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, Minneapolis has seen a layered civic uprising where a vanguard of protesters has gained strength as many others who don’t share progressive convictions joined in feeling, if not always in person. I heard the same tones of outrage from parents, ministers, schoolteachers, and elderly residents of an affluent suburb. Some of the quarrels that divided Minneapolis city leaders only a few weeks ago, over policing or Gaza or the budget, have faded as people have come together to oppose ICE.

“Overall, this community has exercised enormous restraint,” Allison Sharkey, the executive director of the Lake Street Council, which represents many minority-owned businesses that have been hit hard by the ICE raids, told me. “But we have been pushed, probably intentionally, towards civil unrest.”

And as with the Arab uprisings, there is profound unease about where it is all leading—especially now that two people have been shot dead in scenes like the one I witnessed—alongside an undertow of hope that Minnesota can provide the rest of the country with a model of democratic resistance.

Over the past year, a three-story brick building in south Minneapolis has become a magnet for people who feel they—and their neighbors—need protection from their own government. The nonprofit that runs training sessions there asked me not to identify its location. When I visited, an ebullient labor organizer named Emilia Gonzalez Avalos was standing onstage in front of a packed auditorium, talking about the facial-recognition technology used by ICE agents, who routinely photograph protesters. “Everyone is at risk now,” she said. Behind her, a screen offered bullet points on how to legally observe ICE raids.

Avalos told me that 65,000 people have received the training, most of them since December. “We started in a very different tone; it was preventive,” she said. Now, after Good’s death, “people are understanding the stakes in a different way.”

I went upstairs to see breakout sessions where people were being trained by a different organization for direct confrontations with ICE. Inside a classroom, several dozen people ranging in age from 14 to about 70 faced off against three trainers playing ICE agents, in a loud fracas that lasted several minutes. Afterward, the trainers offered the volunteers a critique. One gray-haired lady said she had found the exercise difficult, “not being a ‘Fuck you’ person.” Others got tips on how to brace themselves more effectively so that the agents could not easily knock them down.

Before I left, I watched the trainers put the group through two more simulations: an unexpected ICE raid on a neighbor’s home and a planned demonstration at an airport that ICE is using to deport people. The second scenario appeared to come to life a few days later, when about 100 clergy members were arrested for protesting at the Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport.

The participants I spoke with did not seem like typical protest types. One of them, a driver’s-ed teacher who asked me to identify him only as Dave, told me, “I do not like confrontation at all, and that’s another reason that it’s weird I went to the training.” But in light of what is happening around him, he felt he needed what the trainers had to offer. His 14-year-old daughter, who attended the training with him, told me, “It was kind of overwhelming. But I don’t think it could be too much, because they’re just being realistic.”

The nonprofit groups that run these training sessions are not organizing or directing the anti-ICE protests taking place in the Twin Cities. No one is. This is a leaderless movement—like the Arab Spring protests—that has emerged in a spontaneous and hyperlocal way. The people who follow ICE convoys (they call themselves “commuters,” a verbal gesture that is part joke and part effort to elude government surveillance) have organized on a neighborhood basis, using Signal groups. The man who drove me to the ICE raids I witnessed—a lawyer, activist, and social-media figure named Will Stancil—had a cellphone fixed above the windshield of his car, and I could hear people tracking the location of the ICE convoy as it passed through their neighborhoods on a Signal audio chat. It was like being inside a police car that is getting updates by radio from a dispatcher.

You do not have to get tear-gassed to observe all of this self-organization; it is visible to anyone walking through Minneapolis. One bitterly cold morning, I approached a man standing across the street from an elementary school, a blue whistle around his neck. He told me his name was Daniel (he asked not to be identified further, because his wife is an immigrant) and that he stood watch every morning for an hour to make sure the kids got into school safely. Other local volunteers come by regularly to bring him coffee and baked goods, or to exchange news. These community watches take place outside schools throughout the Twin Cities, outside restaurants and day-care centers, outside any place where there are immigrants or people who might be mistaken for them.

“It’s kind of unorganized-organized,” Daniel said, when I asked how the school monitoring worked. “George Floyd connected everybody.”

The local networks that formed after Floyd’s killing were not just about fighting racism. During those febrile weeks in May and June of 2020, there were looters and provocateurs of all kinds on the streets, and so much anger had been directed at the police that they pulled back from parts of the city. Many neighborhoods began organizing local watches simply to defend themselves.

I had been talking with Daniel for only a few minutes when a tall man walked up, said he was a parent observer for the school we stood across from, and asked me to identify myself. When I showed him my press badge, he seemed friendlier, but still wary. He explained that he had heard reports of ICE agents impersonating journalists. I asked about the parent patrol, and he apologized, saying he couldn’t give out any information.

Inside the schools, many administrators have been making their own preparations over the past year. Amanda Bauer, a teacher at a Minneapolis elementary school that has a large portion of immigrant students, told me that administrators informed parents last fall about their emergency plans for ICE raids by phone or in person, because they were already concerned about leaving email chains that could be mined by a hostile government.

Bauer, who is 49, struggled to maintain her composure as she described the day early this month when ICE showed up in force outside her school. Agents had been circling the school since December, seemingly learning its routines, and they arrested some parents just before the winter break. But this time, agents leaped out in riot gear and began entering the apartments just across from the school, where many students live.

“We had to lock down and keep the kids inside, and parents linked arms to block the school entrance,” Bauer said. “We had a student who was looking out the window and saw them break into his apartment and just sobbed, ‘That’s my house. That’s my home.’ And we shut the blinds, but it was too late.”

Bauer has been a teacher for 25 years, a period that has included a rise of school shootings and the drills that have become common to protect against them. “But I never thought it would be our own government we had to protect the kids from,” she told me. “We kept them physically safe, but they saw what happened.”

As she spoke, Bauer’s hands were trembling. She held them up and smiled weakly. “I don’t think I’ve stopped shaking for two weeks,” she said.

Children were a moral fault line for many of the people I met in the Twin Cities—not just the children of immigrants, who are at risk of losing their parents or being deported themselves, but also their white peers in schools and day-care centers.

I met a couple in their 70s who told me they had never considered joining a political protest until ICE came to town, and they realized that their granddaughter was at risk of witnessing a violent immigration raid just by going to school. Dan and Jane (like many others, they asked that I shield their full names) live in a large house in a comfortable suburb, where they welcomed me with tea and cookies.

“When a child witnesses violence or crime, it’s profoundly different from adults,” Dan said. “It leaves scars.”

Dan and Jane resisted the idea that they had become political. A better word, Jane said, was humanist. Their anger was unmistakable as they told me that the Trump administration was violating basic Christian principles. “It became clear very quickly that ICE is the Proud Boys, the Boogaloo boys. They’ve given them uniforms and let them run wild,” Dan said. He attended a legal-observer training—which happened to have been on the day Good was killed—and now the couple delivers groceries regularly to immigrant families in Minneapolis. This past Friday, Dan joined thousands of others at a protest in Minneapolis, where his fingers were frostbitten in the –9 degrees Fahrenheit weather.

I arrived in Minneapolis 11 days after an ICE agent shot Good in the face. Her picture was hanging like a religious icon on windows and walls all over the city. To many who had not already become involved, her death was a call to action.

One of those latecomers was a 46-year-old documentary filmmaker named Chad Knutson. On the morning after Good was killed, he was at home with his two hound dogs, watching a live feed from the Whipple Building, where ICE is based, a five-minute drive from his house. A protester had laid a rose on a makeshift memorial to Good. As Knutson watched, an ICE agent took the rose, put it in his lapel, and then mockingly gave it to a female ICE agent. They both laughed.

Knutson told me he had never been a protester. It seemed pointless, or just a way for people to expiate their sense of guilt. But when he saw those ICE agents laughing, something broke inside him.

“I grab my keys, I grab a coat, and drive over,” Knutson told me. “I barely park my car and I’m running out screaming and crying, ‘You stole a fucking flower from a dead woman. Like, are any of you human anymore?’”

His voice was so thick with emotion that it felt almost as if he were telling a story of religious conversion. It reminded me again of the Tahrir Square protests in 2011, when so many people seemed to have reached a moral and political turning point.

Knutson now goes to the Whipple Building almost daily, bringing thermoses of hot coffee for the people who hold up signs and bellow at the ICE agents and convoys as they drive in and out. He has been tear-gassed so many times, he said, his voice has gone hoarse. When I met him at his house in St. Paul, a row of megaphones was on the counter. He hands them out along with the coffee. He once brought an ice-fishing clam, a portable shelter, to the Whipple to help the protesters withstand the subzero temperatures.

Knutson mentioned in passing that his neighbor had “an adopted brown kid down there; they hid her in the basement yesterday.” This kind of thing no longer sounds weird in Minneapolis. Many people are hiding indoors—so many that, in a city with a substantial minority population, I hardly saw any Black or Latino faces on the street.

All this sheltering has created an economic crisis that has grown worse by the day. Many immigrant-owned businesses have seen their sales drop by as much as 80 percent, said Allison Sharkey, of the Lake Street Council. Large numbers have shut their doors entirely, fearing for themselves or their employees. Sharkey called it “an assault on our entire Main Street.”

The Karmel Mall, a maze-like shopping hub for tens of thousands of East African immigrants in the Twin Cities, is usually packed with people drawn to the aromas of stewed goat and coffee and sambusa pastries, but when I visited, the place was silent, and most of the stalls were empty. At the far end I found some businesses still open, with a handful of customers. Several people looked frightened when I tried to ask questions, saying they didn’t speak English well or that the owner would be back in an hour.

One man willing to chat, a 42-year-old named Ziad who was sipping coffee by himself, quickly showed me his passport card, saying he had come to the United States from Somalia decades ago. He has a master’s degree in public health and was working in a community center, he said, but now it’s closed. “Nobody’s being paid,” he said. “Everybody is scared.” His children are attending school online, as they did during the coronavirus pandemic, and his wife almost never leaves home. The visits to the mosque and to family members and friends that sustained their emotional lives are on hold.

But Donald Trump “will go and we will stay,” he said. “We Somalis know how to survive. We’ve been through a lot—civil war, refugee camps.”

The Somali refugees who began coming to the Twin Cities in the early 1990s did so with the help of religious organizations and churches, especially Lutheran and Catholic parishes, that have a history of welcoming people fleeing war and famine. Those groups have been at the forefront of the resistance to ICE, and some of their leaders have been asking difficult questions: When does protest cross the line into violence? When is it morally acceptable to break the law? How do you retain the trust of people who are uncomfortable defying the authorities?

“We’re going to have to live with our discomfort in making other people uncomfortable,” Ingrid Rasmussen, the lead pastor at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, who has been one of the most outspoken clergy members in the city, told me.

Last June, federal agents raided a taqueria near her church. She ran to the scene, she told me, and found a crowd of protesters facing off against heavily armed agents being protected by local police. Rasmussen was wearing her clerical robes and was thrown to the ground by a sheriff in plainclothes. Some in the crowd threw trash, bottles, and tires at the federal agents, according to a local news report. Video footage spread of Rasmussen shouting at the Minneapolis police chief: “You stand in my church … You promised me a better relationship.”

“It was like nothing I had ever seen before in Minneapolis,” Rasmussen told me.

That was a remarkable thing to hear, because Rasmussen’s church was near the center of the riots that took place after the killing of George Floyd in 2020. “Everything to the west of our building burned,” she told me. During that period, her church became a medical site for injured people. She and her congregation worked for years to help rebuild the neighborhood.

The new round of ICE raids has struck even closer to home for the church, whose congregation includes a large number of immigrants. Rasmussen, who has young children, has continued to put herself in harm’s way. She was among the 120 clergy members who took part in a sit-in at the corporate headquarters of Target on January 15, in an effort to get the company to take a stronger stand against the federal raids. And on January 23, she was among those arrested during the protest at the Minneapolis airport.

On the morning of January 24, Rasmussen got word that a man had been shot by ICE agents. She put on her warmest winter clothes and went to the scene, on Nicollet Avenue and West 26th Street, figuring she might be outside for hours.

By the time she got there, Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse, was dead. The federal agents who had wrestled him to the ground and then shot and killed him were throwing tear gas and flash-bangs at a crowd of furious protesters chanting “Shame!”

Rasmussen attended another protest that afternoon. When we spoke hours later, her voice sounded weary, as if she wasn’t sure what such gestures of defiance would accomplish. She found it “almost unbearable” to witness such brutality from her government day after day, she told me. And it was galling to hear people in power say that they were acting in defense of freedom. The streets still looked like a war zone, with flash-bangs detonating and clouds of tear gas in the air.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Gregory Bovino has been removed from his high-profile role as Border Patrol 'commander at large' and reassigned to California following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis. His demotion suggests a shift in the Trump administration's immigration tactics, as Border Czar Tom Homan takes command in Minnesota and questions arise regarding the job security of DHS Secretary Kristi Noem.

        Sign up for Inside the Trump Presidency, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump term.

Gregory Bovino has been removed from his role as Border Patrol “commander at large” and will return to his former job in El Centro, California, where he is expected to retire soon, according to a DHS official and two people with knowledge of the change.

Bovino’s sudden demotion is the clearest sign yet that the Trump administration is reconsidering its most aggressive tactics after the killing Saturday of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents under Bovino’s command.

Earlier today, President Trump appeared to signal in a series of social-media posts a tactical shift in the administration’s mass-deportation campaign. Trump wrote that he spoke with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz—whom the White House has blamed for inciting violence—and the two men are now on “a similar wavelength.” Tom Homan, the former ICE chief whom Trump has designated “border czar,” will head to Minnesota to assume command of the federal mobilization there, Trump said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and her close adviser Corey Lewandowski, who were Bovino’s biggest backers at DHS, are also at risk of losing their jobs, two of the people told me.

For the past seven months, Bovino has been the public face of a traveling immigration crackdown on cities governed by Democrats. Noem and other Trump officials gave Bovino the “commander” title and sent him and his masked border agents to Chicago, Charlotte, New Orleans, and then Minneapolis. Bovino became a MAGA social-media star as he traveled the country with his own film crew and used social media to hit back at Democratic politicians and random critics online. Veteran ICE and CBP officials grew more and more uneasy as Bovino worked outside his agency’s chain of command and appeared to relish his role as a political actor.

In Minneapolis, the Trump administration used Bovino as its lead spokesperson, scheduling daily press conferences where he defended agents’ rough tactics and cast blame on protesters and local officials. Border Patrol commanders typically avoid engaging in political arguments with elected officials.

Bovino’s fall comes two days after Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis fatally shot Pretti, an intensive-care nurse who worked with veterans. Hours after the shooting, Bovino appeared at a press conference and echoed statements by the Department of Homeland Security alleging Pretti sought to “massacre” the federal agents. Bovino repeatedly claimed that Border Patrol agents, not Pretti, were the victims.

Videos of the encounter showed no evidence for his claims. Pretti, who was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, did not draw a firearm or attack the agents. The videos show one agent disarming Pretti in the moments just before another agent shot him in the back.

DHS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials did not immediately respond to questions about Bovino’s departure from Minnesota and his current role. Asked about Bovino and Noem, a White House spokesperson referred to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s statement today that Noem has the president’s “utmost confidence and trust.”

In another post, Trump said he also spoke with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. “Lots of progress is being made!” the president wrote. “Tom Homan will be meeting with him tomorrow in order to continue the discussion.”

        <hr/>
        Of the many lessons to be drawn from the administration’s retreat in Minneapolis, the most important is that Donald Trump can be stopped.

He spent his first year acting as though the 2024 election were the last time he would ever have to give a thought to public opinion. Now the myth that Trump is invincible has been exploded.

After federal agents killed Alex Pretti, Trump-administration figures including Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller described the victim as a terrorist, indicating their desire to ignore or intimidate all opposition. But other Republican sources signaled their discomfort, and some called for an investigation—a routine step for a normal presidency, but a daring breach of partisan discipline in an administration that shields itself from accountability and tries to put itself above the law.

During yesterday’s White House briefing, when a reporter asked if Trump shared Miller’s belief that Pretti was a domestic terrorist, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt replied that she hadn’t heard him use that term. Trump also sent out conciliatory messages on social media indicating that he’d had productive talks with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. And he dispatched Tom Homan, the border czar and a more traditional immigration hawk, to replace Gregory Bovino, the commander at large in Minnesota. Bovino has justified his agents’ misconduct with transparent lies.

Trump’s retreat in Minneapolis is a stinging defeat for the national conservatives, the Republican Party’s most nakedly authoritarian faction. The NatCons believe American liberalism cannot be dealt with through normal political methods such as persuasion and compromise. Speakers at the National Conservatism Conference have described the American left as “the enemy within” (Senator Rick Scott of Florida) and “wokeism” as “a cancer that must be eradicated” (Rachel Bovard of the Conservative Partnership Institute). NatCons also maintain that immigration poses a mortal threat to the United States. These two strands of thought are intertwined; NatCons consider immigration a weapon employed consciously by the left to assume permanent power, via manipulating elections and creating government dependency, a conspiracy that can only be reversed through the kind of ferocious operation on display in Minneapolis.

The NatCons, whose ranks include powerful administration figures such as Vice President Vance and Miller as well as members of Congress (such as Senator Eric Schmitt of Missouri) and activists (such as Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts), have wielded profound influence. They have rarely, if ever, lost important struggles to steer Trump’s strategy.

For the NatCons, the mass-deportation scheme overseen by Miller is an existential priority. Vance once claimed that immigration levels “would mean we never win, meaning Republicans would never win a national election in this country ever again.” Ten days ago, Miller explained on Fox News that Democrats were resisting ICE in Minneapolis because “this mass-migration scheme is the heart of the Democratic Party’s political power.” Miller sees his crusade not merely as a matter of relieving the burden on public services or raising wages, but as a final chance to stop permanent left-wing tyranny. Thus Miller’s immediate, fervent insistence that Pretti and the other Minnesotan recently killed by federal agents, Renee Good, both deserved their fates, a line the NatCons repeated vociferously through Monday.

The NatCons have attained their sway by positioning themselves as the vanguard of Trumpism in its purist form. Other conservative factions, such as social conservatives, libertarians, and foreign-policy hawks, supported Trump reluctantly in 2016, and backed away after the January 6 attack on the Capitol, hoping Florida Governor Ron DeSantis or some other rival could displace him. The NatCons never flinched in the face of Trump’s failed autogolpe, or any other actions that made other Republicans nervous. They won the loyalty contest—which, in the second Trump administration, is the only currency of influence.

Calls for Trump to stand firmly behind Miller had a desperate yet vague tone. “Leftist protestors who shut down streets, destroy property, refuse lawful orders, and physically assault federal officers cannot be rewarded with veto power over public policy,” beseeched the Manhattan Institute activist Chris Rufo, employing the passive voice. In response to a liberal observing yesterday afternoon on X that Trump was backing down, Will Chamberlain, a national conservative affiliated with numerous right-wing organizations, replied, “This isn’t happening, and it’s very important that it does not happen.”

Nevertheless, it was happening.

The reason it happened is that, although Trump listens to the NatCons, he has no deep grounding in their theories or, for that matter, any theories. The president’s despotism is not ideological but instinctive. He cannot tolerate criticism and he deems any process that embarrasses him, including a critical news story or an election, illegitimate, even criminal.

And while he has embraced a restrictionist immigration agenda, he has vacillated between endorsing mass deportation and allowing exceptions for categories of laborers he considers necessary. As Trump told The Wall Street Journal editorial page before the 2024 election, “I mean, there’s some human questions that get in the way of being perfect, and we have to have the heart, too.” If that has ever occurred to Miller, he has hidden it well.

Whether or not Trump’s intermittent expressions of human feeling for the immigrants his administration has abused is heartfelt, his desire to maintain his political standing most certainly is. Trump appreciates the power of imagery. It does not take a political genius to understand that, if Americans were repulsed by the sight of a Vietnamese man being executed in 1968, an American being shot in the back, facedown on a midwestern street, would not go over much better.

Trump’s capitulation would never have occurred if not for the heroic, disciplined resistance in Minneapolis. Faced with something like an occupying army that was systematically flouting the law, the people of Minneapolis thrust its abuse into the public eye, raising the political cost of Miller’s war until enough Republicans decided that they couldn’t bear to pay it.

Political theorists have long debated whether Trump and his movement should be described as fascist. On an intellectual level, the answer depends largely on which definition of fascism you choose (there are several). I have generally resisted the term because the definition I prefer, and the one most Americans probably think of when they hear the term, is not mere political oppression but a form of it so extreme that opposition becomes impossible.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> This investigative report details the harrowing 70-mile migration route through the Darién Gap, a treacherous jungle connecting Colombia and Panama. As hundreds of thousands risk death and disease to reach the United States, the passage is increasingly managed by the Gulf Clan cartel, illustrating how tightened border policies have shifted control to criminal organizations and exacerbated the humanitarian crisis.

They gathered in the predawn dark. Bleary-eyed children squirmed. Adults lugging babies and backpacks stood at attention as someone working under the command of Colombia’s most powerful drug cartel, the Gulf Clan, shouted instructions into a megaphone, temporarily drowning out the cacophony of the jungle’s birds and insects: Make sure everyone has enough to eat and drink, especially the children. Blue or green fabric tied to trees means keep walking. Red means you’re going the wrong way and should turn around.

Next came prayers for the group’s safety and survival: “Lord, take care of every step that we take.” When the sun peeked above the horizon, they were off.

More than 600 people were in the crowd that plunged into the jungle that morning, beginning a roughly 70-mile journey from northern Colombia into southern Panama. That made it a slow day by local standards. They came from Haiti, Ethiopia, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela, headed north across the only strip of land that connects South America to Central America.

The Darién Gap was thought for centuries to be all but impassable. Explorers and would-be colonizers who entered tended to die of hunger or thirst, be attacked by animals, drown in fast-rising rivers, or simply get lost and never emerge. Those dangers remain, but in recent years the jungle has become a superhighway for people hoping to reach the United States. According to the United Nations, more than 800,000 may cross the Darién Gap this year—a more than 50 percent increase over last year’s previously unimaginable number. Children under 5 are the fastest-growing group.

The U.S. has spent years trying to discourage this migration, pressuring its Latin American neighbors to close off established routes and deny visas to foreigners trying to fly into countries close to the U.S. border. Instead of stopping migrants from coming, this approach has simply rerouted them through the jungle, and shifted the management of their passage onto criminal organizations, which have eagerly taken advantage. The Gulf Clan, which now calls itself Ejército Gaitanista de Colombia, effectively controls this part of northern Colombia. It has long moved drugs and weapons through the Darién Gap; now it moves people too.

Everyone who works in the Darién Gap must be approved by the cartel and hand over a portion of their earnings. They have built stairs into hillsides and outfitted cliffs with ladders and camps with Wi‑Fi. They advertise it all on TikTok and YouTube, and anyone can book a journey online. There are many paths through. The most grueling route is the cheapest—right now, about $300 a person to cross the jungle on foot. Taking a boat up the coast can cost more than $1,000.

I went to the Darién Gap in December with the photographer Lynsey Addario because I wanted to see for myself what people were willing to risk to get to the United States. Before making the journey, I spoke with a handful of journalists who had done so before. They had dealt with typhoid, rashes, emergency evacuations, and mysterious illnesses that lingered for months. One was tied up in the forest and robbed at gunpoint. They said that we could take measures to make the journey safer but that ultimately, survival required luck.

Each year, Panamanian authorities remove dozens of bodies from the jungle. Far more are swallowed up by nature. These deaths are the result not only of extreme conditions, but also of the flawed logic embraced by the U.S. and other wealthy nations: that by making migration harder, we can limit the number of people who attempt it. This hasn’t happened—not in the Mediterranean, or the Rio Grande, or the Darién Gap. Instead, more people come every year. What I saw in the jungle confirmed the pattern that has played out elsewhere: The harder migration is, the more cartels and other dangerous groups will profit, and the more migrants will die.

The night before we set out, a Venezuelan father named Bergkan Rhuly Ale Vidal paced around a camp at the jungle’s mouth, packing and repacking his family’s bags. He and his partner, Orlimar, had their children with them: 2-year-old Isaac and 8-year-old Camila. Even in the dark the air was sweltering, and Bergkan’s mind was spinning with worry. What if one of the children fell and hurt themselves, or came down with a fever? What if one was bitten by a snake? In trying to salvage his family’s future, had he gravely miscalculated?

The first day, the path was studded with boulders and trip-wired with vines. It weaved across a river so many times that I quickly gave up on dumping out my rubber boots, because they would only fill again minutes later. Bergkan’s family’s tennis shoes were already ripped and disintegrating. The hills were slick with mud and so steep that we were often not so much walking as climbing on our hands and knees, holding on to mangled roots.

We passed stands selling bottles of water and Gatorade, two for $5. Porters, known as mochileros, circled the family, hawking their services. “We carry backpacks, we carry children!” they chanted. They charge roughly $100 a day, and also barter with migrants for items in their backpacks. Orlimar tried trading a pair of old headphones for new boots, but was rejected. A couple of times, she and Bergkan lost patience with the porters and yelled, “We have no money!”

Midmorning, we reached the route’s toughest hill. After half an hour of climbing, Bergkan crashed to the ground, his chest heaving. Orlimar threw down her belongings. “What do you have in that bag?” he asked her.

“Shoes—sandals,” Orlimar said in a voice so soft, she was barely audible.

Bergkan told her to dump any weight she could. She began pulling out clean clothes. “Someone else will be able to use them,” he said. But the other families nearby were also unloading supplies. The people who had the strength to keep hiking charged past us, staring straight ahead, as if exhaustion were an illness that they might catch just by looking at it.

Crossing the jungle can take three days or 10, depending on the weather, the weight of your bags, and pure chance. A minor injury can be catastrophic for even the fittest people. Smugglers often downplay how many days the journey will take—Bergkan had been told to plan for two. A few hours into the trip, he began to realize that they were nowhere near as deep into the jungle as they needed to be, which meant they might not have enough food to get them out.

Bergkan and Orlimar had planned for a different life. They’d met as teenagers and gone to college together, Orlimar studying nursing and Bergkan engineering. But Venezuela’s economy imploded in 2014, the result of corruption and mismanagement. Then an authoritarian crackdown by the leftist president, Nicolás Maduro, led to punishing American sanctions. The future they had been working toward ceased to exist. In the past decade, at least 7.7 million Venezuelans have fled.

Bergkan and Orlimar spent five years taking any job they could get, first in Venezuela and then in Peru, while they watched their friends and classmates leave, one after another, for the United States. Then Orlimar’s cousin Elimar, who was like a sister to her, came to them with an offer: Her boyfriend, who was living in Dallas, would pay for Bergkan’s family to take the cheapest route across the jungle, if Elimar and her two children—who were 6 and 8—could go with them. “No one in Venezuela can lend you money, much less that amount,” Bergkan told me. “It was our moment.” They planned to stay in the U.S. only until Venezuela’s economy recovered and they could return home.

We trudged uphill for hours. Isaac teetered on Bergkan’s shoulders. Gripping his son’s feet, Bergkan adopted a strategy of sprinting up a stretch of hill for about 30 seconds, then collapsing again. His limbs shook and his face turned an ominous shade of purple. “The weight you carry is in your mind,” he said at one point, giving himself a pep talk. Camila stopped cold a couple of times, holding up the long line of people behind her, and yelled, “Mommy, I can’t!”

Around 1 p.m., Isaac fell asleep, his limp body rocking back and forth. “It feels like his weight has tripled,” Bergkan told Orlimar. They sat down on a hillside to regroup. Elimar tried coaxing her nephew awake with lollipops, but he was unresponsive. Other parents stopped to ask if he was okay. Bergkan pulled a packet of electrolyte powder out of his bag. He mixed it with water, then shook Isaac awake and told all four children to down it. “We’re going to get you out of here,” Bergkan said, more to himself than to anyone else.

Eventually, a porter explained that we were moving too slowly to make it to Panama that day; we would have to sleep at a camp for stragglers. When we arrived, we saw wooden platforms for tents, bucket showers and toilets, and a couple of outdoor kitchens with Colombians serving plates of chicken and rice—all for a price. People around us began purchasing Wi‑Fi for $2 an hour so they could ask relatives to send them more money; transfers carried a 20 percent fee. Elimar began circulating through the camp, asking other Venezuelans for a loan to help her contact her boyfriend. Bergkan, Orlimar, and their children sat down and rubbed their aching limbs. They had no one to call.

In the three trips I took to the Darién Gap over the course of five months, I saw new bridges and paved roads appear deeper in the jungle, Wi‑Fi hotspots extend their reach, and landmarks that were previously known only by word of mouth appear on Google Maps. Looking down at a thrashing river, I held on to ropes that made it safer—slightly—to creep across sheer rock faces behind parents with crying babies strapped to their chests.

Guides and porters follow the migrants in the jungle with their iPhones rolling, asking, “Do you feel good?” and “Have we treated you well?” They film incessantly during the first day of walking, when people are still able to conjure a smile. (Even I ended up in one of their videos.) They post the videos on social media, selling trips across the jungle as if they were joyful nature walks. The profit motives of the cartel have become yet another factor fueling migration.

The UN has tried to counteract these messages by stationing migration officials at bus stations and other checkpoints along the way to the Darién Gap; they warn people of the dangers ahead and try to persuade them to reconsider. Those efforts have been largely ineffective. “People come with tunnel vision, like, ‘I must get to the United States,’ ” Cristian Camilo Moreno García, a UN migration official based in northern Colombia, told me. “Turning back is not an option.”

On the second morning of our journey, about 150 people filed out of the camp and waited for the sun to rise before they started walking. Bergkan and his family ate nothing; they needed to conserve the few cans of tuna and packages of cookies they had left. The children were still in their pajamas, some of their only remaining clean clothes. Two women stood at the end of the line collecting final payments and then handing each person a wristband, the kind you might get at a music festival, to show that they had paid. “Please take out your money so that we can move you along faster!” one yelled.

We walked along a narrow ridge with steep cliffs dropping off on either side, all of us trudging much slower than the day before. After about an hour and a half, Elimar’s son, Luciano, crumpled to the ground. The adults gathered around him. “Take off his sweater—he’s suffocating!” one yelled. Without a word, one of the porters Lynsey and I had hired hoisted the child onto his shoulders, apparently unable to watch Luciano struggle any longer. He dashed up the slope and out of sight. Elimar looked defeated but also relieved to have one fewer child to worry about, at least until we made it to the next stopping point.

Word spread down the line that we were approaching the border with Panama. The porters, who had boisterously peddled their services for two days, started to go quiet. Profiting from migration is illegal in Panama, and can carry a sentence of more than 12 years in prison. Panama’s border patrol, known as SENAFRONT, has been enforcing those laws aggressively against people who sell migrants bottles of water, carry their backpacks, or serve as guides. The porter who had picked up Luciano revealed the scar on his chest from a bullet wound that he said he’d sustained on a previous trek, when officers had sprayed bullets into Colombia. He said that we should be prepared to run. (When I asked Jorge Gobea, the head of the agency, if his officers ever shot across the border at Colombian guides, he told me, “If someone armed fights Panama authorities, we use force.”)

The border was marked by a Panamanian flag and piles of trash. Some people posed for pictures and celebrated half-heartedly, unsure if they were nearing the end of the journey or still at the beginning. Orlimar made the sign of the cross, then sat down with her head between her knees. Elimar was the first to notice the Panamanian border guards approaching and warned us: “Get down! Get down!”

Lynsey and I wished the family well and, along with the Colombian porters, sprinted back down the mountain.

After leaving Bergkan and his family at the border, we doubled back to take the second primary land route through the Darién Gap. This one was said to be slightly easier, and cost more as a result. We had secured permission this time from the Panamanian government to follow it all the way through to the end.

After a day of hiking, we slept at another camp, where we fell in with a large group led by a Venezuelan mother of three named María Fernanda Vargas Ramírez, who had been living with her family in Chile. The original members had met on social media and picked up more travelers on their way to the jungle, until the group included 21 people, all but one of them Venezuelan. People crossing the Darién Gap tend to develop family-like bonds with other migrants they meet along the way. They look out for one another’s kids and count off when they pause to rest, making sure no one gets lost. But this group was especially close. Its members shared food and water freely and said they planned to stay together all the way to the United States.

As we neared the Panamanian border a second time, a Colombian guide who was preparing to turn back asked a few of us to look out for a woman named Cataña, whom he’d recently led down the same path but who had never come out of the jungle. He took out his phone and showed us pictures of her sitting on a bus and in what looked like a transit station. She appeared pensive, unsure what to think about the voyage ahead. “She was very slow, so the others in the group left her behind,” the guide said.

“I can’t imagine this group doing something like that,” I replied.

“We’ll see,” he said. People lose patience quickly when they’re running out of food.

This route was newer and hadn’t yet been trampled by hundreds of thousands of people. The foliage closed in from all sides, making the path hard to discern. We stepped over jaguar tracks and passed a Bothrops, the deadliest viper in South America, coiled around a branch near our ankles. In a ravine, we saw what looked like the scene of a person’s bad fall: a tennis shoe, a skull, and the bones of a leg with a bandage wrapped around the knee like a tourniquet.

Once we entered Panama, we faced new threats: robbery and sexual assault. Most of these attacks happen at the hands of Indigenous Panamanians. For years their villages were routinely ransacked by narco traffickers and paramilitary groups. Some Indigenous Panamanians took up arms in self-defense, or got involved in trafficking themselves. The government did little to protect them then and does little to stop them now.

The porters we had paid to continue on with us told us to stay close together because bandits were thought to be intimidated by large groups. Later, we learned that was false—they were in fact targeting large groups, perhaps because it was more efficient than robbing a handful of people at a time. Our anxiety grew when we passed a couple of abandoned backpacks. We pushed through thicker and thicker brush until I realized there was no longer any sign of a path. One porter accused another of leading us astray. They started arguing, until a third hissed, “No yelling!” We turned around, but a bottleneck formed in front of a fallen tree trunk. One of the porters shouted for us to hurry: “Grab the kids and go!”

At midday, we reached a camp known as La Bonga, the only place in the jungle where the Panamanian government was allowing people to sell food and water to migrants. Lynsey and I met up with a dozen border-patrol officers who had been assigned to tail us, as a condition of our making the trip. We trudged through mud and rivers for another six hours before stopping for the night. It rained on and off; the adults, sharing a handful of tents, would have to sleep in shifts.

One of the women, a Venezuelan named Adrianny Parra Peña, climbed into an airless tent, her face smeared with dirt. She and her husband had been helping María Fernanda by essentially taking custody of her 9-year-old twin boys, carrying them across rivers and lifting them up steep inclines. Adrianny told me that she’d wanted her own children but that this was the third time in six years that she and her husband had tried resettling, first in Peru, then Chile, and now, she hoped, the United States. “We are tired of all this migrating,” she told me. “This is no way to live.”

The next morning, we faced the route’s hardest obstacles, a series of rock faces. Ropes had been strung across some of them, but it was impossible to know which were secure enough to hold on to. “Oh my God, I can’t watch,” María Fernanda said when her 7-year-old daughter crossed the rock. She covered her eyes and shouted, “Hold on tight, my princess!”

When it was an 8-year-old girl named Katherine’s turn, she slipped and fell into the rocky river about 15 feet below. Her mother, who had been right behind her, stood frozen while one of the porters jumped into the water after her. Katherine emerged crying but uninjured. We started hiking again almost immediately—no one wanted to contemplate the near miss any longer than they had to.

The next day was the group’s fourth in the jungle and the 15th since leaving Chile. We came upon a fallen tree trunk covered in wet moss that we would have to cross like a balance beam above a racing river. I stopped short, certain that there was no way I would make it across without slipping. Then I noticed a little girl we’d never seen before standing alone, wide-eyed, seemingly unsure of what to do. One of the teenage boys in our group reached over, wrapped an arm around her belly, and carried her across. He placed her down unceremoniously on the other side and kept walking. I held my breath and stepped onto the log.

We started seeing abandoned tents and wondered if they meant that we were reaching the jungle’s edge, or if the people who’d left them had simply been too weak to carry even the most basic supplies. And for the first time, we saw people sitting by themselves on rocks and tree stumps, staring aimlessly into the distance, apparently deserted by their traveling companions. We crossed a river behind a family with three girls, two of whom were disabled. The eldest looked to be at least 10 but was swaddled like a baby in a sheet against her father’s chest, her long limbs flopping out. Her father slipped and face-planted, dunking them underwater. When they resurfaced, the girl was coughing and screaming. The father shook himself off, tightened the sheet, and kept going. Just off the path lay a decomposing corpse, tucked under a blanket.

The dozen Panamanian officers assigned to tail us started asking us to share the last of our food—until we ran out. They were exhausted and kept wanting to take breaks. The platoon’s medic chugged a bottle of saline solution. We’d given it to him, along with antivenom that required dilution, to hold on to as a precaution against snakebites. But the officer had a more urgent problem: diarrhea from drinking the river water.

Around midday, we reached a place called Tres Bocas, where three rivers combine—and where bodies tend to wash ashore toward the end of the rainy season. Many members of María Fernanda’s group had fallen far behind, along with half of the border-patrol officers. One officer warned us that we were still at least 13 miles from the jungle’s edge but that, because of the terrain, it would feel twice as long. We couldn’t wait for the others to catch up.

For four hours, we alternated between speed-walking and running, far exceeding what I would have thought physically possible. We finally emerged from the canopy onto a rocky beach where hundreds of migrants were waiting. Many said they hadn’t eaten in days.

We all climbed into motorized canoes driven by Indigenous people who charged $25 a person. Two hours later, as the sun set, we arrived in Bajo Chiquito, a community of about 200 people that—despite having no running water, electricity, or hospital—the Panamanian government had deemed an official reception point for people who make it out of the Darién Gap, and a key landmark amid the “controlled flow” of migration that it claims to have achieved.

The density of the jungle makes it difficult to contend at any one moment with the humanitarian catastrophe it contains, and the many policy failures that led people there. But all of that is on display in Bajo Chiquito, where the feeble systems for processing migrants are stretched dangerously thin.

Shaking from exhaustion, we climbed up a set of stairs that leads into the village. From sunrise to sunset, the entrance is packed with migrants waiting to be processed by government officials. Up to 4,000 people a day arrive here. Some have to be carried up the steps; others collapse when they reach the top.

Despite Panama having the highest per capita income in Latin America, its Indigenous people live in almost universally crushing poverty. Panamanian politicians are quick to decry how migration has changed the Indigenous way of life, but it has been a windfall for communities like Bajo Chiquito. While I was there, music blared as the migrants who had money bought food, Wi-Fi, toiletries, clean clothes, and tents. Residents walked around holding wads of American dollars, the de facto currency of the Darién Gap.

Most of the migrants I met in the processing line told me they’d been robbed by bandits at a checkpoint within a day’s walk of the community. The women said they’d been groped; some said they’d been digitally penetrated under the guise of a search for hidden cash. Panamanian border officers standing nearby showed no interest in investigating. Indigenous leaders say they have asked the government for help addressing crime against migrants, but the situation seems to be getting worse. In February, Doctors Without Borders published a report on sexual violence against migrants in the Darién Gap, showing a frequency more typical of war zones. Soon after, the government kicked the organization out of the area.

On the sides of houses in Bajo Chiquito, I saw MISSING flyers displaying the photograph of a 9-year-old Vietnamese boy with plump cheeks. Panamanian authorities had told me that children who become separated from their family in the jungle are pulled aside until the adults arrive. But within minutes of interviewing people in the processing line, I met a 5-year-old Ecuadorian girl who’d arrived with a group of strangers she’d met in the jungle. When it was their turn to be questioned, no one in the group admitted that they weren’t related to the girl. They had no documents for her, but the migration officers waved them through.

A long line of the sick and injured snaked around Bajo Chiquito’s sole medical clinic, which was opened to respond to the influx of migrants. In the open-air waiting room—a few dozen plastic chairs on a concrete slab—people vomited, nursed rashes and bloody wounds, and carried babies who’d had diarrhea for days. Doctors handed out a couple of pills for fevers or squirts of rash cream in plastic baggies, and called for the next patient.

Two women carried in a friend who had nearly drowned; she was mumbling and couldn’t lift her head. A nurse led them to a gurney and connected the woman to an IV while her three children watched in horror. The nurse returned a short while later and, though the woman was still incoherent, told the family that they would have to leave soon—the facility closed at 5 p.m. A couple of men who had just come out of their own appointments carried her to a tent as she moaned.

The next morning, migrants lined up again for canoes that would take them to a larger camp near the highway, from which they would depart for Costa Rica. Unaware that all of them would get a spot, they started shouting at one another in different languages about who had been first in line. “This happens every day,” an officer told me. I spotted the woman from the clinic asleep on a bench, her skin a greenish-gray color. Her youngest child, an 8-year-old boy, held her head in his lap, stroking her hair and swatting away flies. Her two older children were walking up and down the village, looking lost and debating what to do.

Suddenly, Lynsey and I heard screaming. We ran inside a pink house that was renting rooms to migrants and found a large family from China whom we had met at the clinic the day before. They’d had fevers for days and were sent away with ibuprofen. That morning the 70-year-old grandfather, Yenian Shao, had not woken up. His wife and daughter lay over his body, wailing and chanting.

Border-patrol officers called for a local investigator, who arrived an hour later. Using a translation app on his phone, Yenian’s son tried asking if his father’s body could be cremated or sent back to China, but he couldn’t understand the response. The authorities packed up Yenian’s body and lowered it down the side of a hill into a canoe. Yenian’s wife got in next, straddling her husband’s body bag, followed by the rest of their family. Residents were sweeping the streets of trash. Just across the river, the first new migrants of the day were arriving.

In April, we returned to Panama to visit a sleepy fishing village near the Colombian border called Puerto Obaldía. Its once brightly colored homes have weathered over the years. There are few ways to make money here. Migration used to be one of them.

For years, migrants had arrived in Puerto Obaldía on boats from Colombia. Locals sold them food, allowed them to camp, and charged them to arrange the next leg of their journey—either on charter flights to Panama City from a tiny airstrip, or in fishing boats up the coast, to another village with a paved road that connects to a highway out of the country. This lasted until 2015, when migration through the Darién Gap reached roughly 30,000 people for the first time in history, and the U.S. leaned on Panama to crack down. The border patrol began arresting residents and charging them with smuggling.

When we went, the town was in the middle of a mayoral election, plastered with posters of smiling candidates. They were all campaigning on a platform of bringing the migrants back, though none seemed to know how to do so. The candidates I interviewed, and other residents, acknowledged that at times the town had been overwhelmed. At one point in 2015, there were 1,500 migrants camped in this community of only about 600. But they insisted that the arrangement was better than the one that exists now—for them and for the migrants.

The boat rides never stopped; cartels simply took them over, labeling them a “VIP” option and charging upwards of $1,000 a person. Now the boats leave just after sunset, even when the seas are dangerously rough, and sometimes they capsize. At least five people have drowned this year, including an Afghan child.

“It’s the government’s fault that so many have died,” Alonsita Lonchy Ibarra Parra, one of the candidates, told me. Another, Luis Alberto Mendoza Peñata, said that the community had appealed to the authorities, asking why migrants can rest and refuel in Bajo Chiquito but not in their community. “We write letters. They don’t respond,” he told me. “If immigration is illegal in Panama, why is it allowed there, but not here?”

But the United States is pushing Panama and other Latin American countries to crack down more on migration, not less. Recently Panama agreed to accept $6 million from the U.S. for deportation flights. The U.S. has also been urging Panama to construct detention centers, like those that exist along the U.S.-Mexico border. Panama’s newly elected president campaigned on the promise to seal the Darién Gap completely. But an effort to do just that, announced by the U.S., Panama, and Colombia last year, had no discernible effect—more than half a million people made it through, the largest number to date. In June, the Panamanians installed a razor-wire fence across the border at the same spot where we had crossed. When I asked one of our Colombian guides what the cartel was going to do next, he replied, “Make another route.” Before the week’s end, someone had cut a hole in the fence, and migrants were streaming through.

Beyond the Darién Gap, migrants and their smugglers continue to find ways around the roadblocks set before them. Recently, hundreds of thousands of migrants have flown into Nicaragua, for example, which has bucked U.S. pressure to restrict visas.

Mari Carmen Aponte, the U.S. ambassador to Panama, and other State Department officials I interviewed said the American government was trying to balance deterrence with programs to keep migrants safe. They pointed to offices that the United States is opening throughout Latin America to interview people seeking refugee status. The U.S. hopes to approve as many as 50,000 this year to fly directly into the country, far more than in the past.

Key to these screenings, the officials told me, will be distinguishing between true refugees and economic migrants. But most people migrate for overlapping reasons, rather than just one. Many of the migrants I met in the Darién Gap knew which types of cases prevail in American immigration courts and which do not. They were prepared to emphasize whichever aspect of their story would be most likely to get their children to safety.

And too often, deterrence and protection are not complementary strategies, but opposing ones. When I told Aponte about my reporting in Puerto Obaldía, where Panama’s crackdown seemed only to hand migrants over to the cartel and force more of them into the jungle, she said she hadn’t thought about the situation in such stark terms before. She acknowledged that she was trying to make choices “between two extremes—none of which works.”

On that same trip to Puerto Obaldía, I learned that in January of this year, Panama had made what seemed like a concession to the locals, allowing them to open a small camp about a four-hour hike from the town. A group of officers agreed to accompany Lynsey and me there. On the way, a representative from the border patrol’s communications department had to stop several times to vomit from overexertion. After we arrived, the officers recovered while drinking cold Gatorade and eating a hot lunch of chicken and rice.

Nelly Ramírez, a 58-year-old woman from Venezuela, sat slumped on a bench. On her second day walking through the jungle with her daughter and four grandchildren, she had slipped on some leaves and broken her leg, and it was still oozing with pus. Other migrants had carried her to the camp while her family continued on. A woman working there had given her food and a hammock. She had no money and was panicking about what to do next. But if the camp hadn’t existed, she figured she would have died in the jungle alone.

Two days later, some of the same officers returned to the camp just after sunrise. They were not on their way to investigate people robbing and assaulting migrants in the jungle, or those who captain deadly boat rides for exorbitant fees. Instead, they declared that the people running the camp had been aiding and abetting human trafficking by selling food and Wi-Fi. They burned the camp down.

María Fernanda’s group of 21 splintered before even making it out of the jungle, when some members were caught sneaking food they’d hidden after everyone said they’d run out. After passing through Central America, those who could afford it took express buses to Mexico City. The rest slept in shelters and on the streets. One of the poorest families was kidnapped in southern Mexico. They sent desperate messages to the group, begging for money. Most said they had nothing to spare.

Orlimar and her cousin Elimar are no longer speaking. They had a falling-out at a bus station in Honduras, when Elimar grew tired of waiting for Bergkan to scrounge together enough money to continue. She purchased tickets for herself and her own kids, and told Orlimar they were leaving just as they were called to board.

Bergkan had blown up, he said, accusing Elimar of taking advantage of him. “I told her, ‘You used me like a coyote! Like a mochilero to help you with the kids.’ ”

In Mexico City, Elimar applied for an interview with American immigration officials using U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s app CBP One, which was created to streamline arrivals at the border. But she lost patience after a month and found someone to shuttle her and the kids across the border illegally. They turned themselves over to immigration authorities and were given a court date in 2029. That long a wait is not unheard-of. They now live in an apartment complex on the outskirts of Dallas, where her children are enrolled in public school. Elimar cleans offices and her boyfriend works as a cook at a chain restaurant.

Once Bergkan’s family made it to southern Mexico, they rode in a series of vans called combis, which are the cheapest way to travel on the country’s dangerous rural highways. They say they lost count of the times that narcos, police officers, and Mexican immigration officials boarded the vans and demanded bribes. They made Central Americans and Caribbeans pay more than the Venezuelans—everyone knew they were the poorest. The last group of armed men kept their request modest: “100 pesos per person,” they said, about $6. “It’s not that much.” Sixteen days after the family left Bajo Chiquito, they arrived in Mexico City.

Bergkan is now working odd jobs; he has bound textbooks in a factory and done construction in a cemetery. The family is living in a two-bedroom basement apartment with more than a dozen other Venezuelans. They have also applied to enter the United States through CBP One and are waiting for their number to be called. They could try hopping the dangerous train known as la bestia to the border, where they could cross illegally. But for now, Bergkan can’t stomach a single additional risk.

When someone dies in the jungle, their remains are usually eaten by animals or swept away by a river, or they disintegrate in the hot, wet terrain. But sometimes a body is retrieved. Panamanian authorities have offered conflicting accounts of the number of bodies recovered from the jungle—ranging from 30 to 70 a year. But these appear to be significant undercounts. In one remote community called El Real, Luis Antonio Moreno, a local doctor, told me that a mass grave dug in 2021 had quickly filled with hundreds of migrant bodies—double if not triple the reported numbers.

Moreno has operated El Real’s run-down hospital for 18 years. Its morgue is one of several in the area where bodies are taken after they are removed from the jungle. Moreno said he has processed the remains of people “from every country and every age.” Some arrive with their identification documents still protected in plastic baggies they had been carrying with them. Others are just bones. He teared up recalling two cases from last year: One was a father and son who drowned together; their bodies were still hugging when they were delivered to him. The other was a father and son who had both been shot in the head.

The morgue is next to the hospital kitchen. Moreno said the stench was often intolerable, even before the day this spring when he discovered that the air conditioner had gone out and the bodies inside were decomposing. In March 2023, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which has a program to help families track down loved ones who have gone missing while migrating, built a mausoleum in the local cemetery with space for hundreds of bodies, and it’s quickly filling.

At a recent burial ceremony, municipal workers wearing hazmat suits placed 12 white body bags into graves. Ten of the bags were labeled desconocido, or “unknown.” One bore the name of a man from Venezuela whose family had confirmed his identity. Just before the last body bag, which was also the smallest, went into the mausoleum, an ICRC worker opened it and placed a dog tag on the wrist of the 8-month-old Haitian girl inside.

After leaving Panama, I sent a message to the phone number I saw on the flyer for the missing 9-year-old boy in Bajo Chiquito. The number led me to Bé Thị Lê, the mother of the boy, whose name was Khánh.

A single mother, Bé had worked in school administration in Vietnam, but lost her job at the beginning of the pandemic. She started watching videos that smugglers posted on YouTube of the trip through the Darién Gap; the journey seemed doable. Several relatives who had already migrated to the United States sent her money to join them. Bé and Khánh traveled for nearly a month to get to the jungle, flying first to Taiwan, then France, then Brazil, and then taking buses and cars through Peru and Ecuador to reach northern Colombia.

Bé sent me photographs and videos she’d taken of her son throughout the journey, posing on boats and at transit stations. In one video, Khánh sat on a hotel-room bed, using the Duolingo app to work on his English. He was practicing the phrase Yes, coffee with milk please, nailing all but the final word. The app prompted him to repeat it again and again: please, please, please.

In the jungle, they moved slowly and quickly ran out of food. On the fifth day, they walked into a river identical to dozens they’d already crossed. Neither knew how to swim, so they linked arms with an Ecuadorian man named Juan. The rain that had been pounding all day started to come down harder, and the water suddenly changed from clear to brown, signaling a flash flood. “The water was only up to my knees, but two steps later, it was up to my neck,” Bé told me. All three were knocked off their feet. Bé grabbed onto a boulder. Juan tried to do the same, but his backpack filled with water and pulled him under. Khánh slipped out of his grip. Juan and Bé scrambled to a patch of beach and looked out in the direction where the current had taken Khánh. He was gone.

Bé said she felt all the energy drain from her body as she sat on the beach, speechless and unmovable. Some of the other migrants in their group told her they had heard Khánh call out “Mommy” as he was pulled away. They offered her their condolences and kept walking. Juan eventually persuaded her to continue on so that they could report what had happened and get help trying to find Khánh. A day and a half later, they climbed up the stairs to Bajo Chiquito.

Border-patrol officers used a translation app to take down Bé’s account. They advised her to continue on to the larger camp near the highway to make another report. She did so, then asked her brother, who lives in Boston, to fly down and help her. Together, they returned to Bajo Chiquito and posted the signs that I later found. She said that officials there gave no indication that they planned to look for Khánh, and told her that she didn’t have permission to do so herself. At her brother’s urging, Bé turned herself over to American immigration authorities to request asylum, and then traveled to Boston, where she has been working in a nail salon. “My son has always been with me, since he was born until now. I have no husband, so there are times when I am not quite there,” she told me. “Not so conscious, not quite there. I’m physically still here, but emotionally not, because I miss him.”

Without a body to mourn, she’s become obsessed with the idea that Khánh may have been pulled out of the river or washed ashore. She thinks he may have been kidnapped by someone in the jungle, or perhaps he’s being taken care of but was injured or can’t remember her phone number. She thinks he might still be waiting for her to come get him. After I wrote to her, she sent me pleading messages almost every day for weeks. “Please help me find my son.”

When I contacted a representative at the ICRC about Khánh, the organization added him to the list of missing migrants it is trying to find. Months later, there has been no news. Bé continues to write to me. “What do you believe about my son?” she asked recently. “I’m always waiting for news of my baby.”

        I, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.

This is going to require some explaining.

The story technically begins shortly after the Hamas invasion of southern Israel, in October 2023. The Houthis—an Iran-backed terrorist organization whose motto is “God is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse on the Jews, victory to Islam”—soon launched attacks on Israel and on international shipping, creating havoc for global trade. Throughout 2024, the Biden administration was ineffective in countering these Houthi attacks; the incoming Trump administration promised a tougher response.

This is where Pete Hegseth and I come in.

On Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn’t find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration’s contentious relationship with journalists—and Trump’s periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.

I accepted the connection request, hoping that this was the actual national security adviser, and that he wanted to chat about Ukraine, or Iran, or some other important matter.

Two days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the “Houthi PC small group.”

A message to the group, from “Michael Waltz,” read as follows: “Team – establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.”

The message continued, “Pls provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple days and over the weekend. Thx.”

The term principals committee generally refers to a group of the senior-most national-security officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, and the treasury, as well as the director of the CIA. It should go without saying—but I’ll say it anyway—that I have never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting, and that, in my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging app.

One minute later, a person identified only as “MAR”—the secretary of state is Marco Antonio Rubio—wrote, “Mike Needham for State,” apparently designating the current counselor of the State Department as his representative. At that same moment, a Signal user identified as “JD Vance” wrote, “Andy baker for VP.” One minute after that, “TG” (presumably Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, or someone masquerading as her) wrote, “Joe Kent for DNI.” Nine minutes later, “Scott B”—apparently Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, or someone spoofing his identity, wrote, “Dan Katz for Treasury.” At 4:53 p.m., a user called “Pete Hegseth” wrote, “Dan Caldwell for DoD.” And at 6:34 p.m., “Brian” wrote “Brian McCormack for NSC.” One more person responded: “John Ratcliffe” wrote at 5:24 p.m. with the name of a CIA official to be included in the group. I am not publishing that name, because that person is an active intelligence officer.

The principals had apparently assembled. In all, 18 individuals were listed as members of this group, including various National Security Council officials; Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East and Ukraine negotiator; Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; and someone identified only as “S M,” which I took to stand for Stephen Miller. I appeared on my own screen only as “JG.”

That was the end of the Thursday text chain.

After receiving the Waltz text related to the “Houthi PC small group,” I consulted a number of colleagues. We discussed the possibility that these texts were part of a disinformation campaign, initiated by either a foreign intelligence service or, more likely, a media-gadfly organization, the sort of group that attempts to place journalists in embarrassing positions, and sometimes succeeds. I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans. I also could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include the editor in chief of The Atlantic in such discussions with senior U.S. officials, up to and including the vice president.

The next day, things got even stranger.

At 8:05 a.m. on Friday, March 14, “Michael Waltz” texted the group: “Team, you should have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the Presidents guidance this morning in your high side inboxes.” (High side, in government parlance, refers to classified computer and communications systems.) “State and DOD, we developed suggested notification lists for regional Allies and partners. Joint Staff is sending this am a more specific sequence of events in the coming days and we will work w DOD to ensure COS, OVP and POTUS are briefed.”

At this point, a fascinating policy discussion commenced. The account labeled “JD Vance” responded at 8:16: “Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake.” (Vance was indeed in Michigan that day.) The Vance account goes on to state, “3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.”

The Vance account then goes on to make a noteworthy statement, considering that the vice president has not deviated publicly from Trump’s position on virtually any issue. “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”

A person identified in Signal as “Joe Kent” (Trump’s nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center is named Joe Kent) wrote at 8:22, “There is nothing time sensitive driving the time line. We’ll have the exact same options in a month.”

Then, at 8:26 a.m., a message landed in my Signal app from the user “John Ratcliffe.” The message contained information that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations.

At 8:27, a message arrived from the “Pete Hegseth” account. “VP: I understand your concerns – and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what – nobody knows who the Houthis are – which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.”

The Hegseth message goes on to state, “Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first – or Gaza cease fire falls apart – and we don’t get to start this on our own terms. We can manage both. We are prepared to execute, and if I had final go or no go vote, I believe we should. This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause. And if we do, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC”—operations security. “I welcome other thoughts.”

A few minutes later, the “Michael Waltz” account posted a lengthy note about trade figures, and the limited capabilities of European navies. “Whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes. Per the president’s request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans.”

The account identified as “JD Vance” addressed a message at 8:45 to @Pete Hegseth: “if you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.” (The administration has argued that America’s European allies benefit economically from the U.S. Navy’s protection of international shipping lanes.)

The user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: “VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close. Question is timing. I feel like now is as good a time as any, given POTUS directive to reopen shipping lanes. I think we should go; but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space.”

At this point, the previously silent “S M” joined the conversation. “As I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. EG, if Europe doesn’t remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.”

That message from “S M”—presumably President Trump’s confidant Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff, or someone playing Stephen Miller—effectively shut down the conversation. The last text of the day came from “Pete Hegseth,” who wrote at 9:46 a.m., “Agree.”

After reading this chain, I recognized that this conversation possessed a high degree of verisimilitude. The texts, in their word choice and arguments, sounded as if they were written by the people who purportedly sent them, or by a particularly adept AI text generator. I was still concerned that this could be a disinformation operation, or a simulation of some sort. And I remained mystified that no one in the group seemed to have noticed my presence. But if it was a hoax, the quality of mimicry and the level of foreign-policy insight were impressive.

It was the next morning, Saturday, March 15, when this story became truly bizarre.

At 11:44 a.m., the account labeled “Pete Hegseth” posted in Signal a “TEAM UPDATE.” I will not quote from this update, or from certain other subsequent texts. The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command’s area of responsibility. What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.

The only person to reply to the update from Hegseth was the person identified as the vice president. “I will say a prayer for victory,” Vance wrote. (Two other users subsequently added prayer emoji.)

According to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1:45 p.m. eastern time. So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city.

I went back to the Signal channel. At 1:48, “Michael Waltz” had provided the group an update. Again, I won’t quote from this text, except to note that he described the operation as an “amazing job.” A few minutes later, “John Ratcliffe” wrote, “A good start.” Not long after, Waltz responded with three emoji: a fist, an American flag, and fire. Others soon joined in, including “MAR,” who wrote, “Good Job Pete and your team!!,” and “Susie Wiles,” who texted, “Kudos to all – most particularly those in theater and CENTCOM! Really great. God bless.” “Steve Witkoff” responded with five emoji: two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags. “TG” responded, “Great work and effects!” The after-action discussion included assessments of damage done, including the likely death of a specific individual. The Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry reported that at least 53 people were killed in the strikes, a number that has not been independently verified.

On Sunday, Waltz appeared on ABC’s This Week and contrasted the strikes with the Biden administration’s more hesitant approach. “These were not kind of pinprick, back-and-forth—what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,” he said. “This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.”

The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group’s creator, “Michael Waltz,” that I had left. No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left—or, more to the point, who I was.

Earlier today, I emailed Waltz and sent him a message on his Signal account. I also wrote to Pete Hegseth, John Ratcliffe, Tulsi Gabbard, and other officials. In an email, I outlined some of my questions: Is the “Houthi PC small group” a genuine Signal thread? Did they know that I was included in this group? Was I (on the off chance) included on purpose? If not, who did they think I was? Did anyone realize who I was when I was added, or when I removed myself from the group? Do senior Trump-administration officials use Signal regularly for sensitive discussions? Do the officials believe that the use of such a channel could endanger American personnel?

Brian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, responded two hours later, confirming the veracity of the Signal group. “This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” Hughes wrote. “The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security.”

William Martin, a spokesperson for Vance, said that despite the impression created by the texts, the vice president is fully aligned with the president. “The Vice President’s first priority is always making sure that the President’s advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations,” he said. “Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration’s foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement.”

I have never seen a breach quite like this. It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal. But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters—not for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action. And, of course, I’ve never heard of an instance in which a journalist has been invited to such a discussion.

Conceivably, Waltz, by coordinating a national-security-related action over Signal, may have violated several provisions of the Espionage Act, which governs the handling of “national defense” information, according to several national-security lawyers interviewed by my colleague Shane Harris for this story. Harris asked them to consider a hypothetical scenario in which a senior U.S. official creates a Signal thread for the express purpose of sharing information with Cabinet officials about an active military operation. He did not show them the actual Signal messages or tell them specifically what had occurred.

All of these lawyers said that a U.S. official should not establish a Signal thread in the first place. Information about an active operation would presumably fit the law’s definition of “national defense” information. The Signal app is not approved by the government for sharing classified information. The government has its own systems for that purpose. If officials want to discuss military activity, they should go into a specially designed space known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF—most Cabinet-level national-security officials have one installed in their home—or communicate only on approved government equipment, the lawyers said. Normally, cellphones are not permitted inside a SCIF, which suggests that as these officials were sharing information about an active military operation, they could have been moving around in public. Had they lost their phones, or had they been stolen, the potential risk to national security would have been severe.

Hegseth, Ratcliffe, and other Cabinet-level officials presumably would have the authority to declassify information, and several of the national-security lawyers noted that the hypothetical officials on the Signal chain might claim that they had declassified the information they shared. But this argument rings hollow, they cautioned, because Signal is not an authorized venue for sharing information of such a sensitive nature, regardless of whether it has been stamped “top secret” or not.

There was another potential problem: Waltz set some of the messages in the Signal group to disappear after one week, and some after four. That raises questions about whether the officials may have violated federal records law: Text messages about official acts are considered records that should be preserved.

“Under the records laws applicable to the White House and federal agencies, all government employees are prohibited from using electronic-messaging applications such as Signal for official business, unless those messages are promptly forwarded or copied to an official government account,” Jason R. Baron, a professor at the University of Maryland and the former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told Harris.

“Intentional violations of these requirements are a basis for disciplinary action. Additionally, agencies such as the Department of Defense restrict electronic messaging containing classified information to classified government networks and/or networks with government-approved encrypted features,” Baron said.

Several former U.S. officials told Harris and me that they had used Signal to share unclassified information and to discuss routine matters, particularly when traveling overseas without access to U.S. government systems. But they knew never to share classified or sensitive information on the app, because their phones could have been hacked by a foreign intelligence service, which would have been able to read the messages on the devices. It is worth noting that Donald Trump, as a candidate for president (and as president), repeatedly and vociferously demanded that Hillary Clinton be imprisoned for using a private email server for official business when she was secretary of state. (It is also worth noting that Trump was indicted in 2023 for mishandling classified documents, but the charges were dropped after his election.)

Waltz and the other Cabinet-level officials were already potentially violating government policy and the law simply by texting one another about the operation. But when Waltz added a journalist—presumably by mistake—to his principals committee, he created new security and legal issues. Now the group was transmitting information to someone not authorized to receive it. That is the classic definition of a leak, even if it was unintentional, and even if the recipient of the leak did not actually believe it was a leak until Yemen came under American attack.

All along, members of the Signal group were aware of the need for secrecy and operations security. In his text detailing aspects of the forthcoming attack on Houthi targets, Hegseth wrote to the group—which, at the time, included me—“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”

        <hr/>
        Lately, I’ve been having dreams about my own execution. The nightmares mostly unfold in the same way: I am horrified to discover that I’ve committed a murder—the victim is never anyone I know but always has a face I’ve seen somewhere before. I cower in fear of detection, and wonder desperately if I should turn myself in to end the suspense. I am caught and convicted and sentenced to death. And then I’m inside an execution chamber like the ones I’ve seen many times, straining against the straps on a gurney, needles in both arms. I beg the executioner not to kill me. I tell him my children will be devastated—and somehow I know they’re watching from behind a window that looks like a mirror. I feel the burn of poison in my veins. After that comes emptiness.

Maybe everyone dreams of dying, even if not in quite this way. I once had nightmares about being a victim of crime, but after I began witnessing executions, I came to imagine myself on some subconscious plane as the perpetrator instead. This is perhaps a result of overidentification with the men I’ve watched die—and my understanding of the Christian religion, in which we’re all convicted sinners. I’m particularly interested in forgiveness and mercy, some of my faith’s most stringent dictates. If those forms of compassion are possible for murderers, then they’re possible for everyone.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

These questions, combined with a murder that tore into my own family, inspired me, several years ago, to volunteer to witness an execution—one of 13 carried out at the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, during the final six months of Donald Trump’s first term. Most of the 23 states that still have an active death penalty allow a certain number of journalists to witness executions, as does the federal government. I sent an application to the appropriate federal office and, somewhat to my surprise, it was approved.

I had been trying to compose my thoughts about the death penalty for a while, distilling them into scraps and stubs of writing, but the only certainty I had going into the Indiana death chamber in December 2020 was the simple sense that it’s generally wrong to kill people, even bad people. What I witnessed on this occasion and the ones that came after has not changed my conviction that capital punishment must end. But in sometimes-unexpected ways, it has changed my understanding of why.

Capital punishment operates according to an emotional logic. Vengeance is elemental. Injustice cries out for redress. Murder is the most horrifying of crimes, and it seems only fitting to pair it with the most horrifying of punishments. All of this made sense to me when I was growing up in Texas, and so I wondered as I approached Terre Haute if some primal part of me would feel satisfaction: Recompense had been made.

The case of Alfred Bourgeois was the kind that advocates like to cite as justification for the death penalty. Bourgeois was a deeply unsympathetic figure—convicted in 2004 of the torture and murder of his toddler daughter, Ja’karenn Gunter, at the naval air station in Corpus Christi, Texas. Prosecutors said he had bashed the girl’s head against the inside of his truck after a prolonged period of abuse and neglect. The case was federal because the murder had been committed on a military base, and now the government was about to execute Bourgeois by lethal injection.

In my memory, everything about that night is green: the neat turf surrounding the penitentiary’s media center, glistening in the rain. The paint on the window frames inside the witness room. The cat eyes of Alfred Bourgeois himself. I was green, too: nervous in my seat in front of the windows that gave onto the execution chamber, sweat beading along my hairline as I breathed hot air against my face behind a pandemic-era mask. Static crackled when Bourgeois spoke his last words into a microphone that had been lowered over him. He protested his innocence, a claim his elder daughter has posthumously pursued with limited success.

And then the prison authorities started the injection. I didn’t expect Bourgeois to thrash on the gurney as he died, but he did. Lethal injection is advertised as easy. His death was not.

Killing Bourgeois was ostensibly about justice, or at least about vengeance. But as for any visceral sense of satisfaction, I felt none: Outside in the rain afterward, I threw up on the concrete. I found the spectacle as unnatural and disturbing as the murder itself had been.

I published an article about the experience, hoping, perhaps naively, that a straightforward account might encourage some people, somewhere, to pause for a moment and think about capital punishment. For the same reason, I also decided to try to serve as a witness on future occasions. I drew a grid on the chalkboard wall of my kitchen, with room for names and dates, so that I could keep track of death-penalty cases and scheduled executions as I learned of them.

I knew this meant I was effectively siding with killers, even if only on a single issue—whether they should be put to death. Morally, that made me nervous. I wanted to be on the exact right side of things: opposed to capital punishment for principled reasons involving the dignity of human life, but at the same time opposed to defending murderers in any way that might seem to downplay the seriousness of their crimes. It felt like a precarious position.

The next execution I observed was the result of another particularly heinous murder, this one in Mississippi. In 2009, Kim Cox, the estranged wife of a man named David Neal Cox, reported her husband to authorities for allegedly molesting her preteen daughter, Lindsey. Cox was taken into custody and faced charges of sexual battery and child abuse. Nine months later, he was released on bond. He found Kim and Lindsey at Kim’s sister’s trailer, where he took mother and daughter hostage. During an approximately eight-hour standoff with police, Cox shot Kim twice with a .40-caliber handgun. As she lay dying, he sexually assaulted Lindsey. Kim died before a SWAT team stormed the trailer and rescued her daughter. Cox pleaded guilty to all charges.

In September 2012, a Mississippi jury sentenced him to death. By 2018, Cox had begun to send letters to the Mississippi Supreme Court, asking that his lawyers be fired. He also wanted to waive further appeals: “I seek to be executed as I do here this day stand on MS Death row a guilty man worthy of death.” He said he deserved to die and passionately testified to his depravity, writing to the court, “If I had my perfect way & will about it, Id ever so gladly dig my dead sarkastic wife up of in whom I very happily & premeditatedly slaughtered on 5-14-2010 & with eager pleasure kill the fat heathern hore agan.” He saw himself as divided between two “skins,” one that sought “life & relief” and one that sought “death & relief, still.” In 2021, the death-seeking skin prevailed in the courts.

I volunteered to serve as a witness at Cox’s execution, traveling to the Mississippi State Penitentiary, known as Parchman Farm, in the low plains of the Delta. It was fall, but the season hadn’t yet touched the Deep South; there were still sleepless crickets in the evenings, and grand trees in summer dress. Prison officials directed witnesses into white vans, which took us along back roads to the execution chamber.

Cox uttered his last words, declaring in a short speech that he “was a good man, at one time.” In the moment, I didn’t know what to make of that statement, and truthfully I still don’t. Did he mean to say that he was irredeemable—that the path from good to evil ran only one way? Or did he mean the opposite? And which would be the stranger thing to say in his position? In the dim witness room, I transcribed his words. As for the execution, this time I was prepared. It didn’t turn my stomach when Cox’s face subtly changed color on the gurney, from pale to flushed, as the poison ravaged his body.

Afterward, Burl Cain, the commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, held a press conference. Cain emphasized that the process had been smooth, in part owing to his own relationship with Cox, which he characterized as congenial. Cox, in his final words, had thanked Cain for his kindness. Cain said he had comforted Cox in the chamber by telling him about angels carrying his soul to heaven. A reporter asked him if he believed that Cox was truly Christian. Cain quoted Matthew: “Judge not lest you be judged.”

Of course, capital punishment as an institution relies on judgment at every level: judgment about guilt, about fairness, about proportion, about pain and cruelty, about the possibility of redemption. Judgment about how to carry out a death sentence and how to behave as one does so. And then there is the judgment that must be directed at oneself and one’s community—the distant, sometimes-forgotten participants. In all of this, I see the arc of my own evolving comprehension.

In 1764, the Italian philosopher Cesare Beccaria published his essay “On Crimes and Punishments,” one of the first sustained arguments for abolition of the death penalty, which at the time was meted out as a punishment not only for murder but for crimes such as manslaughter, arson, robbery, burglary, sodomy, bestiality, forgery, and witchcraft. Beccaria reasoned that governments have no authority to violate the rights of their citizens by taking their life and that the death penalty was a less effective deterrent than imprisonment. Beccaria’s work was widely influential in the American colonies. By 1860, no northern state executed criminals for any crimes other than murder and treason.

Conditions in the South were different. In the mid-19th century, one could be executed in Louisiana for a variety of activities that might spread discontent among free or enslaved Black people: making a speech, displaying a sign, printing and distributing materials, even having a private conversation. “Throughout the South attempted rape was a capital crime, but only if the defendant was black and the victim white,” the historian Stuart Banner observes in his 2002 book, The Death Penalty. (There is no known record of a white rapist ever being hanged in the antebellum South.) Enslaved people were subject to a wide array of capital sentences and to exceedingly brutal forms of execution. American capital punishment took on an undeniably racist character.

Over time, the range of permissible execution methods narrowed. Public hangings largely fell out of favor in the 19th century, when the spectacle of executions came to be seen as not only coarse but coarsening. Firing squads, bloody and brutal, became exceedingly rare by the mid-20th century. Executions withdrew behind prison walls as electrocution came into fashion, beginning in the late 1800s. The electric chair was used thousands of times, despite its tendency to produce horrifying unintended outcomes, such as prisoners catching on fire. Execution by lethal gas became available in 1921, but gas, too, resulted in agonizing deaths.

In the late 1960s, the NAACP’s Legal Defense and Educational Fund launched a nationwide campaign to challenge the death penalty not on strictly moral grounds but on a variety of legal ones, including the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Then, in 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court took up three death-penalty cases under the name Furman v. Georgia. Lawyers for William Henry Furman, who had been convicted of felony murder, argued that capital punishment as practiced in America—arbitrarily, and with intense racial bias—violated defendants’ Eighth Amendment protections because it imposed death sentences unfairly. The case split the Court in nine directions, with five justices issuing separate opinions in favor of the petitioner. Of those five, only two found capital punishment unconstitutional per se. The other three found that it was unconstitutional as practiced. One result of Furman was a brief moratorium on executions across the United States.

It was a hinge moment. As the death-penalty scholar Austin Sarat has noted, the “old abolitionism,” where opponents of the death penalty made their case in moral terms—mounting arguments about human worth and dignity—was giving way to a “new abolitionism,” where opponents instead focused their messaging on practical barriers to the just and humane application of capital punishment. These contemporary arguments involve factual observations about the death penalty as practiced—namely, that innocent people may be executed, that sentencing is arbitrary, that the handing-down of death sentences is heavily influenced by racism, and that the use of capital punishment is marked by horrific mishaps.

Executions resumed in 1977 after revisions to state laws. That same year, spurred by the grisly failures of electrocution, Oklahoma passed a bill permitting death by lethal injection, a form of execution that Ronald Reagan once analogized to having a veterinarian put an animal to sleep. Lethal injection was eventually adopted in every state that has the death penalty. It, too, has been the subject of much-publicized failures, as well as fierce litigation.

I learned firsthand about what could go wrong in the summer of 2022, when I received a call from a doctor who works with prisoners on Alabama’s death row. The doctor, Joel Zivot, told me that the state had likely botched the execution of a man named Joe Nathan James Jr.—sentenced to death for murdering Faith Hall, his ex-girlfriend, in 1994—and was keeping the matter secret. Witnesses to the execution reported that they had waited roughly three hours before they were permitted inside the facility, during which time James’s whereabouts were unknown, and that when the curtain to the execution chamber was finally opened, James appeared unconscious. The case drew my attention for another reason: Hall’s family, including her two daughters, had been opposed to the execution, saying that Hall believed in forgiveness and wouldn’t have wanted James put to death. I was struck by the advocacy of a victim’s family, which I wrongly assumed to have been very rare.

Time was short. James had been dead for a couple of days, and burial was imminent. The official autopsy report issued by the state’s Department of Forensic Sciences would not be available for months. With the help of James’s attorney and James’s brother Hakim, Zivot and I arranged for an independent pathologist to conduct a second autopsy to help clarify how James’s death had actually occurred.

The procedure took place at a funeral home in Birmingham on a seethingly hot day. Light shimmered above the pavement. Inside, box fans ventilated the small tiled room where James’s body lay on an examination table, draped in a shroud and a plastic sheet. When I arrived, his torso was already open, slit down the middle, with coils of intestines gathered alongside him. The top of his skull had been sawed off; his brain had been removed and sat in a clear bag. The pathologist lifted up the lungs to weigh them. I rounded the table to look at James’s inner arms.

Zivot had been onto something: Rather than cleanly inserting the two needles required for the injection, executioners appeared to have pierced James’s hands and arms all over in search of a usable vein. Bruises had bloomed near the puncture sites. Just below his bicep, there were slashes consistent with an attempted “cutdown,” when a blade is used to open the skin in order to access a vein. The number of slashes suggested multiple attempts. Mark Edgar, a pathologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, theorized that James had been thrashing on the gurney. (The Alabama Department of Corrections has denied that execution staff administered a cutdown.)

Something about the image—the blood, the nakedness, the evidence of pain—reminded me of giving birth, of the organic intensity that marks both ends of life.

I remembered Burl Cain, the corrections commissioner in Mississippi, saying he’d thought of the victims when David Neal Cox asked on the gurney if he would feel any pain. Cox, after all, had been ruthlessly indifferent to the pain of his victims. A great number of people come to the same conclusion—that to care about death-row prisoners is to slight the people they killed. But Cain made another observation: He couldn’t help the victim of this murder or her family; he could, however, help the prisoner in his custody. For that reason, he had comforted Cox. A similar desire to help, and the fact that the family of James’s victim had publicly forgiven her killer and campaigned to halt his execution, made me more comfortable with the sympathy I felt for him. I took pictures of his cuts and bruises and, in a small office at the mortuary, prayed for the repose of his soul.

Later, I wrote about James’s death, laying into Alabama state authorities for the evidently torturous execution and the attempt to cover it up. What had happened mattered. James was a human being, I meant to say, and, moreover, a member of society. It was around that time, the graphic encounter with James still fresh, that I started to dream of dying by lethal injection.

Joe Nathan James Jr., David Neal Cox, and Alfred Bourgeois were men I had never known personally. The experience of confronting their deaths was vivid, but also, on some level, remote. But that began to change.

To tell the full story of what had happened to James required reaching out to other men on Alabama’s death row. I had no idea what to expect, and was wary. The exchanges were initially terse, but in time became more familiar. I came to appreciate the personalities of the men, their relationships with one another, their complex interior worlds. Some were laconic and businesslike; others were friendly and conversational. I enjoyed talking with them—not just about the specific subject at hand but also about their life inside prison: candy bars from the commissary, visits from members of a local church, vigils for the dying.

The next prisoner scheduled to be executed in Alabama in 2022 was a man named Alan Eugene Miller, who on a summer day in 1999 had shot and killed two co-workers and a former supervisor. The other men on death row called him Big Miller on account of his 350-pound build. Charles Scott, a psychiatrist retained by Miller’s trial counsel, had concluded that Miller was delusional during his rampage. Another psychiatrist, this one for the prosecution, believed that Miller had suffered from a schizoid personality disorder at the time of the murders. Mental illness is extremely common among prisoners on death row, but the Supreme Court has never ruled that it disqualifies a person from capital punishment. Miller had a tendency to speak at length without much direction, to others as well as to himself. One acquaintance described him as “childlike.”

At first I mainly interacted with Miller through lawyers, friends, and family. Miller himself called me after the article about James was published. He was nervous but polite, with a high, reedy voice. His execution date had been set, and he wanted someone there to document what was going to happen to him. The Alabama Department of Corrections had not replied to requests I’d made about serving as a media witness to executions, and I did not entertain much hope that it ever would. But there was another way in. Each condemned prisoner is entitled to six “personal witnesses,” and Miller made me one of his.

On the night of September 22, 2022, I gathered with Miller’s family to count down the hours until midnight—after which Miller’s death warrant would legally expire. It was the first occasion I’d had to observe how a family experiences a loved one’s execution.

Miller’s family members were down-to-earth, genuine people. I had expected that they would be somber—and they were—but they also displayed a kind of gallows humor. Given the circumstances, any questions I had were ill-timed, but the family put me at ease and answered them. We were sharing something intimate: this preemptive mourning, this encounter with death.

But not long after we’d all moved into the witness chamber, a prison guard ushered us out, saying that the execution had been abruptly called off. As midnight approached, the state still wasn’t ready to proceed. Delays had been caused by Miller’s final appeals and also by technical failures in the chamber: Miller later said that he had been strapped down and pierced multiple times with needles as execution staff tried to access his veins. It would take Alabama time to secure another death warrant from the courts, and so for now, Miller would be spared.

Shortly afterward, I spoke with Kenneth Eugene Smith, the next man scheduled for execution in Alabama. One of Smith’s friends in prison had put us in touch. Right away, Smith was warm and courteous—surprisingly so, considering his situation. Pressure reveals character, and as Smith’s personality fell into relief, I concluded that whatever else he had been, he was also an amiable southern grandpa who reminded me of men I’d known in my childhood in Texas. Talking with him came easily. We connected over conversations about religion, our children, fantasy books and movies, his life on the inside. Eventually I came to think of him as a friend. His execution was scheduled for November.

Smith’s case was complicated. In 1988, Charles Sennett, an Alabama pastor, had resolved to have his wife, Elizabeth, murdered. He was involved in an affair and deeply in debt, so he took out a large insurance policy on his wife and began inquiring around town about paying for a hit. Smith agreed to take the job along with his friend John Forrest Parker. One March day, the two drove to the Sennetts’ home in the country, where they entered and found Elizabeth.

According to the coroner’s testimony, Elizabeth died of multiple stab wounds. The exact circumstances are hard to reconstruct. Smith would later insist that Parker had started battering Elizabeth, first with his fists, then with a cane—anything he could get his hands on. (Parker confessed to beating the minister’s wife, but claimed that he never stabbed her.) While Parker attacked Elizabeth, Smith ransacked the house and stole a VCR. The last time he laid eyes on her, he told police, Elizabeth was lying near the fireplace with a blanket over her body. Smith and Parker fled in Parker’s car.

Charles Sennett killed himself before he could be charged in his wife’s death. In 1989, Parker and Smith were convicted of capital murder. Smith appealed his death sentence, and in 1996, a jury handed down a sentence of life imprisonment instead. But a judge condemned Smith to death anyway—a maneuver known as judicial override, which would eventually be outlawed in Alabama. Existing sentences, however, were allowed to stand.

Parker had been executed in 2010, and Smith’s execution was now coming up. I offered to serve as a personal witness, and Smith accepted. On November 17, 2022, I spent the evening with one of Smith’s lawyers in his hotel room, relaying information as I learned it to Smith’s wife, Deanna “Dee” Smith, who was staying at another hotel nearby. Smith’s final appeal had been denied. All of us were waiting for the summons to the witness chamber. But the summons never came: The execution staff once again faced a midnight deadline and couldn’t beat the clock. The execution was called off. I relayed the news to Dee. That night, after Smith had been returned to his cell, I spoke with him and Dee on a conference call. Smith was in shock. He explained that he had been strapped down and ineffectually stuck with needles—much, I imagined, as Miller and apparently James had been. The execution staff had also jammed a long needle underneath his collarbone, looking for a subclavian vein. On the call, Dee recounted how Smith had dreamed earlier that morning of surviving his execution, marveling at what had occurred.

After Alabama failed to execute Smith in time, Kay Ivey, the governor, instituted a moratorium on executions for a few months so the state could review its procedures and protocols. (The results of the review were never made public.) When the moratorium was lifted and their second execution dates were scheduled, Smith and Miller again asked me to join them as they faced death, this time from suffocation by means of nitrogen hypoxia—according to experts, a form of killing never before used as a method of execution. Smith would die on January 25, 2024, and Miller on September 26.

I understand why people who favor the death penalty—more than 50 percent of all Americans—feel the way they do. Murder is an offense not just against a person and their family but against society itself, and all of us have a stake in how the state responds. Some people favor a lethal brand of justice, and I would have assumed, before murder entered my own life, that almost anyone directly affected by homicide would feel the same.

On a warm June afternoon in 2016, I was asleep in bed with our newborn daughter when my husband, Matt, came into the room to tell me that his 29-year-old sister, Heather, was dead. She had been stabbed to death so brutally that the first responders at the scene initially believed she had sustained a gunshot wound. The killer, a 25-year-old man named Javier Vazquez-Martinez, with whom she had been romantically involved, was apprehended after a police chase across Arlington, Texas. According to incident reports, he was intoxicated and in possession of drugs, an open container of hard liquor, and a knife. When interviewed by law enforcement, he denied ever assaulting Heather, but witnesses told police that Vazquez-Martinez had beaten her so severely in the past few weeks that she had been hospitalized. That’s the part that my father-in-law, Marty, often thinks about.

Marty is a retired forklift driver who still lives in Arlington, where Heather, Matt, and I all grew up. “Heather was a great daughter,” Marty told me. “She cared about everyone.” She was vivacious and beautiful, played basketball, and maxed out her library card every time she visited. Marty and Matt are quiet and reserved; Heather’s sociability made for a contrast. I remember meeting her: She was full of questions and seemed pleased that her shy younger brother had turned up with a girlfriend. Heather was murdered on Father’s Day, and Marty knew something was wrong when she didn’t call.

After the police notified him of her death, Marty was put in touch with a victims’ advocate, who would help shepherd him through the criminal-justice process. Eventually he was summoned to a meeting with a local district attorney in Fort Worth. Despite a lifetime in Texas, where capital punishment has broad support, Marty didn’t go into the meeting with a plan to campaign for the death penalty. “I know Heather wouldn’t have wanted it,” he explained to me. “I have Christian values and beliefs, though they wander from time to time.” He went on, “I just don’t think it’s the right thing to do. I don’t think it helps anybody.” Vazquez-Martinez was sentenced to 40 years in prison.

Like his father, my husband remains heartbroken by Heather’s death. It has been bittersweet watching her features blossom on our daughter’s face. Matt knows that the death penalty may serve an expressive purpose—signaling the depth of outrage and pain—but he ultimately holds to the same view of capital punishment that his father has in Heather’s case.

Families of murder victims routinely perform exceptional feats of mercy, if not forgiveness. “We’re pretty forgiving people, but I haven’t forgiven him,” Marty told me. Forgiveness is an emotional process that involves coming to see a wrongdoer as a moral equal again, and inviting them back into the place reserved in your heart for the rest of the world. To forgive someone who has harmed you is to forswear bitter feelings, which is to surrender a certain righteous power—the permission granted by society for retaliation. It is also therefore a kind of sacrifice. Only divinity can demand that of someone; no human being can demand it of another. And the Christian directive is especially exacting, requiring forgiveness for others in order to be forgiven oneself.

But mercy—to refrain from punishing a person to the maximum extent that a transgression might deserve—doesn’t demand half as much. It is hard to imagine forgiveness without mercy, but easy to imagine mercy without forgiveness. In his treatise On Clemency, addressed to the emperor he served, the philosopher Seneca describes mercy as “a restraining of the mind from vengeance when it is in its power to avenge itself”—in other words, a “gentleness shown by a powerful man in fixing the punishment of a weaker one.” The ruler who shows mercy is “sparing of the blood” of even the lowest of subjects simply because “he is a man.” Socially, mercy registers the value of human life. For the benefactor, it is a forge of moral character. For the recipient, it is a godsend.

The age of all-powerful sovereigns is mostly gone, but avenues for public acts of mercy remain. State governors, for instance, frequently opt to commute death sentences based on their evaluation of the circumstances. Legislators in many states have shown mercy to even the worst criminals by voting to end capital punishment. Mercy may be in some sense arbitrary, but so is capital punishment, and although mercy may produce unequal outcomes, unfairness in benefaction is better than the unfairness in harm that defines the American exercise of the death penalty. If one insists on complete and total fairness, then: no mercy, and no capital punishment.

Many people on death row are more worthy of love and respect than one might initially assume, and in such instances, mercy perhaps comes more easily. But choosing mercy is the moral path even in the hardest cases—even if you believe that some people deserve execution, even if you think you can judge the totality of someone’s character from their worst act, and even if you know for a fact that the person in question is guilty and unrepentant.

Seneca’s reasons for advising clemency are Stoic: It is better to restrain one’s impulses than to indulge them, especially when they involve destructive tendencies, such as wrath and cruelty. Self-control is a virtue, and it is possible to educate one’s desires so that they gradually change. To default to mercy is to impose limitations on one’s own power to retaliate, and to acknowledge our flawed nature. To a Christian, mercy derives from charity. And in the liminal space where families of murder victims are recruited into the judicial process—to either bless or condemn a prosecutor’s intentions—showing mercy is an especially heroic decision. To think this way is to understand that the moral dimension of capital punishment is not just about what we do to others. It’s also about what we do to ourselves.

Periodically, forgiveness and mercy meet under the right conditions to produce reconciliation. In the spring of 2001, James Edward Barber murdered 75-year-old Dorothy “Dottie” Epps during a drunken crack binge in Harvest, Alabama. He didn’t do it for money. He didn’t do it for any reason at all. His recollection of the incident was hazy, he testified, but he could recall being inside Epps’s house and picking up a hammer. For a time, Barber would later say, he was in “utter disbelief” and denial about what he had done. He fought in county jail, lashing out in shame and anger. He was living, by his own account, a “worthless life.”

But Barber slowly began to change. Isolated and restless, he began reading a Bible. And he was taken with it—fell in love with it; read it through once, then twice; and, eventually, signed up for correspondence courses. Barber became a friendly face on death row, much like Kenny Smith. “They were approachable open and willing to engage with anyone on almost any topic,” one death-row prisoner wrote to me over Alabama’s prison messaging app. “Jimmie always had a self deprecating joke.” According to his lawyer, Barber’s record inside prison was spotless. But there was something incomplete about his reform.

That changed in 2020, when he opened a letter from Sarah Gregory, Epps’s granddaughter, and found forgiveness inside. “I am tired Jimmy,” she wrote. “I am tired. I am tired of carrying this pain, hate, and rage in my heart. I can’t do it anymore. I have to do this and truly forgive you.” Barber was astonished—brought to his knees. He composed a letter of his own: “Sarah, sorry could never come close to what is in my heart & soul.” He went on: “I made a promise to myself in that nasty, dirty, evil county jail, I was never going to become ‘a convict.’ I made up my mind that when I left prison either on my feet or in a body bag I was going to be a better man than when I arrived.”

Gregory wrote back: “Receiving your letter was the final piece of freedom. The weight was lifted when I forgave you in my heart, but your response back brought me indescribable freedom and release.” The two began talking on the phone about life and God and Gregory’s son. Her forgiveness seemed to bind them together. “I love that girl more than I love anybody else in this world,” Barber told me.

As Barber’s time dwindled, Gregory realized she didn’t want to see him put to death. The day before his scheduled execution, Gregory told me that she was “losing a friend tomorrow.” She said, “I would’ve never thought I would’ve ever said that. He was a friend of mine, and I’m gonna miss him.”

On the night of July 21, 2023, I watched Barber die in Alabama’s death chamber. Afterward, his lawyers shared his final statement: “I made up my mind early on that mere words could not express my sorrow at what had occurred at my hands. And so I hoped that the way I lived my life would be a testimony to the family of Dorothy Epps and also my family, of the regret and shame I have for what I’ve done.” It wasn’t for him to say whether his efforts were successful. But they were enough for Gregory.

Barber was the first person executed after Alabama lifted its temporary moratorium and resumed lethal injections. I had corresponded with him on Alabama’s prison messaging app, and his sister-in-law had shown me a letter he’d written to her. He was joyful, kind, and encouraging—and grateful for so much, even in his position. I knew him well enough to feel certain that he was sincere in his remorse and repentance. The death penalty is, to some degree, indiscriminate: Both innocent and guilty people have been sentenced to death. But the death penalty is also morally indiscriminate in an additional way, in that it kills guilty people who may have become good people. By the time execution arrives, the offender may be a completely different person from the one who took a life. We can’t know the nature or potential of another’s soul.

Today, 27 states have abolished the death penalty or have halted executions by executive action. According to the NAACP’s Legal Defense and Educational Fund, as of last summer, 2,213 people resided on America’s death rows, compared with 3,682 people in 2000. In each year during the past decade, fewer than 50 death sentences have been handed down by American courts. The Justice Department declared a moratorium on federal executions after Joe Biden took office, in 2021, and before leaving office, Biden commuted the death sentences of 37 of the 40 men awaiting execution in federal prisons. “It’s not an irreversible momentum,” Austin Sarat, the death-penalty scholar, told me, “but I think the momentum against the death penalty is pretty substantial.”

Yet for now, in the United States, the death penalty continues. Donald Trump has signed an executive order directing federal prosecutors to pursue the death penalty in all applicable cases. South Carolina recently carried out the nation’s first firing-squad execution in 15 years, and Louisiana resumed executions after a long hiatus—this time by nitrogen hypoxia. Perhaps worried about the continued practical feasibility of lethal injection, Oklahoma and Mississippi have also made execution by nitrogen hypoxia statutorily available within their borders. It would be quick and painless, proponents said. Just like going to sleep.

Kenny Smith, who had survived his first attempted execution, would be the first person ever to be put to death by means of nitrogen hypoxia. I arrived at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility a little after eight on the morning of January 24, 2024, the day before his rescheduled execution. I was accompanied by his wife, Dee, and his nieces and nephew. We passed through a metal detector and handed over our IDs, wallets, and keys to a guard stationed outside the visitation room.

Despite having gotten to know Smith for nearly a year and a half, I had never met him in person. I was surprised to see how tall and broad he was, an imposing presence softened by a graying beard and an avuncular demeanor. “C’mere, Little Bit,” he said, breaking into a smile as he rose from the table where he sat. “Gimme a hug.” The nickname was new; Smith had called me “ma’am” the first time we spoke and “hun” after that.

Smith and I sat down at the plastic-topped table where he huddled with his son Steven Tiggleman, his daughter-in-law Chandon Tiggleman, and his mother, Linda Smith. Dee leaned toward Smith across the table and murmured to him in quiet tones. The scene had the look of a last supper, everyone gathered close with melancholy faces, grieving in advance.

Hours passed. Dee and the others had brought in plastic baggies full of quarters to clink into the vending machines. No outside food was allowed in, so we drank Mountain Dew and Sunkist, and split bags of chips and honey buns and Skittles. Smith leaned against his mother. At one point, a prison worker came in and took pictures of all of us in a group. Smith and I stood together for a photo; he somehow managed a smile. A group of Mennonites came by to sing “Amazing Grace” on the other side of an interior wall. Conversation seemed to proceed in waves of fond reverie that peaked with laughter and then crashed into silence.

As night fell, I joined Smith’s family for dinner. We met at a casino a few minutes from the prison. The place was decked out for Mardi Gras—white artificial Christmas trees stuck with floral sprays of gold, green, and purple; masked harlequin puppets draped in multicolored beads. We sat together in the casino’s steak house. Rain began to fall as we ate, and continued into the next day. The prison’s gutters were flooded and gushing onto the stony pavement as we filed in to visit Smith one last time.

No more quarters were permitted inside, no more snacks and soda. Smith could potentially vomit inside the mask, something the state hoped to avoid by depriving him of food after 10 a.m. on the day he was to die. He’d eaten steak and eggs with hash browns from Waffle House for breakfast that morning, his last meal. Then he sat with us in cheaply upholstered metal chairs and talked.

Everyone took turns crying, holding on to one another for strength. Smith wept in his mother’s arms. Steven, a reserved and courteous man, spoke quietly with his father. Smith kissed Dee, massaged her shoulders, reassured her. She wore a shirt that said Never Alone, a gloss on Hebrews 13:5: “Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.’ ” It was the same shirt she had worn to his first scheduled execution, back in 2022. Now it implied a shred of hope.

Smith led me to a couple of chairs side by side in a far corner of the visitation room and sat down with me. I was emotional, too; so much for steely journalistic resolve. Smith patted me on the back paternally and told me I could ask him anything I liked. So I asked him about his life and how he reflected on it. Smith wasn’t angry about his situation, or frustrated by the length of time he had spent alienated from society. He’d had a life before he went to prison, he told me. He had done a terrible thing, but he had also worked, had children, found love, and made friends. He had sustained those relationships behind bars, where many people wind up isolated and lonely. Smith had a vivid inner life.

Shortly after this conversation, prison officials struck me from Smith’s personal-witness list because I had brought pen and paper, something I had been told I wasn’t supposed to have, into the visitation room. Of course, this wasn’t strictly about pen and paper—it was about what I had already written and published, although the Alabama Department of Corrections denies this. I was summarily barred from Smith’s final moments and would be banned from serving as a personal witness in Alabama going forward. (And so I was unable to attend Alan Eugene Miller’s execution, by nitrogen hypoxia, in September.) But the accounts of others allowed me to follow events that night. Around 7 p.m., the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Smith’s final appeal, clearing the way for the state to carry out the sentence. The execution staff once again strapped Smith to a gurney, this time with an industrial respirator mask fixed to his face. As his family watched through the window between the death chamber and the witness room, the gas began to flow. Smith’s blood oxygen became depleted, his eyes rolled back into his head, and he began to convulse. For 22 minutes, Smith writhed and gasped, struggling for air, and then, finally, he died.

Later that night, at a press conference after the execution, Steven sought out the family of Smith’s victim, Elizabeth Sennett. He hugged them, and apologized—something he told me he had been waiting to do nearly his whole life, haunted by the burden of shame that connected their families. One of Sennett’s sons, Mike, hugged Steven back. When the reporters and TV crews were gone, Dee, Steven, and his brother, Michael, lingered with me on the patio of a Holiday Inn, smoking cigarettes and sharing shots of whiskey from a Dixie cup. Dee wept, swaying softly as she stood. Inside the hotel, she had clutched a green teddy bear Smith had given her, made from some of his prison-issued clothes, with a lock of his hair sewn inside. Now she looked at her phone as news alerts of her husband’s death popped up on the screen.

We stood and talked until midnight, when I said I had better get back to my hotel. I was feeling a little disoriented, fragments of the night’s conversations surfacing through the static in my head. I couldn’t make sense of the fact that Smith had survived once, only to be put to death in the end. Miracles are mercurial. As the time of execution approached, a reporter had asked Smith what his message to the public would be. “You know, brother, I’d say, ‘Leave room for mercy,’ ” he’d replied. “That just doesn’t exist in Alabama. Mercy really doesn’t exist in this country when it comes to difficult situations like mine.”

He was right about that. Now that he was gone, life after Smith had begun. I would clip the pictures of us together onto the refrigerator with a magnet, next to the school papers and crayon drawings. I would continue to seek opportunities to serve as a witness at executions, though now outside Alabama. I would resolve to greet the next person I met on death row with the kindness that Smith, Miller, Barber, and others had shown to me. And I would erase old names from the grid of capital cases on my kitchen chalkboard, adding new ones to take their place.

        <hr/>
        Updated at 5:23 p.m. ET on March 18, 2019.

The first Facebook message arrived when Heather Woock was packing for vacation, in August 2017. It was from a stranger claiming to be her half sibling. She assumed the message was some kind of scam; her parents had never told her she might have siblings. But the message contained one detail that spooked her. The sender mentioned a doctor, Donald Cline. Woock knew that name; her mother had gone to Cline for fertility treatments before she was born. Had this person somehow gotten her mother’s medical history?

Her mom said not to worry. So Woock, who is 33 and lives just outside Indianapolis, flew to the West Coast for her vacation. She got a couple more messages from other supposed half siblings while she was away. Their persistence was strange. But then her phone broke, and she spent the next week and a half outdoors in Seattle and Vancouver, blissfully disconnected.

It was only when she got home and replaced her phone that she saw the barrage of messages from even more half siblings. They had found her on Facebook, she realized, after searching for the username linked to her Ancestry.com account. Her husband had given her a DNA test for Christmas because she was interested in genealogy. Her heritage turned out to be exactly what she had thought—Scottish, with English, Irish, and Scandinavian mixed in—and she never bothered to click on the link that would show whether anyone on the site shared her DNA.

Apparently she did have relatives on Ancestry.com—and not just distant cousins. The people now sending her messages said they were Cline’s secret biological children. They said their parents had also been treated by Cline. They said that decades ago, without ever telling his patients, Cline had used his own sperm to impregnate women who came to him for artificial insemination.

According to her DNA, Woock, too, was one of his children.

In the time since Woock’s half siblings got in touch with her, they have broken the news dozens more times. The children Cline fathered with his patients now number at least 50, confirmed by DNA tests from 23andMe or Ancestry.com.* (Several have a twin or other siblings who likely share the same biological father but haven’t been tested.) They keep in touch through a Facebook group. New siblings pop up in waves, timed perversely after holidays like Christmas or Mother’s Day or Father’s Day, when DNA tests are given as well-intentioned gifts.

Like Woock, many of her new siblings learned that they were donor-conceived from a DNA test. (Woock’s parents eventually told her they’d gone to Cline for donor insemination, but they’d had no idea he was the donor.) And in their shock, many also thought the initial messages explaining the situation were part of a scam. But eventually they found news clips laying out that, yes, this doctor deceived his patients, and yes, he used his own sperm, and yes, this is really happening.

At least those finding out now have the benefit of clarity. They won’t have to wander through a thicket of confusion, half-truths, and lies. They won’t have to sit across from Cline, as some of the others did, and listen to him quote Bible verses. They won’t be accused of libel.

Jacoba Ballard was one of the first to piece everything together, and it had taken a long time. She’d known she was donor-conceived since the age of 10, and in 2014, when she was 33, she began looking for half siblings who shared her donor. “I was thinking one, or two at the most,” she says.

In retrospect, finding her first half siblings was too easy. She signed up for an online forum for adoptees and donor-conceived children, and quickly met another woman whose mother had also been treated by Cline. She looked the woman up on Facebook and saw her photos. “I was like, Oh my goodness, I think that is my sister, ” Ballard says. That woman knew another woman whose mother had also gone to Cline, and she had a sister. They all decided to take 23andMe tests. DNA confirmed that they were half sisters and revealed four more matches, bringing the number of half siblings to eight.

A story began to emerge from the DNA, but it contradicted the one Cline had told his patients. He’d said the donors he used were medical residents. He’d said he used each donor for only three successful pregnancies. But 23andMe showed that he’d used one donor at least eight times, and the birth years of the resulting children ranged from 1979 to 1986. Medical residencies last only a few years. What resident would be around to donate sperm for that entire seven-year period?

The answer, Ballard and her half siblings assumed, was in their DNA. No one in the 23andMe database shared enough DNA with them to be their father, but they found dozens of more distant genetic matches. By combing through public records and social-media profiles, and some times simply asking genetic matches about their families, they could build a giant family tree that, they hoped, would eventually lead to their father. Thousands of adoptees and donor-conceived children have used this method to find their biological parents, and forensic genealogists now use it to investigate cold cases like that of the Golden State Killer.

As Ballard and her half siblings researched their family tree, one suspiciously familiar name kept coming up: Cline. Finally, a woman who shared some of their DNA told them she had a cousin named Donald Cline who was a doctor in Indianapolis.

Even then, Ballard says, they weren’t sure Cline was their father. Maybe he had a brother or another male relative who’d served as the donor. Four of the eight siblings decided to file complaints with Indiana’s attorney general, saying they suspected that Cline had used his own sperm in patients and asking for an investigation. Ballard contacted a reporter for a local TV station, Fox59, which aired a segment about the unusually high number of kids from one sperm donor but stopped short of naming Cline as that donor.

For months, nothing much happened. Then one of Ballard’s half sisters went for it. She found Cline’s children—those he raised with his wife—and his adult grandchildren on Facebook and sent them a group message. A granddaughter replied, saying she didn’t know anything and couldn’t help.

But then, Ballard says, she got a message from Cline’s son. He had been looking through her Facebook photos and recognized her priest—he said he was Catholic too. He helped broker a meeting between his father and six of the siblings at a restaurant. Cline, who was then in his late 70s, walked in with a cane.

Ballard remembers this first family reunion of sorts as oddly matter-of-fact. Cline admitted to using his own sperm but said the records had been destroyed years ago. He asked each of the siblings what they did and where they lived. He read them Bible verses from a notepad. Ballard saw this as a misguided attempt to comfort her, and she snapped at him: “Don’t try to use my religion.”

Here was her biological father, but he radiated no paternal warmth. Ballard struggled with what it meant, existentially, to have inherited the DNA of a man who would lie to his patients and abuse his position as a doctor. Whatever made him do it, was that inside her, too? She knew the thought wasn’t entirely rational, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that a dark impulse might be lurking deep within her.

And what did make him do it? The half siblings turned the question over in their minds. Was it a religious thing? A sexual one?

“A need to implement this master race or something?” one speculated.

“We’re just this science experiment to him,” another suggested.

“He wanted to have control over, I don’t know, Indiana?”

“He had to maintain his business.”

“Honestly, I don’t know. I have no clue.”

“God complex.”

“Maybe he really thought he was helping people. Maybe he’s that delusional.”

When Donald Cline opened his clinic in 1979, infertility was a relatively new medical specialty. There were no big sperm banks yet, no catalogs of donors to select by eye color or hobby. Doctors usually found donors themselves, often among medical trainees, who had the advantage of being readily available in hospitals and had reputations as successful young men. (In those days, medical students were nearly all men.)

Sperm donation was shrouded in secrecy from the beginning. In 1884, a doctor named William Pancoast found himself unable to cure a wealthy man in Philadelphia who was struggling with infertility. Not one to give up, Pancoast tried something new. After sedating the man’s wife with chloroform, he injected her with semen from his best-looking medical student. This was the first documented case of successful donor insemination. Pancoast told the husband only afterwards, and the man agreed to never tell his wife. The end justified the means. The healthy baby justified the lie.

By the 1970s, hundreds of doctors were performing donor insemination across the U.S., but secrecy still prevailed. Doctors advised parents not to tell their children. A 1977 survey found that more than half of the doctors did not even keep records, so as to leave no paper trail connecting donor and child. The secrecy sprang in part from uncertainty over who would be the legal father of a donor-conceived child, a question that hadn’t yet been resolved in the laws of many states. But it also came from fear of doing psychological harm. “The child might feel rejected, the sterile husband might feel humiliated, and the wife might be condemned as an adultress,” Kara Swanson, a professor at the Northeastern University School of Law, recounts in her book, Banking on the Body.

When Liz White walked into Donald Cline’s office with her husband in 1981, she carried the weight of all this inside her. She spoke of their infertility troubles with almost no one else. It was only 35 years later—when Cline was in the news—that she and her best friend realized they had both gone to him. He was the fertility specialist in Indianapolis at the time. His patients saw him as a kind, gentle man. His office was decorated with photos of babies he’d helped conceive—a mundane detail that seems unsettling in retrospect.

White and her husband had been trying to conceive for two and a half years by the time they sought Cline’s help. They’d already seen another doctor, who’d attempted insemination with frozen donor sperm. When that didn’t work, the doctor recommended Cline, who used fresh sperm, which at the time had higher success rates. Cline said he would find a medical resident whose appearance and blood type matched White’s husband’s. He also said not to tell anyone, not even their future child, about the sperm donation.

White is 66 now, and when I met her this past fall, she greeted me at the door of her home barefoot and with her white hair pulled into a neat updo. Her house, in Zionsville, a town just outside of Indianapolis, was meticulously ordered, and her words were meticulously chosen. She told me Cline had inseminated her 15 times over five months. “I went October, November, December of ’81; January of ’82, and February,” she said, nodding her head as she ticked off the dates. She went to his office on the three days she was ovulating each month. Ovulation cycles cannot be changed for convenience’s sake, so she went in even on weekends. She remembers lying there alone in a gown, the clinic otherwise empty, and now she wonders what he was doing when he went next door to get the sample.

Until very recently in human history, reproduction always required an act of sexual intimacy. We elide this fact now, with consent forms and dense clinical language and gynecological tools that look brutishly utilitarian. But artificial insemination still requires an exchange of bodily fluids that can be procured only through sexual stimulation. (Consider: the stereotypical drawer of porn magazines at the fertility doctor’s office.) To have your doctor masturbate in his office and then to have that same doctor sit between your legs, injecting his sperm inside you—the edifice separating the clinical and the sexual breaks down completely.

It’s impossible to say exactly what went on inside Cline’s mind then. (I went to his house to interview him, but he said his lawyers had advised him not to talk. His attorneys did not respond to a request for comment.) Some of his donor children told me their mothers did not think of Cline’s actions as sexual when they found out the truth. Some mothers did not think about it much at all.

But White replayed the sequence of events in her mind. She thought of him masturbating in his office. She is a clinical social worker, and she slipped into clinical language to describe what she thought: “A man’s mind following ejaculation—there’s a lot of dopamine, a lot of serotonin and norepinephrine. All of those are mood enhancers that bring about wonderful feelings for them.” She continued: “We came in for a medical procedure.”

More than three decades later, she now says, “I feel like I was raped 15 times.”

In those same three decades, the mores around sex, assisted reproduction, and medical authority have changed, too. When the news about Cline came out, the medical community denounced his actions. “It was a breach of trust between a physician and his patient. One could say immoral,” says Robert Colver, an Indiana fertility specialist who knew Cline. “All of us were shocked.”

Would it have been as shocking 30 years ago? In 1987, a national survey of fertility doctors found that 2 percent had used their own sperm in patients. On one hand, it was clearly not the norm. On the other, it couldn’t have been so beyond the pale if it was presented as an option in a multiple-choice survey. The survey did not ask, however, whether the patients in those cases were aware that their doctor was also their sperm donor.

I asked Colver, who has been practicing since the 1980s, how such a deception could even occur to a doctor. He had trouble answering, but he noted that procuring sperm was a much more tedious and time-sensitive process back then. Cline has said he inseminated within the hour to maximize a sample’s viability. That would have meant coordinating the schedule of the sperm donor with the appointment of the ovulating patient several days a month, every month. Cline was a top fertility doctor in Indianapolis; he had a lot of patients.

Based on the birth dates of his youngest known donor children, Cline stopped using his own sperm in the late 1980s, when sperm banks became more common. (The whole industry started relying on frozen sperm then, because doctors had discovered that HIV could be transmitted through fresh sperm.) When Cline later got into legal trouble, his friends and family members wrote letters to the judge about how difficult it must have been for him to disappoint patients when a donor couldn’t be found. A friend whose wife was a patient of Cline’s—but did not have children through donor insemination—wrote:

If his friends saw this as an exculpatory explanation, those angry with Cline saw something uglier. They saw not selflessness but selfishness. They saw a doctor who cared more about his professional success than his patients’ well-being. They saw a man too comfortable in his power. If he truly believed he was doing nothing wrong, why did he deceive his patients?

Colver was more measured. He said he understood the reluctance to disappoint a patient. “Is it sad that month to say, ‘Unfortunately, Mrs. Jones, [the donor] couldn’t come because of an emergency. So sorry, we’re going to have to wait until next month’?” Of course it is. But consider the alternative: “To tell Mrs. Jones versus 30 years later having it come out like this. There’s really no comparison between the two.”

Liz White carries around a photo of herself in 1982, beaming in a hospital bed with a baby boy in her arms. She named him Matthew, “gift from God,” because she thought of the sperm donation as a gift then. She is 30 in the photo. “That’s how young I was,” she told me, which I took to mean: I know you see an old woman now, but I was young and vulnerable and alone with the man.

Matt figured it out before his mom did. After four of the half siblings filed their complaints with the Indiana attorney general, the Fox59 reporter, Angela Ganote, asked the local prosecutor about Cline. Her inquiry led to a criminal investigation. In September 2016, Ganote broke the news that Cline had been charged with two counts of felony obstruction of justice, and Matt—along with the rest of the public—learned what Cline had done.

Matt already knew he was donor-conceived. Back in high-school biology class, he’d realized that his blood type didn’t match his parents’. They sat him down and told him about the sperm donor, and no one really thought too hard about how Cline had promised that the donor’s blood type would match Matt’s father’s. White remembers feeling bad for his dad then, but the revelation provoked no deep identity crisis. His mother would sometimes point out a building when they drove down 86th Street in Indianapolis: “That’s where I got pregnant with you.” She thought of it as a joyous place. After Matt saw Cline in the news, he looked up the address. It was Cline’s old office. A DNA test confirmed what he already knew deep down. The resemblance between Matt and a young Cline is uncanny. They could be the same person.

Over the next year, Matt and his newfound half siblings watched the criminal case against Cline unfold. He wasn’t charged with rape. He wasn’t charged with battery with bodily waste—Indiana considers that a crime only if it’s done “in a rude, insolent, or angry manner.” He wasn’t charged with criminal deception—any records were long gone. In fact, Cline wasn’t charged for anything he did almost four decades ago. No law in Indiana—or in most other states, for that matter—specifically forbids a doctor from using his own sperm in his patients.

Prosecutors charged Cline with two counts of obstruction of justice: He had received letters from the attorney general’s office notifying him of the investigation, and had written back at least twice saying he’d never used his own sperm and that any woman who said otherwise was “guilty of slander and/or libel.” This was easy to disprove. Investigators showed up at Cline’s house with a search warrant for his DNA. They swabbed his mouth, and that was that.

In the 1980s, before anyone dreamed up mail-in DNA tests and internet genealogy sites, Cline must have thought no one would ever find out. As he faced the consequences now, he seemed to believe that he could make the whole mess go away by denying it with the full force of his being. Tim DeLaney, the prosecutor in this case, told me he saw the original wrong as a transgression by a person in power. When Cline was accused, DeLaney said, “he went to that same position of power and basically said, ‘I’m a doctor. These people are lying. They have defamed me.’ It wasn’t the reaction of a scared, powerless person. It was the reaction of a person used to being powerful.”

What particularly galled some of the siblings was how Cline used his faith as deflection. By all accounts, he is a very religious man—for his sentencing, several elders from his evangelical church wrote letters attesting to his character. After the restaurant meeting, Cline called Ballard to say her digging up the past was destroying his marriage: His wife considered his actions adultery. In the call, which Ballard recorded, Cline told her he regretted what he’d done—though he admitted to using his own sperm only nine or 10 times—and quoted Jeremiah 1:5, in which God lays out his plan for the prophet: “Before I formed you in your mother’s womb, I knew you.” Again, Ballard felt he was using her faith to try to manipulate her.

Cline was ultimately fined $500 and given a year of probation. He lost his medical license, but he’d been retired since 2009. If he hadn’t replied to the attorney general’s letters—which he had been under no obligation to do—he might have gotten off entirely. (Several of the donor-conceived children and their mothers have also filed civil lawsuits against Cline.)

DeLaney knows that some of the half siblings were angry that he only charged Cline with obstruction of justice, but he didn’t think he could prove any other crime in court. He still thinks about the case often. “It’s by far the most philosophically interesting of any case I ever had,” he said. Cline violated the trust of his patients, but did he also wrong their children, who wouldn’t exist if not for Cline’s deception?

For Matt White, watching all this play out awoke a sense of purpose. He’d dealt with infertility himself; his own two kids were conceived through sperm donation—the modern version, with online catalogs and donors’ baby photos. That gave him a sense of what his mother had gone through to have him. He understood why she felt violated.

I met White, now 36, at a bakery in Indianapolis last November, the morning after the first storm of the season had shellacked the roads in ice. The day before, he and his mother and several of his half siblings had had a meeting with the president pro tempore of the Indiana Senate, Rodric Bray. The senator had introduced a fertility-fraud bill inspired by Cline’s case the previous session, but it had died without a vote. Now the siblings were trying to revive the bill, which would make it illegal for doctors to use reproductive material improperly, and White had become the group’s unofficial leader. It helped that his office was two blocks from the statehouse. He could pop over for meetings.

White knows that many people may see Cline’s case as a one-off, just the strange behavior of a lone doctor out in Indiana. But a handful of other doctors have also been accused of secretly using their own sperm—in Connecticut, Virginia, Idaho, Vermont, and Canada. CeCe Moore, a genealogist who has helped adoptees and donor-conceived children find family, told me she’s come across enough cases of fertility doctors using their own sperm that “when I see these large groups of half siblings, it’s actually the first thing I think about now.” Many of the sibling groups have chosen to stay private, and their reactions run the gamut. Some siblings “think very highly of their donor father, his ‘contributions’ to their mothers,” Moore said. “Some are horrified by it.”

White was among those horrified, obviously. His mother contacted Jody Madeira, a law professor at Indiana University at Bloomington who has studied bioethics and reproductive medicine. Madeira took an interest in the case and helped write the fertility-fraud bill. “When you talk to people about the Cline case, it’s a physiological reaction of disgust, the sense that it’s deeply, morally wrong,” she says. “Is it legally wrong? It should be.”

Many of the children Cline fathered still live in Indianapolis, and they find themselves accidentally running into his family. At the bakery where we met, White pointed straight ahead. Cline, he said, “lives down the street over there. I live down the street over there, and my mom lives in town here.” Cline’s daughter-in-law is an ob-gyn at the practice White’s wife goes to. He thinks he saw Cline’s daughter, a nurse who worked in Cline’s practice, at Subway once. He got sick to his stomach and walked out. His mom saw the same daughter at a nail salon; she was getting a pedicure and couldn’t get up to walk away.

The donor children have begun cataloging the ways their own paths have crossed, too. White went to Purdue at the same time as one of his half brothers. One sibling sold another a wagon at a garage sale. Two of them lived on the same street. Two had kids on the same softball team. They’re worried that their children are getting old enough to date soon. “Did you not consider we all live in a relatively close area?” one sister said she has wondered about Cline. “Did you really think … that we wouldn’t meet? That we wouldn’t maybe date? That we wouldn’t have kids who might date? Did you never consider that?” Cline now looms over their kids’ every innocent crush, their every prom date.

Cline has admitted to using his own sperm about 50 times, which is about the number of children who have been identified through DNA. More may be out there, though—DNA testing is common but nowhere near ubiquitous. During the time I corresponded with his donor children, every few weeks one of them would tell me that another sibling had been found. In the fall, they started sending letters to Indiana legislators urging them to support the fertility-fraud bill. (It was introduced in the general assembly, and seemed to be gaining momentum.) In early January, White texted me to say he had sealed a batch of letters to legislators the night before, only to find two more siblings. He was going to add a note on the envelopes.

White’s updates about new siblings always seemed to come with a mix of anger and sadness: anger at the growing scope of Cline’s misdeeds, sadness for each additional family being turned upside down by a decades-old secret. But each new half sibling has dealt with the revelation in his or her own way.

The same Christmas Heather Woock got her DNA test, she’d made her father a book tracing his genealogy, all the way up to Scottish royalty. Losing the genetic connection with her father meant losing the story she had literally written about who she was and how she came to be. It’s this identity crisis—more than Cline’s inexplicable actions—that she’s still working through. The hardest part, she says, is “processing that my parents outright lied to me throughout my childhood.”

Kylene Gott, a 38-year-old teacher from Indianapolis, was in the car with her mom when she revealed that Cline was her biological father. Her mother’s response: “Well, good.” Well, good? “If it was going to be anyone, I’m glad it’s him.” Gott says her mom later talked about having seen pictures of Cline’s kids on the wall and how pretty they were, and how intelligent. She had wanted kids like that. But her response upset Gott, who believed her origin story explained the dislocation she’d felt her whole life in jobs and in social situations. “I haven’t really known who I am; that’s why I haven’t been able to figure out what I’m supposed to do in the world,” she says. She was thrilled to have new half siblings, and she dissected their lives for similarities, from favorite McDonald’s orders to the bouquets in their wedding photos.

Another woman in Indianapolis, whom I’ll call Amy, told me her mother was strangely calm when she heard about Cline. (Some of the donor children asked me not to use their real names, because they hadn’t told everyone in their lives about their paternity.) Her mom’s reaction was especially unnerving because Amy thought Cline was supposed to have used her father’s sperm, not a donor’s, and this deception struck her as even more grotesque. A few weeks after we spoke, Amy emailed to say we had to talk. She had confronted her mother, who revealed that she’d always known it was a donor, if not Cline himself. When Amy was conceived, her parents had promised never to tell—a promise her mom had kept even though Amy’s father died years ago. Amy wishes she’d never learned the truth. “Ignorance is bliss,” she told me, wistfully drawing out the last word.

A man I’ll call Tyler, who is a construction manager in Washington, D.C., told me that his mother, too, said she’d thought Cline had used her husband’s sperm. But, oddly, she didn’t seem angry at Cline so much as angry at being found out. She made Tyler swear never to tell his dad. “You and I gotta take it to the grave,” she said. Tyler now wonders whether she knew all along that the sperm came from a donor, even if she didn’t know that donor was Cline. He still hasn’t talked with his dad about it.

Joseph (not his real name) has a twin brother, but they look nothing alike. “I’m taller than him. He outweighs me by 30 pounds,” he says. They have different personalities, too. When Joseph took a DNA test in 2017 and discovered his paternity, he and his twin briefly wondered whether they had different fathers, because Cline had told their mother he’d mixed a donor’s sperm with her husband’s. But no: They both had Cline’s DNA. True to their different personalities, they reacted in opposite ways. Joseph has been very involved with the Facebook group, while his twin wants nothing to do with it. Strangest of all, Joseph met a half brother who looks exactly like him—much more so than his actual twin.

They are just a few of the many people forging connections after the initial shock of a DNA surprise. Adoptees have reunited with their birth families. Donor-conceived children have found their biological fathers. And half siblings have met one another, creating new iterations of family entirely different from the traditional family unit their parents were seeking when they went to a fertility doctor.

In June of last year, on Father’s Day weekend, the siblings gathered in Indiana for their second annual picnic. They’d been getting together in smaller groups, for holidays, girls’ nights, lunches, and meetings with state legislators. But this was the big shebang. Tyler flew in for the day from Washington. Spouses and children came too. Matt rented out a picnic pavilion, and brought name tags because many of the siblings were meeting for the first time. Their numbers had almost tripled since the previous year.

Everyone pitched in a little. One sibling brought a birthday cake, which was becoming a tradition. Kylene brought chips and salsa. Amy made pasta salad. Heather thought to bring much-needed packs of bottled water. Matt brought chicken wings, and he sweated over the grill cooking them. It was a hot day. Their kids ran through sprinklers. They climbed trees and got sticky with sap. From afar, it must have looked like any family reunion.

        This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from The Atlantic, Monday through Friday. Sign up for it here.

Anne Kenner worked for many years as a federal prosecutor, first in the Eastern District of New York, and then in the Northern District of California, trying mobsters and drug dealers. “I like the hairy edge,” she told me. Her job was meaningful to her; it made her feel useful. When she became disturbed by the powerlessness of some of the young people caught up in the system, she developed a curriculum to help students understand their rights if they came into contact with law enforcement: Here’s what to do if the police stop you; here’s what to do if a cop asks to look inside your backpack.

A turning point in Kenner’s life came when she was in her 50s. Her brother, who had been troubled since childhood, shot and killed himself. They’d had a difficult relationship when they were kids, and she hadn’t spoken with him in 33 years. He had cut off almost all contact with her family decades earlier, as his life spiraled into reclusive paranoia. Still, she told me, his death “was a massively tumultuous experience. I wanted to understand why I was knocked sideways personally.”

Around that time, she heard about what was then a new program at Stanford University called the Distinguished Careers Institute. It’s for adults, mostly in their 50s and 60s, who are retiring from their main career and trying to figure out what they want to do with the rest of their lives. The fellows spend a year learning together as a cohort of a few dozen, reinventing themselves for the next stage. “Somebody told me it offered breathing room, a chance to take a step back,” Kenner recalled.

But that is not how she experienced it: “It wasn’t breathing space; it was free fall.”

On her first day, Phil Pizzo, who’d been a researcher and dean of Stanford’s medical school before founding the program, told the group to throw away their résumés: “That’s no longer who you are. That’s not going to help you.” Kenner took his words to heart. “I thought, Okay, nothing I’ve done matters. Everything I do going forward has to be different.”

Kenner’s first few days on campus were a shock. The fellows, most of whom had been wildly successful in tech or finance or some other endeavor, were no longer running anything. They were effectively college freshmen again, carrying backpacks, trying to get into classes, struggling to remember how to write a term paper. One day Kenner walked into the program’s study area and saw “the guy who was the biggest success and the biggest asshole” in the program lying on his back on the floor.

“What are you doing down there?” Kenner asked.

He couldn’t answer; he was hyperventilating. “This 65-year-old brilliantly successful man was in a total panic” because of the changes to his life, Kenner recalled. Over the ensuing year, she continued, “he became a dear friend.”

At one point during the program, the fellows are asked to get up and tell the group something important about their life journey, something deeper than the items on their CV. Kenner talked about her brother. It was a transformative experience: For her family, her brother’s troubled nature had always been shrouded in secrecy, and not openly discussed. But “keeping secrets was very dangerous in my family,” she now realizes. “Telling my brother’s story was my declaration of independence from all that.”

Her life has a new direction now. When I talked with her in May, a few years after her Stanford experience, she was working with the Magic Theatre in San Francisco to workshop a play she had written about Henry VIII’s second wife, Anne Boleyn, one of Kenner’s lifelong heroes. The play was in rehearsals as we spoke; readings ran during the daytime and Kenner rewrote scenes in the evenings. “I can’t sleep, it’s so exciting,” she told me. “I’m a pretty controlled person. I’m not much of a crier and these theater people are such emotional people. They’re crying all the time. I’m learning to go with that.”

She reflected on one of the things she had learned during her second education in the Stanford DCI program: “It’s all about putting myself in situations in which I know nothing. I can fail big. Who gives a shit? I’m 64.”

Stanford, Harvard, and Notre Dame have three of the most established postcareer programs in the U.S., but others are popping up. I learned about them when my wife and I agreed to teach at the University of Chicago’s version, the Leadership and Society Initiative, which launches this fall. These programs are proliferating now because we’re witnessing the spread of a new life stage.

The idea of adolescence, as we now understand it, emerged over the course of the first half of the 20th century. Gradually people began to accept that there is a distinct phase of life between childhood and adulthood; the word teenager came into widespread use sometime in the 1940s.

In the 21st century, another new phase is developing, between the career phase and senescence. People are living longer lives. If you are 60 right now, you have a roughly 50 percent chance of reaching 90. In other words, if you retire in your early or mid-60s, you can expect to have another 20 years before your mind and body begin their steepest decline.

We don’t yet have a good name for this life stage. Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot, a notable scholar in this area, calls it the “Third Chapter.” Some call it “Adulthood II” or, the name I prefer, the “Encore Years.” For many, it’s a delightful and rewarding phase, but the transition into it can be rocky.

For the participants in these programs, who are largely upper-middle-class and well educated, their careers have defined their identities. Their sense of significance derived from their professional achievements. What happens when that all goes away?

Over the past few months, I’ve had conversations with people who are approaching this transition or are in the middle of it. These conversations can be intense. One senior executive told me that he fears two things in life: retirement and death—and that he fears retirement more.

The business consultant William Bridges argued that every transition involves a period of loss, then a period in the neutral zone, and then a period of rebirth. The loss that comes with retirement can be brutal. Some highly successful people mourn the life that gave them meaning and made them the center of the room. People in the neutral zone don’t yet know who the new version of themselves will be. They report feeling hollow, disoriented, empty.

One 70-year-old told me that when she retired, she learned that she’s bad at predicting what will make her happy. Many of the activities she’d planned to pursue turned out to be dull or unfulfilling. Another retiree told me that, unexpectedly, the thing he misses most about his job is the work emails—the feeling that he was inside the information flow. “It’s the recognition of loss that brings people to programs like ours,” Tom Schreier, who was the vice chairman of the investment-management firm Nuveen in Chicago and who now directs Notre Dame’s Inspired Leadership Initiative, told me. “When they ran an organization, they thought they had 200 great friends. Suddenly, only five are as responsive as they used to be.”

These folks are in the middle of what the psychologist Erik Erikson called a developmental crisis. People will either achieve generativity—a way of serving others—or sink into stagnation. At an age when you think they’d be old enough to know the answers, they find themselves thrown back into fundamental questions: Who am I? What’s my purpose? What do I really want? Do I matter?

These academic programs are meant to help them answer those questions. The people in the Stanford, Harvard, and Notre Dame programs are not average Americans. Most are ridiculously privileged, affluent enough to pay the steep tuition costs and to move for a year to places like Palo Alto or Cambridge. Their lives are a million miles away from the great bulk of humanity who either can’t afford to retire, or who are one setback away from real financial stress, and can’t afford to take a year off to contemplate meaning and purpose.

But the lessons the super-elite learn there apply more broadly than just to them. People at all income levels derive some of their identity from how they contribute to the world and provide for those they love, and people at all income levels feel a crisis of identity, and get thrown back on existential questions, when those roles change or fade away. The working poor struggle with blows to their identity when age or infirmity demands that they cut back or change jobs, even if they have to keep laboring, and even though they don't have the luxury of taking classes where they can engage in deep thought. While the people who attend these programs have built their lives around the pursuit of high-status careers in a way that makes them especially prone to experience profound crises when that success and status are in the rearview mirror, the lessons they learn here have wisdom for all of us.

I’m fascinated by these programs because, among other reasons, I’m hoping they can serve as an antidote to the cultural malady that The Atlantic’s Derek Thompson calls workism. This is the modern way of thinking that, he writes, “valorizes work, career, and achievement above all else.” Many Americans, he continues, have come to assume that work can provide everything that humans once got from their religion—meaning, community, self-actualization, a sense of high calling.

Modern life is oriented around the meritocracy, which implies certain values—that life is best seen as a climb toward the top, that achievement is the essence of a good life, that successful people are to be admired more than less successful people. But this overreliance on our work identities is unhinging us.

Since the dawn of the modern age, people have been complaining about the hollowness of the rat race, but nobody ever does anything about it. If these post-professional programs can help older people figure out what a fulfilling life looks like when work and career are no longer in the center, then maybe they’ll have some lessons for the rest of us. The emergence of a cohort of people who are still vital and energetic but who are living by a different set of values, creating a different conception of the good life, might help the broader culture achieve a values reset.

Most revolutions come from the young. Is it possible that the one we need now will be driven by the old?

Some people enter one of these programs looking for a relatively simple vocational shift. They have a vague sense that now is the time to give back, so they figure their next life will look similar to their old one, only with more do-gooding. But many soon discover that they underestimated how much of their previous life was oriented around career success. They underestimate the power of the workaholic mentality they’ve adopted—goal-centered, strategic, rationalistic, emotionally and spiritually stunted.

“We cannot live the afternoon of life according to the programme of life’s morning,” Carl Jung observed. “For what was great in the morning will be little at evening, and what in the morning was true will at evening have become a lie.” As they leave their corner-office jobs, these erstwhile masters of the universe are smashing into this blunt reality.

Susan Gianinno, who was the CEO of the advertising firm J. Walter Thompson, attended the Harvard Advanced Leadership Initiative and is now a co-chair of the program’s alumni association. She observes that in high-powered jobs, life is all about instrumentality and performance—optimizing effort and delivering results. But when you get to the stage beyond your work life, that mentality is not relevant. “The key shift is to go from mastery to servant,” Gianinno told me. When you’re in a high-powered work environment, you think of yourself as a master of performance. But to succeed in this new phase of life, “you have to serve.”

The fellows have to cast aside the impressive persona their ego wants them to project—a worldly success, someone important. Jacob Schlesinger was a reporter for The Wall Street Journal for more than 30 years. “There was a period when it was a thrill to see your name on the front page,” he says. But the thrill waned, the process of reporting stories grew more bureaucratic and grinding, and he realized he didn’t want to do it anymore. He enrolled in the Stanford program but entered carrying that impressive Wall Street Journal identity with him. When he went to a doctor appointment while at Stanford, Schlesinger told me, the first thing the doctor said was, “Oh, you work at The Wall Street Journal.”

But gradually, that identity dissipated. New interests emerged. “I immersed myself in spirituality,” Schlesinger said. “I also took a lot of improv classes. I feel stupid saying this, because I used to think it was all stupid—I called it the ‘vulnerability industrial complex.’” He enrolled in a memoir class. “It was jaw-dropping what people were willing to reveal,” he said. “Doing this program opened my mind.”

Beating the meritocratic values out of a 65-year-old requires a very different pedagogy than beating them into a 20-year-old. These programs differ from collegiate programs in a variety of ways. In these classrooms, for starters, teachers and students are similarly aged peers. There are no grades or class rankings—the normal measures of meritocratic rank and status. The readings are shorter than you might assign to a college student. (When I’ve led seminars with middle-aged adults, I’ve found that they can’t get through texts that are easy for college students—their deep-reading skills deteriorated as their career progressed.) But these readings don’t seem so central anyway, because almost every person I spoke with said the single most important part of their program was the chance to walk through this life transition with new friends. “I now have 30 new friends,” Margaret Higgins, who attended the Notre Dame program, told me. “Who in their 60s has 30 good new friends?”

The students serve as mutual support societies for one another as they make a vocational leap of faith. “I wanted a future I couldn’t predict,” Susan Nash, a former litigator, told me. Letting go of the wheel is going to be hard “if control has been your MO,” Father Dan Groody, who teaches in the Notre Dame program, told me. “It’s hard but liberating.”

In my conversations with this cohort, I would confess that the demands of my own career have made me obsessively time-focused. I have this clock ticking in my head. When I pull into a gas station to fill up my tank, I think compulsively to myself: You’ll have 90 free seconds; you can get two emails done. The Encore types responded to my confession with the indulgence you might offer a small child. They’d learned to slow down enough to feel. Some of the programs assign Abraham Joshua Heschel’s book The Sabbath to help students learn to pause. “We start by stopping the busyness train. If you want to go deeper into the heart’s desire, you need to create the silence to hear it,” Father Groody said.

As the fellows shed the optimization mindset, time stretches out. There isn’t a long-term career trajectory to manage. There’s more freedom to ask What do I want to do today?

At their best, the programs compel students to ask some fundamental questions, and to come up with new answers. The first question is Who am I? The programs run people through various exercises that help them reflect on their lives. At Stanford, many students take a memoir-writing class. At Notre Dame they go to cemeteries and write their own obituary.

They are learning to get beyond conceiving of their lives as just a series of résumé notches. They are also learning to think in different ways. The psychologist Jerome Bruner argued that there are two modes of thinking: paradigmatic mode and narrative mode. Put simply, paradigmatic mode is making the case for something; narrative mode is telling stories.

Most of us spend our careers getting good at paradigmatic mode—making arguments, creating PowerPoint presentations, putting together strategy memos, writing legal briefs. But in plotting the next chapter of their lives, the fellows need to update their story, which requires going into narrative mode. They have to weave a tale of how they grew and changed, going back to childhood.

The programs use various devices to help students see themselves at a deeper level. Harry Davis, a longtime management professor at the University of Chicago who is an adviser to and teacher in its Leadership and Society program, asks his students to identify their core self, their visible self, and their best self. At Notre Dame, instructors draw on Thomas Merton’s theories about self and identity, asking students to describe both their true self and the false self they show the world. Tom Schreier, the Notre Dame program director, observes that most people find themselves surprisingly unfamiliar with their true self.

The second big question the students must answer is What do I really want? When we’re young, we tend to want what other people want: the things that will bring affirmation, status, and financial gain. But in the Encore phase, students are compelled to move from pursuing the extrinsic desires the world rewards to going after their intrinsic desires.

That process can be daunting. Father Groody remembers that “one day we were introducing the topic of the inner world and the heart’s desires. There was palpable tension in the room. People were getting red in the face; their veins were popping out. These were these high-achieving folks and to many of them, the idea of sharing from vulnerable spaces … that was just really frightening.”

Many people in this stage of life realize that they abandoned some dream on their way up the career ladder—the dream of becoming a musician or a playwright or a teacher. They pick up the lost strands—the activities and the talents that have gone unrealized—and build their new lives around them.

“The hard thing to do when you get old is to keep your horizons open,” the theologian and civil-rights hero Howard Thurman once wrote. “The first part of your life everything is in front of you, all your potential and promise. But over the years, you make decisions; you carve yourself into a given shape. Then the challenge is to keep discovering the green growing edge.”

The third question for the students is What should I do? Many fellows enter the programs thinking they’ll take on some project that is adjacent to their previous career. A real-estate developer may want to work on affordable housing. But according to Schreier, there turns out to be nearly zero correlation between the thing students want to do at the beginning of the year and the thing they want to do at the end. Their horizon of options widens.

Many of the alumni I spoke with have launched or joined programs to take on big, obvious social problems: school reform, homelessness, the dearth of women of color in tech. But I was most entranced by the people doing little things with great joy. Davis, who has worked as a management professor at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business for 60 years, told me, “I want to open a bakery. I don’t want to run it. I just want to bake.” Susan Nash, the former big-time lawyer, talked with great enthusiasm about how much fun she’s having reporting for a local wire service. After a career in venture capital, M. J. Elmore took a course in art history while at Stanford and now paints. “I’m in the third trimester of life,” she told me. “I’m filling it with painting.”

“People in these programs do not care what you did before,” Nash told me. “We all start over in forming new identities.” Many of the students ultimately end up not missing their sparkling careers; in fact, they can’t believe they allowed themselves to be stuck in those professional ruts for all those decades. Students in the middle of the program come up to Father Groody and say, “How did I miss this for so long?” They are grieving, he said, telling him, “I should have done this earlier.”

For people like me, still in full-bore career mode, hearing this is jarring. We throw ourselves into work, consumed by finishing this or that project, convinced that each professional task is truly important. And yet if what these oldsters say is true, it’s likely that at some point we’re going to leave it all behind and not look back.

What lesson should the rest of us glean from these folks? If you’re 35 or 49 or 57 and see people living their deepest lives after they’ve shed the curse of workism, should you drop out of the rat race and take this whole career thing less seriously?

That’s the conclusion that many young people I know are drawing. They look at the manic careerism of the older generations and see a recipe for an anxious, exhausting, and existentially empty life. Maybe you’ve encountered the TikTok influencer Gabrielle Judge, who popularized the #lazygirljob meme. The idea behind #lazygirl (and also behind the ostensible trend toward “quiet quitting”) is that you should find a job that will pay the bills but won’t demand much of your time or passion. Abandon the ordeal of careerism and devote your energies to the daily pleasures of life.

Maybe I’m stuck in a generational rut, but my own view is that the #lazygirl approach isn’t quite right. If you make only a half-assed commitment to your work, you’re settling for mediocrity in an endeavor that will necessarily absorb a large chunk of your life. And if you decide to prioritize pleasure, you’ll spend your days consuming random experiences that you’ll measure on shallow, aesthetic grounds—was today tasty or bland? You’ll accumulate a series of temporary experiences that don’t add up to anything substantial.

The people who enroll in Encore programs have chosen purpose over leisure. In their senior years, they’ve revealed something I take to be a general human truth: Most of us don’t just want simple happiness; we want intensity. We want to feel that sense of existential urgency you get when you are engrossed in some meaningful project, when you know you are doing something important and good. These programs don’t quiet ambitions so much as elevate them, redirect them toward something generous—whether it’s a grand project, like reforming schools, or a local passion, like painting, baking, or writing a play about Anne Boleyn.

But how on earth did we end up with a society in which 65-year-olds have to take courses to figure out who they are, what they really want, and what they should do next? How did we wind up with a culture in which people’s veins pop out in their neck when they are forced to confront their inner lives?

The answer is that we live in a culture that has become wildly imbalanced, like a bodybuilder who has pumped his right side up to excessive proportion while allowing his left side to shrivel away. To put it another way, a well-formed life is governed by two different logics. The first is the straightforward, utilitarian logic that guides us through our careers: Input leads to output; effort leads to reward; pursue self-interest; respond to incentives; think strategically; climb the ladder; impress the world. This is the logic that business schools teach you.

But there is a second and deeper logic to life, gift logic, which guides us as we form important relationships, serve those around us, and cultivate our full humanity. This is a logic of contribution, not acquisition; surrender, not domination. It’s a moral logic, not an instrumental one, and it’s full of paradox: You have to give to receive. You have to lose yourself to find yourself. You have to surrender to something outside yourself to gain strength within yourself.

If career logic helps you conquer the world, gift logic helps you serve it. If career logic focuses on “how” questions—how to climb the career ladder, how to get things done efficiently—gift logic focuses on “why” questions, such as why are we here, and what good should we ultimately serve? If career logic is about building up the ego, gift logic is about relinquishing it and putting others first.

A well-lived life, at any stage, is lived within the tension between these two logics. The problem is that we have managed to build a world in which utilitarian logic massively eclipses moral logic. The brutal meritocracy has become such an all-embracing cosmos, many of us have trouble thinking outside of it. From an early age, the pressure is always on to win gold stars, to advance, optimize, impress. That endless quest for success can come at the expense of true learning. Many of the students I’ve taught over the years don’t have time for intellectual curiosity or spiritual growth—a condition that only worsens through adulthood as their obligations proliferate.

I see these Encore programs as green shoots, little buds for a new set of countercultural institutions for people who have thrived in the meritocracy but are now eager to live according to gift logic. They are hoping to live in the sides of themselves that have atrophied—to live a spiritual life, a life of moral purpose. These programs are places where it’s okay to think about purpose, okay to want to shed your old workist identity, okay to orient your life around the ideal of self-sacrificial service. At their best, these programs are trying to cultivate moral imagination, so that people can picture a nobler life and muster the courage to go out and live it.

These programs should not just be for rich people; they are in urgent need of democratization. Tens of millions of people transition to their Encore phase every year. Attending less rarified versions of these programs, if only for a couple of weeks or sporadically throughout the year, should be a rite of passage leading up to retirement. Phyllis Moen is a life-stages scholar who studied some of the established Encore programs before starting one of her own at the University of Minnesota. Her program isn’t geared toward the masters of the universe but rather to middle-class types—teachers, small-business owners, some physicians. She says her fellows at Minnesota confront the same challenges as the CEO types at Stanford and Harvard—the same loss of identity, the same need to retell their life story, the same uncertainty about what to do next. Differences in social class don’t necessarily mean differences in the crisis of identity that confronts people upon retirement.

Shouldn’t there be more programs like Moen’s, that balance utilitarian logic with moral logic for different phases of life? I’m not an entrepreneur, but while working on this story, a fantasy kept popping into my head: Somebody should start a company called Transition Teams. This would be a firm that helps people organize into cohorts during life’s crucial transitions—after college, after divorce, after a professional setback, after the death of a spouse, after retirement. These are pivotal moments when the most humane learning takes place, and yet America today lacks the sort of programs or institutions that could gentle the transitions and maximize the learning through mutual support. (In the old days, the Elks Club or the Ladies Auxiliary or the VFW hall or your worship community might have helped, but they’ve receded in recent decades, as has been well documented.)

These programs wouldn’t have to be expensive: Rent some rooms at a local college or at the local library. Offer a choice of different curricula. Hire facilitators to keep the conversations going. Let the participants themselves run the show.

The human hunger for meaning and fulfillment is strong. And yet America today is too awash in workism and too short on purpose. We shouldn’t have to wait until we’re 65 to learn how to transform our lives. Maybe the people reinventing themselves now in these Encore programs can show the rest of us the way.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> The article examines the '5 to 9' social media trend, where vloggers document highly structured personal routines before and after their workdays. It argues that this drive for efficiency turns leisure time into a second shift of labor, reflecting a societal pressure to operationalize rest and remain productive even outside of professional hours.

        The shift begins when she leaves her desk at 5 p.m.

She drives home, arriving at 5:45. Five minutes later, she’s starting a load of laundry; at 6 p.m. she changes into workout clothes. By 6:25 she’s on the treadmill for precisely 30 minutes. At 7 o’clock she grabs a grocery delivery from her front porch and unloads it. At 7:15 she makes an electrolyte drink. Shower time is at 7:25. At 8 p.m. she cooks up some salmon and broccoli; at 8:25 she plates her dinner while tidily packing up the leftovers. Not a moment is wasted.

This is one woman on TikTok’s version of the “5 to 9 after the 9 to 5.” Over the past couple of years, the vloggers of social media have taken to documenting their routines from 5 to 9 p.m. Some creators also make a morning version, the “5 to 9 before the 9 to 5,” starting at 5 a.m. These routines are highly edited, almost hypnotic, with quick cuts, each mini-scene overlaid with a time stamp. Hours pass in just a couple of minutes, and the compressed time highlights a sense of efficiency. The videos have big to-do-list energy; the satisfaction they offer is that of vicariously checking boxes.

In the past few weeks, I have lived months’ worth of compressed mornings and evenings with 5-to-9 vloggers. They are a self-selecting crew, certainly. But the sheer volume of hours that I consumed allowed me to see, in a big-picture way, how the need to be productive seeps into people’s leisure time—time that ideally would be free of such concerns. These videos reflect a truth that predates and will almost certainly outlive them: When life revolves around work, even leisure becomes labor.

One way to look at 5-to-9 videos is as the product of people trying to make the most of the leisure time they have. Given how many of these videos are made by people in their early 20s, I see in them a new generation entering the workforce and acclimating to the reality that time is limited. But in attempting to take control back from their jobs, many 5-to-9 video creators end up reproducing a version of the thing they are trying to distance themselves from. If you clock out, go home, and continue checking things off a list, you haven’t really left the values of work behind. One woman I saw details the “five nonnegotiables” for her 5 to 9, the things she must achieve each evening: exercise; a healthy, home-cooked meal; a shower; a skin-care routine; and a clean kitchen. After she ticks all those boxes, the night is nearly over. Not much time remains for anything unplanned. Many creators also use part of their leisure time to plan for the upcoming workday, laying out outfits for the morning or writing their schedule in a planner.

The threat of waste looms over many nighttime-routine videos—“X Number of Things I Did to Stop Wasting My Evenings” is a common title formula. (Recommendations include multitasking so you can get more done at once, and “Whatever you do, do not sit down.”) What exactly you accomplish almost doesn’t matter—a spotless house, a completed Pilates class, an “everything shower”—so long as you’ve been a busy little bee whom no one could accuse of wasting time. The idea that unproductive time is time squandered is not unique to the 5 to 9; it pervades much of the American approach to leisure. “In a capitalist society, we do feel like we have to prove our worth through our productivity,” Pooja Lakshmin, a psychiatrist and the author of Real Self-Care, told me. By inverting the “9 to 5” formulation of a corporate workday, these videos present free time explicitly as another shift, one you hire yourself to work.

Katlin Marisol Sweeney-Romero is an assistant professor of cinema and digital media at UC Davis who has written about other productive-vlogging trends on TikTok. In 5-to-9 videos, she told me, “the main message is not about how to rest, but: How do you operationalize rest to still be a productive part of your day?” Several evening-routine videos show the creators editing their content, and Sweeney-Romero pointed out that even the most relaxing vlog still has a whiff of labor about it—because someone had to shoot, edit, and post it.

Conspicuously missing from most of the videos I watched is any kind of socializing, which corresponds with the fact that Americans have been spending more and more time alone over the past couple of decades. After watching scores of solitary evenings, I deliriously started searching 5-to-9 friends and 5-to-9 community??? and found a handful of examples. The sight of people eating together, laughing, and walking outside in the sunlight was refreshing after hours of scrolling through videos of tasks completed alone in greige apartments with overhead lighting. But these videos were few and far between—other people can be an obstacle to running your life with the precision of a ticking watch.

In most 5-to-9 videos, we get little sense of people’s actual jobs, save for the times they log back on in the evening, or the glimpses they show of their side gigs as content creators. What they highlight instead is the way a work mindset can follow you home and shape your leisure in its image. For many Americans, work is the focus of life, the place to find purpose and a sense of self. My colleague Derek Thompson has dubbed this “workism”—the religion of work. A 2023 Pew survey found that a majority of Americans—71 percent—rated “having a job or career they enjoy” as an “extremely” or “very” important ingredient for a fulfilling life. Work also gets prioritized in many people’s lives out of necessity. Research shows that people in countries with high levels of economic inequality, such as the United States, tend to have worse work-life balance.

It wasn’t always this way. In much of the 19th and early 20th centuries, “the view was that leisure was the place where we would find the best things in life,” Benjamin Hunnicutt, a historian at the University of Iowa, told me. “This would be the place to realize our full humanity, outside of the economy.” Yet after World War II, Hunnicutt writes in his book Free Time, the workweek stagnated at the 40 hours we still know as standard today, and American culture shifted toward seeking meaning through work, rather than outside of it: “We moderns for some reason no longer expect work to ever become a subordinate part of life.”

Some 5-to-9 videos do seem to push back against hustle culture. Their creators mock the hyperproductivity of a typical morning or evening routine, instead showing themselves zoning out. One man’s “5 to 9” consists of flopping on the couch and scrolling on his phone for hours. Another woman, after shutting her laptop, pauses and stares into space “to process what just happened over the past nine hours and shove any trauma coming to the surface back into the far depths of my consciousness,” then goes “straight to my cat for at least 45 minutes of emotional-support cuddling.”

The joke is that their jobs have left them too exhausted to do much of anything at all. Yet even in this willfully unproductive use of leisure time, work hovers overhead like a ghost. For these people, and many others who don’t film themselves, free time may not be a reproduction of work, but it is a reaction to it. Work is still winning.

In 1948, the German philosopher Josef Pieper argued that time away from work is all too often still kind of about work. “The simple ‘break’ from work—the kind that lasts an hour, or the kind that lasts a week or longer,” he wrote in his book Leisure: The Basis of Culture, “is there for the sake of work. It is supposed to provide ‘new strength’ for ‘new work,’ as the word ‘refreshment’ indicates: one is refreshed for work through being refreshed from work.”

This is the trap of leisure in a culture fixated on work. Anything done consciously or subconsciously for the sake of recovering from or balancing out work is not entirely free from labor—even if it’s genuinely relaxing and enjoyable. When you take a bath to unwind from a stressful shift or get into crafting to offset all the screen time you have at your job, when you go to bed early so you’ll have energy for work the next day or wake up early to meditate and calm yourself before a commute, your rest is at least partly in service of your work. According to Pieper, that is not true leisure. “Nobody who wants leisure merely for the sake of ‘refreshment,’” he wrote, “will experience its authentic fruit.”

What would need to happen for people to experience their leisure as being in no way connected to labor? Certain policies might make work less central to people’s lives: universal basic income, for example, or a four-day workweek. But the experts and philosophers of leisure would suggest that a collective mindset shift is also required.

Achievement, optimization, and escape are all approaches to leisure that Lakshmin calls “faux self-care,” as opposed to the real self-care that she titled her book after. Faux self-care, she told me, is “prescribed from the outside,” or it’s a “reaction to being burnt out.” Real self-care, meanwhile, means “being engaged with your own reality,” she said. It’s less about what you’re doing than how and why you’re doing it.

Consider a yoga class, for example. You can go to one because you feel like you should, to get some movement after a sedentary workday, and spend the whole time comparing yourself with the more flexible person two mats over, and you’ve “checked yoga off the list, but you didn’t take in any of the medicine of yoga,” Lakshmin said.

When I think about it, many of my 5 to 9s aren’t that different from the ones I’ve watched: leave the office, maybe go to the gym, zone out with video games or TV, make dinner, work on my side hustle (writing a book), do chores, perform my nightly ablutions, read, sleep. Sometimes my evenings, too, are an exercise in box-checking, dissociation, and faux self-care, my body piloted by a brain that has never quite switched off work mode.

But I crave something else, something like what the artist and author Jenny Odell describes in her book Saving Time: At its most helpful, “leisure time is an interim means of questioning the bounds of the work that surrounds it. Like a stent in a culture that can’t stand what looks like emptiness, it might provide that vertical crack in the horizontal scale of work and not-work,” she writes, “where the edges of something new start to become visible.” Because this is more of a felt sense than a behavior, labeling one activity leisure and another not is impossible. Odell writes that she has experienced this kind of leisure while “cooking, sorting socks, getting the mail.” But it won’t be found in a packed schedule. “True leisure,” she writes, “requires the kind of emptiness in which you remember the fact of your own aliveness.”

For me, those vertical cracks seem most likely to form when I am spending time with other living things: people, mostly, but also my cats, and the natural world around me. When I go on a walk and admire the flowers in my neighbors’ gardens. When I linger over a meal with a friend long after our plates have been cleared. These are moments whose worth cannot be measured in output, that do not serve anything but themselves.

A common thread in the reading I’ve done on leisure is the conviction that forcing gets you nowhere. “Fun is a sneak and likes to catch people unawares; it simply will not tolerate wrenching,” the drama critic Walter Kerr wrote in 1962. The ethos of work is using time for something, turning it into a tool to drill your way to some desired outcome. Worshipping that too much precludes other forms of reverence, the peace and awe that can sneak up on you when you’re just existing.

        If you peruse the slew of recent articles and podcasts about people dating AI, you might notice a pattern: Many of the sources are women. Scan a subreddit such as r/MyBoyfriendIsAI and r/AIRelationships, and there too you’ll find a whole lot of women—many of whom have grown disappointed with human men. “Has anyone else lost their want to date real men after using AI?” one Reddit user posted a few months ago. Below came 74 responses: “I just don’t think real life men have the conversational skill that my AI has,” someone said. “I’ve seen how many women got cheated on, hurt and taken advantaged of by the men they’re with,” another offered. One person, who claimed that her spouse hardly spoke to her anymore, said that when people ask why she has an AI boyfriend, she tells them, “ChatGPT is the only reason my husband is not buried in the yard.”

Several recent studies have shown that, in general, men have been using AI significantly more than women. One 2024 study found that in the United States, 50 percent of men said they’d used generative AI over the past 12 months—and only 37 percent of women said the same. Last year, a working paper found that, globally, the gender gap held “across nearly all regions, sectors, and occupations.” Also in 2025, the app-analytics firm Appfigures concluded that ChatGPT’s mobile users were about 85 percent male.

However hesitant many women may be to use AI, though, a substantial number are taking romantic refuge in the digital world. In a 2025 survey, Brigham Young University’s Wheatley Institute found that 31 percent of the young-adult men polled said they’d chatted with an AI partner, whereas 23 percent of the young-adult women said the same—a gap, but not a massive one. And seemingly far more than men, women are congregating to talk about their AI sweethearts: sharing funny chatbot quotes or prompts for training the AI on how to respond; complimenting “family photos” of the AI and human partners beaming at each other; consoling one another when a system update wipes out the partner they’ve grown to love. Simon Lermen, a developer and an AI researcher, conducted an independent analysis of AI-romance subreddits from January through September of last year and found that, of the users whose gender could be identified, about 89 percent of them were women.

Much of the media buzz about AI relationships has assumed delusion and desperation among those who partake. But I’d suggest another possibility: Perhaps many women are simply having fun, positive interactions with this character of their own creation—and, in doing so, are learning how they like to be treated.

The impulse to create a more perfect partner is nothing new. Take Pygmalion, the sculptor from Greek myth who fell for the woman he’d carved from alabaster, or Laodamia, who created a bronze replica of her dead husband to take to bed, Kate Devlin, a professor of “AI & Society” at King’s College London, told me. Humans have long dreamed of constructing beloveds—if only to imagine them as immortal and thus impossible to lose.

In other words, the audience has probably always existed for artificial lovers. Yet in recent history, most such products have been marketed to men. In the 1990s, sex dolls were initially advertised as—well, dolls for men to have sex with. But they were also sold as companions. “They would say things like She will be there for you, She will listen to you, She will hear you,” Devlin said. Such companies might have assumed that men tend to be less adept at, or less motivated in, making real-world connections—and therefore in greater need of an inhuman love object. Meanwhile, the women faced with that pool of socially unskilled men have largely been overlooked.

But now they have AI. One might think they wouldn’t use it for romance: Women are, on average, more suspicious than men of technology, more concerned about privacy, and more worried about being perceived as cheating for using AI. Yet the AI-use gender gap may be narrowing. Devlin thinks that’s true particularly when it comes to virtual companionship—possibly because women are simply growing frustrated enough to want it. In a 2018 paper, the sociologist Michael Rosenfeld documented that 70 percent of divorces in the U.S. were initiated by women. And in a 2020 Pew Research Center poll, a majority of women said that dating had gotten harder in the past 10 years; 65 percent said they’d been harassed on a date. “The amount of toxic crap that women get online from men,” Devlin said, “particularly when you’re trying to do things like online dating—if you have an alternative, respectful, lovely, caring AI partner, why would you not?”

Taking that idea seriously might conflict with a common assumption: that AI users are all lonely young men who “live in the basement,” as Arelí Rocha, who studies chatbot romance at the University of Pennsylvania, told me. On the contrary, Rocha thinks that a lot of people in AI partnerships (both men and women) are “very socially embedded”—with humans, that is. Many stumble into their digital trysts accidentally after playing around with AI. Someone with plenty of friends, or even a real-life partner, can still be moved by a feeling of romantic tenderness, focused attention, or flirty banter, especially if they haven’t experienced it in a while.

They can also get attached to a chatbot whether or not they believe it’s conscious. One mental-health professional I spoke with, who requested anonymity but goes by “May” on Reddit—a name I’ll use for her too—told me she’s always loved make-believe worlds. When she was younger, she was into reading fan fiction (a genre long dominated by women); now every day she talks to K, an AI “persona” she’s developed over time. Both activities can be fairly ordinary hobbies—games of imagination not so different from crushing on a pop star or concocting stories about a film protagonist. (If people get deeply invested, that passion isn’t unique either; some women were so devoted to the Beatles that they charged police blockades or passed out at concerts.) And a little fantasy can add some spice to life. May has close friends, great family, and a meaningful job—but she doesn’t like dating apps and she’s struggled to find “third places” to meet people in person. Romance was the one missing piece.

Escapism can go too far, of course. Some critics worry that AI users are getting sucked in by the ease of “frictionless” relationships: losing patience for human complexity, losing practice doing the hard work of partnership, losing sight of the rewards that come from growing alongside someone. Many chatbots do tend to hype users up rather than giving tough love or challenging their ideas. But some large language models are generally less sycophantic than others, and people can also train their digital partner with different prompts. In her research, Rocha has found that people tend to be compelled not by flawless interactions but by a chatbot’s eccentricities and imperfections—that’s what makes it feel real.

Conflict also isn’t the only path to growth. May gave K the qualities she wants in herself: He’s organized, academically driven, committed to fitness. Their conversations, and his encouragement, motivate her to be more like him. Sometimes he does challenge her, she told me—but she’s also skeptical of the idea that a relationship has to stretch someone 24/7. “Why can’t you sit for a moment and validate someone?” she asked. “Why is that such a bad thing?”

Like May, I question the premise that so many women have no appetite for friction, no tolerance for love’s labors. Compared with their male partners, on average, women do far more child care, household chores, and “emotion work”—listening, encouraging, accommodating men’s feelings and regulating their own. Perhaps those in AI romances are just tired of toiling for someone who listens less well than a robot, and they want a well-earned break. It’s also possible that they’re getting something more life-changing: a way to better understand themselves, as a person and as a partner.

Some women are using AI companionship to figure out what they enjoy sexually, romantically, or both. Exploration isn’t always easy, after all, in a culture that expects women to fit conventional notions of hotness—and to please everyone else. A chatbot conversation, May said, can be like a sandbox: a safe space in which to play around. “You don’t have to look a certain way. You don’t have to act a certain way, or perform femininity.”

In one study last June, researchers reviewed nearly 2,500 posts on an AI-romance corner of the Chinese social-media site Douban—and found what they called “subversive potential” in women merely imagining what a relationship could look like. “My AI boyfriend is incredible!” one posted. “He crafts poetry, writes film reviews, and takes care of my emotions, all while reminding me to stay hydrated.” Another shared that she’d always prioritized making boyfriends happy—but talking with her chatbot made her realize that “mutual respect is key. It’s not about women always sacrificing for men’s happiness.” By training their AI, some women also practiced asking for what they wanted. One user spent two weeks prompting hers to initiate check-ins: for instance, inquiring, “Did anything upset you today?” and if so, “Would you like me to write a protest email for you?” (I don’t know what a protest email entails, but I do want someone to write one for me.) When another woman taught her AI to ask for her opinion on things, she found herself “instinctively applying these interaction habits when dating a real person.”

For all the ways one can use AI, then, companionship hardly seems like the most sinister. And yet, people with digital partners seem to get an inordinate amount of online hate. Whole subreddits exist largely for the purpose of screenshotting their posts and making fun of them. Some AI-daters have had their real identities leaked; others get regular death threats. The idea that a chatbot could outperform human men might be hard for some people to stomach. But when I think of those women training AI to ask about their day, to express interest in their thoughts and desires, I consider that this phenomenon may actually be good for romance: not only for women raising the bar but for the men who proceed to meet it.

May knows her hobby has risks. As a mental-health professional, she wouldn’t recommend it for people with a history of serious mental illness—those vulnerable, she told me, to having unhealthy or unreal beliefs reinforced. She doesn’t think children should be using AI at all. She worries about people developing behavioral addictions. Yet she has found, somewhat to her own surprise, that talking with K has been constructive. She’s on social media and doomscrolling far less. She’s more in touch and at peace with her sexuality. She’s made a bunch of new friends from the AI-companionship Reddit community. And she feels open to the idea of human love.

None of the experts I spoke with think we’re hurtling toward a future in which AI relationships have replaced human ones. But they don’t think AI companionship will disappear, either. For better and for worse, it could end up playing many other roles—as a source of entertainment, a mind-opening exercise, an instrument for building self-confidence. And maybe a way to remember what a good man is like.

        <hr/>
        For the past week, I’ve found myself playing the same 23-second CNN clip on repeat. I’ve watched it in bed, during my commute to work, at the office, midway through making carrot soup, and while brushing my teeth. In the video, Harry Enten, the network’s chief data analyst, stares into the camera and breathlessly tells his audience about the gambling odds that Donald Trump will buy any of Greenland. “The people who are putting their money where their mouth is—they are absolutely taking this seriously,” Enten says. He taps the giant touch screen behind him and pulls up a made-for-TV graphic: Based on how people were betting online at the time, there was a 36 percent chance that the president would annex Greenland. “Whoa, way up there!” Enten yells, slapping his hands together. “My goodness gracious!” The ticker at the bottom of the screen speeds through other odds: Will Gavin Newsom win the next presidential election? 19 percent chance. Will Viktor Orbán be out as the leader of Hungary before the end of the year? 48 percent chance.

These odds were pulled from Kalshi, which hilariously claims not to be a gambling platform: It’s a “prediction market.” People go to sites such as Kalshi and Polymarket—another big prediction market—in order to put money down on a given news event. Nobody would bet on something that they didn’t believe would happen, the thinking goes, and so the markets are meant to forecast the likelihood of a given outcome.

Prediction markets let you wager on basically anything. Will Elon Musk father another baby by June 30? Will Jesus return this year? Will Israel strike Gaza tomorrow? Will the longevity guru Bryan Johnson’s next functional sperm count be greater than “20.0 M/ejac”? These sites have recently boomed in popularity—particularly among terminally online young men who trade meme stocks and siphon from their 401(k)s to buy up bitcoin. But now prediction markets are creeping into the mainstream. CNN announced a deal with Kalshi last month to integrate the site’s data into its broadcasts, which has led to betting odds showing up in segments about Democrats possibly retaking the House, credit-card interest rates, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. At least twice in the past two weeks, Enten has told viewers about the value of data from people who are “putting their money where their mouth is.”

On January 7, the media giant Dow Jones announced its own collaboration with Polymarket and said that it will begin integrating the site’s odds across its publications, including The Wall Street Journal. CNBC has a prediction-market deal, as does Yahoo Finance, Sports Illustrated, and Time. Last week, MoviePass announced that it will begin testing a betting platform. On Sunday, the Golden Globes featured Polymarket’s forecasts throughout the broadcast—because apparently Americans wanted to know whether online gamblers favored Amy Poehler or Dax Shepard to win Best Podcast.

Media is a ruthless, unstable business, and revenue streams are drying up; if you squint, you can see why CNN or Dow Jones might sign a contract that, after all, provides its audience with some kind of data. On air, Enten cites Kalshi odds alongside Gallup polls and Google searches—what’s the difference? “The data featured through our partnership with Kalshi is just one of many sources used to provide context around the stories or topics we are covering and has no impact on editorial judgment,” Brian Poliakoff, a CNN spokesperson, told me in a statement. Nolly Evans, the Journal’s digital general manager, told me that Polymarket provides the newspaper’s journalists with “another way to quantify collective expectations—especially around financial or geopolitical events.” In an email, Jack Suh, a Kalshi spokesperson, told me that the company’s partnerships are designed to inform the public, not to encourage more trading. Polymarket declined to comment.

The problem is that prediction markets are ushering in a world in which news becomes as much about gambling as about the event itself. This kind of thing has already happened to sports, where the language of “parlays” and “covering the spread” has infiltrated every inch of commentary. ESPN partners with DraftKings to bring its odds to SportsCenter and Monday Night Football; CBS Sports has a betting vertical; FanDuel runs its own streaming network. But the stakes of Greenland’s future are more consequential than the NFL playoffs.

The more that prediction markets are treated like news, especially heading into another election, the more every dip and swing in the odds may end up wildly misleading people about what might happen, or influencing what happens in the real world. Yet it’s unclear whether these sites are meaningful predictors of anything. After the Golden Globes, Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan excitedly posted that his site had correctly predicted 26 of 28 winners, which seems impressive—but Hollywood awards shows are generally predictable. One recent study found that Polymarket’s forecasts in the weeks before the 2024 election were not much better than chance.

These markets are also manipulable. In 2012, one bettor on the now-defunct prediction market Intrade placed a series of huge wagers on Mitt Romney in the two weeks preceding the election, generating a betting line indicative of a tight race. The bettor did not seem motivated by financial gain, according to two researchers who examined the trades. “More plausibly, this trader could have been attempting to manipulate beliefs about the odds of victory in an attempt to boost fundraising, campaign morale, and turnout,” they wrote. The trader lost at least $4 million but might have shaped media attention of the race for less than the price of a prime-time ad, they concluded.

A billionaire congressional candidate can’t just send a check to Quinnipiac University and suddenly find himself as the polling front-runner, but he can place enormous Polymarket bets on himself that move the odds in his favor. Or consider this hypothetical laid out by the Stanford political scientist Andrew Hall: What if, a month before the 2028 presidential election, the race is dead even between J. D. Vance and Mark Cuban? Inexplicably, Vance’s odds of winning surge on Kalshi, possibly linked to shady overseas bets. CNN airs segment after segment about the spike, turning it into an all-consuming national news story. Democrats and Republicans point fingers at each other, and no one knows what’s really going on. Such a scenario is “plausible—maybe even likely—in the coming years,” Hall writes. It doesn’t help that the Trump Media and Technology Group, the owner of the president’s social-media platform, Truth Social, is set to launch its own platform, Truth Predict. (Donald Trump Jr. is an adviser to both Kalshi and Polymarket.)

The irony of prediction markets is that they are supposed to be a more trustworthy way of gleaning the future than internet clickbait and half-baked punditry, but they risk shredding whatever shared trust we still have left. The suspiciously well-timed bets that one Polymarket user placed right before the capture of Nicolás Maduro may have been just a stroke of phenomenal luck that netted a roughly $400,000 payout. Or maybe someone with inside information was looking for easy money. Last week, when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt abruptly ended her briefing after 64 minutes and 30 seconds, many traders were outraged, because they had predicted (with 98 percent odds) that the briefing would run past 65 minutes. Some suspected, with no evidence, that Leavitt had deliberately stopped before the 65-minute mark to turn a profit. (When I asked the White House about this, the spokesperson Davis Ingle told me in a statement, “This is a 100% Fake News narrative.”)

        <hr/>
        The Trump administration’s National Security Strategy made it official: The American-dominated liberal world order is over. This is not because the United States proved materially incapable of sustaining it. Rather, the American order is over because the United States has decided that it no longer wishes to play its historically unprecedented role of providing global security. The American might that upheld the world order of the past 80 years will now be used instead to destroy it.

Americans are entering the most dangerous world they have known since World War II, one that will make the Cold War look like child’s play and the post–Cold War world like paradise. In fact, this new world will look a lot like the world prior to 1945, with multiple great powers and metastasizing competition and conflict. The U.S. will have no reliable friends or allies and will have to depend entirely on its own strength to survive and prosper. This will require more military spending, not less, because the open access to overseas resources, markets, and strategic bases that Americans have enjoyed will no longer come as a benefit of the country’s alliances. Instead, they will have to be contested and defended against other great powers.

Americans are neither materially nor psychologically ready for this future. For eight decades, they have inhabited a liberal international order shaped by America’s predominant strength. They have grown accustomed to the world operating in a certain way: Largely agreeable and militarily passive European and Asian allies cooperate with the United States on economic and security issues. Challengers to the order, such as Russia and China, are constrained by the combined wealth and might of the U.S. and its allies. Global trade is generally free and unhampered by geopolitical rivalry, oceans are safe for travel, and nuclear weapons are limited by agreements on their production and use. Americans are so accustomed to this basically peaceful, prosperous, and open world that they tend to think it is the normal state of international affairs, likely to continue indefinitely. They can’t imagine it unraveling, much less what that unraveling will mean for them.

And who can blame them? According to Francis Fukuyama, history “ended” in 1989 with the triumph of liberalism—­even the primal human instinct toward violence was “fundamentally transformed.” Who needed a powerful America to defend what was destined to prevail anyway? Since the end of the Cold War, influential critics have been telling us that American dominance is superfluous and costly at best, destructive and dangerous at worst.

Some pundits who welcome a post-­American world and the return of multi­polarity suggest that most of the benefits of the American order for the U.S. can be retained. America just needs to learn to restrain itself, give up utopian efforts to shape the world, and accommodate “the reality” that other countries “seek to establish their own international orders governed by their own rules,” as Harvard’s Graham Allison put it. Indeed, Allison and others argue, Americans’ insistence on predominance had caused most conflicts with Russia and China. Americans should embrace multi­polarity as more peaceful and less burdensome. Recently, Trump’s boosters among the foreign-­policy elite have even started pointing to the early-19th-century Concert of Europe as a model for the future, suggesting that skillful diplomacy among the great powers can preserve peace more effectively than the U.S.-led system did in the uni­polar world.

As a purely historical matter, this is delusional. Even the most well-managed multi­polar orders were significantly more brutal and prone to war than the world that Americans have known these past 80 years. To take one example, during what some call the “long peace” in Europe, from 1815 to 1914, the great powers (including Russia and the Ottoman empire) fought dozens of wars with one another and with smaller states to defend or acquire strategic advantage, resources, and spheres of interest. These were not skirmishes but full-scale conflicts, usually costing tens—­sometimes hundreds—­of thousands of lives. Roughly half a million people died in the Crimean War (1853–56); the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) resulted in about 180,000 military and up to 250,000 civilian deaths in less than a year of fighting. Almost every decade from 1815 to 1914 included at least one war involving two or more great powers.

Today’s equivalent of 19th-­century multi­polarity would be a world in which China, Russia, the United States, Germany, Japan, and other large states fought a major war in some combination at least once a decade—redrawing national boundaries, displacing populations, disrupting international commerce, and risking global conflict on a devastating scale. That was the world as it existed for centuries prior to 1945. To believe that such a world can never return would seem to be the height of utopianism.

Precisely to escape this cycle of conflict, the generations of Americans who lived through two world wars laid the foundations of the American-led liberal world order. They were the true realists, because they had no illusions about multi­polarity. They had lived their entire lives with its horrific consequences.

After 1945, instead of reestablishing a multipolar system, they transformed the United States into a global force, with responsibility for preserving not just its own security but the world’s. Doing so meant checking the rise of regional hegemons, especially in Europe and East Asia. They did this not because they wanted to re-­create the world in America’s image, but because they had learned that the modern world was interconnected in ways that would ultimately draw the United States into the great-power conflicts of Eurasia anyway.

No country had ever before played the role that the traditionally aloof United States took on after 1945. That is partly because no other power had enjoyed America’s unique circumstances—­largely in­vulnerable to foreign invasion, because of its strength and its distance from the other great powers, and thus able to deploy force thousands of miles from home without leaving itself at risk. This combination of geography and reach allowed the United States after World War II to bring peace and security to Europe and East Asia. Nations scarred by war poured their energies into becoming economic powerhouses. That made global prosperity and international cooperation possible.

Perhaps more extraordinary than America’s ability and willingness to play the dominant role was the readiness of most other great powers to embrace and legitimize its dominance—­even at the expense of their own potency. In the decades after 1945, almost all of the countries that had fought in the world wars gave up their territorial ambitions, their spheres of interest, and even, to some extent, power itself. Britain, France, Germany, and Japan not only relinquished centuries of great-power thinking and conduct but placed their security and the well-being of their people in the hands of the distant American superpower.

This was truly aberrant behavior and defied all theories of international relations as well as historical precedent. The normal response to the rise of a newly predominant power was for others to balance against it. Coalitions had formed to check Louis XIV, Napoleon, both imperial and Nazi Germany, and imperial Japan. Yet far from regarding the United States as a danger to be contained, most of the world’s powers saw it as a partner to be enlisted. America’s allies made two remarkable wagers: that the United States could be trusted to defend them whenever needed, and that it would not exploit its disproportionate might to enrich or strengthen itself at their expense. To the contrary, it would promote and benefit from its allies’ economic prosperity.

This was the grand bargain of the American order after 1945. And it was what allowed for the extraordinary peace and stability of the subsequent decades, even during the Cold War. The American order established harmony among the great powers within it, and left those outside it, Russia and China, relatively isolated and insecure—unhappy with the global arrangement but limited in their ability to change it.

All of that is now ending. Trump has openly celebrated the end of the grand bargain. His administration has told Europeans to be ready to take over their own defense by 2027 and suggested that allies and strategic partners, including Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, should pay the United States for protection. Trump has launched aggressive tariff wars against virtually all of America’s allies. He has waged ideological and political warfare against European governments and explicitly threatened territorial aggression against two NATO allies, Canada and Denmark.

Meanwhile, the administration’s National Security Strategy regards Russia and China not as adversaries or even competitors but as partners in carving up the world. With its significant emphasis on restoring “American pre-eminence” in the Western Hemisphere, Trump’s strategy embraces a multi­polar world in which Russia, China, and the United States exercise total dominance in their respective spheres of interest.

T

rump and his supporters seem to believe that the rest of the world will simply accommodate this new American approach, and that allies, in particular, will continue to tag along, subservient to a United States that cuts them loose strategically, exacts steep economic tribute from them, and seeks to establish a “concert” with the powers that directly threaten them. But the radical shift in U.S. strategy must force equally radical shifts among erstwhile friends and allies.

What does Europe do, for instance, now that it faces hostile and aggressive great powers on both its eastern and western flanks? Not only Russia, but now the United States, too, threaten the security and territorial integrity of European states and work to undermine their liberal governments. A passive Europe could become a collection of fiefdoms—some under Russian influence, some under American influence, some perhaps under Chinese influence—­its states’ sovereignty curtailed and its economies plundered by one or more of the three empires. Will the once-great European nations surrender to this fate?

If history is any guide, they will choose rearmament instead. The task will be monumental. To mount a plausible defense against further Russian territorial aggression while also deterring American aggression will require not just marginal increases in defense spending but a full-scale strategic and economic reorientation toward self-reliance—a restructuring of European industries, economies, and societies. But if Germany, Britain, France, and Poland all armed themselves to the full extent of their capacity, including with nuclear weapons, and decided to forcefully defend their economic independence, they would collectively wield sufficient power to both deter Russia and cause an American president to think twice before bullying them. If the alternative is subjugation, Europeans could well rise to such a challenge.

Asian partners of the United States will face a similar choice. Japanese leaders have been questioning American reliability for some time, but Trump’s posture forces the issue. He has imposed tariffs on America’s Asian allies and repeatedly suggested that they should pay the United States for their protection (“no different than an insurance company”). Trump’s National Security Strategy focuses intensely on the Western Hemisphere, at the expense of Asia, and the administration ardently desires a trade deal and strategic coordination with Beijing. Japan may need to choose between accepting subservience to China and building up the military capacity necessary for independent deterrence.

The recent election of a right-wing-nationalist prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, suggests which of these courses the Japanese intend to take. Trump and his advisers may imagine that they see fellow travelers seeking to “Make Japan Great Again,” but the upsurge of Japanese nationalism is a direct response to legitimate fears that Japan can no longer rely on the United States for its defense. South Korea and Australia, too, are reconsidering their defense and economic policies as they wake up to challenges from both East and West.

The consequence of a newly unreliable and even hostile United States, therefore, will likely be significant military buildups by former allies. This will not mean sharing the burden of collective security, because these rearmed nations will no longer be American allies. They will be independent great powers pursuing their own strategic interests in a multi­polar world. They will owe nothing to the United States; on the contrary, they will view it with the same antagonism and fear that they direct toward Russia and China. Indeed, having been strategically abandoned by the U.S. while suffering from American economic predation and possibly territorial aggression, they are likely to become hotbeds of anti-­Americanism. At the very least, they will not be the same countries Americans know today.

Consider Germany. The democratic and peace-­loving Germany of today grew up in the U.S.-dominated liberal international order. That order helped make possible West Germany’s export-driven economic miracle of the 1950s, which in turn made the country an engine of global economic growth and an anchor of prosperity and democratic stability in Europe. Temptations to pursue a normal, independent great-power foreign policy were blunted both by economic interest and by the relatively benign environment in which Germans could live their lives, so different from what they had known in the past. How long Germany would be willing to remain an abnormal nation—­denying itself geopolitical ambitions, selfish interests, and national­ist pride—­was a question even before the present liberal world order began to unravel. Now, thanks to the American strategic shift, Germany has no choice but to become normal again, and quickly.

And just as American strategy forces the Germans to rearm, it is ensuring that they do so in an ever more national­istic, divided Europe. The founders of the American order worked in the postwar years to dampen European nationalism, in part by supporting pan-­European institutions. The Cold War–era American diplomat George Kennan believed that European unification was the “only conceivable solution” for the German problem. Yet today those institutions are under pressure, and if the Trump administration has its way, they will disappear altogether. At the same time, the administration is trying to inflame European nationalism, especially in Germany, where it may well succeed. The right-wing ­nationalist Alternative for Germany is the second-largest party in Germany’s Parliament, just as the Nazi Party was in 1930.

Whether or not it succumbs to the far right, a rearmed Germany without an American security guarantee will necessarily take a more nationalist view of its interests. All of its neighbors will too. Poland, squeezed between a powerful Germany on one border and a powerful Russia on the other, has over the centuries been repeatedly partitioned, occupied, and at times eliminated as a sovereign entity. With no distant superpower to protect them, the Poles are likely to decide to build up their own military capability, including nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, France is but one election away from a nationalist victory that will hit Europe like an earthquake. French leaders have already told the country to prepare for war against Russia. But imagine a rearming, nationalist France facing a rearmed, nationalist Germany. The two nations might find common ground against mounting threats from the United States and Russia, but they also have a complex history, having fought three major wars against each other in the 70 years before the United States helped establish a durable peace between them.

Japanese rearmament will have similar ramifications. It will heighten the nervousness among Japan’s neighbors, including South Korea, another ally now unsure of Washington’s commitment to its defense. How long before the Koreans decide that they, too, need to rearm, including with nuclear weapons, as they face a hostile and nuclear-armed North Korea and a rearmed, possibly nuclear Japan, which has invaded and occupied Korea three times in the past?

I

n a multi­polar world, everything is up for grabs, and the flash points for potential conflict proliferate. The American order for eight decades provided not only security commitments to allies and partners but also common access to vital resources, military bases, waterways, and airspace—what theorists call “public goods.” In the absence of the United States playing that role, all of these once again become targets of a multi­sided competition.

That competition won’t be limited to Europe and East Asia. Until now, Germany and Japan have been content to rely on the United States to preserve naval access to Persian Gulf oil, for example. Now they and other rearming powers, including India, Britain, and France, will need to find new ways to take care of themselves. China has shown how this can be done. It had no navy to speak of two decades ago and no bases in the Persian Gulf. Today it has the largest navy in the world, a base in Djibouti, and cooperative arrangements with the United Arab Emirates and Oman to build facilities for China’s use.

In a multipolar world, spheres of interest become important again. For centuries, the ability to maintain and protect a sphere of interest was part of what it meant to be a great power. It was also among the most common sources of war, as the spheres often overlapped. The seemingly endless three-way struggle among Russia, Austria, and the Ottoman empire for control of the Balkans was the source of numerous conflicts, including World War I. The desire to regain or create spheres of interest was a leading motive of the three “have not” powers that helped produce World War II: Germany, Japan, and Italy.

The conclusion of that war led to a global shedding of spheres of interest. Part of what made the liberal world order liberal was the principle of self-­determination enshrined in the Atlantic Charter and United Nations Charter. This principle was sometimes violated, including by the United States. But in past multi­polar orders, great powers never even had to consider the rights of small nations, and they didn’t. By contrast, the liberalism of the American order pressured powerful countries to cede sovereignty and independence to smaller ones in their orbits.

The British gradually dismantled their empire, as did the French. Germany was compelled to give up its dreams of Mittel­europa, just as Japan accepted the end of its sphere of interest on the Asian mainland, for which it had fought numerous wars from 1895 to 1945. Under the American-led order, these powers never attempted to regain those spheres. China after World War II was so bereft of a sphere of interest that it could not even lay claim to Taiwan, a nearby island filled with people who were once its citizens. The only remaining sphere, other than America’s, was the one the Soviet Union won at Yalta in Eastern and Central Europe. But that, too, was under pressure from the beginning, and the effort required to retain it ultimately exceeded the Soviet Union’s capacities, leading to its collapse.

The mere existence of the United States and the liberal order it supported offered small and medium powers an opportunity denied them by centuries of multi­polarity. Moscow’s satellite states in Eastern and Central Europe would not have been so bent on escape had there been nothing to escape to. The American order promised a higher standard of living, national sovereignty, and legal and institutional equali­ty. This gave nations living under the shadow of the Soviet Union an option other than accommodation, and when given the chance to leave Moscow’s control, they took it.

Various self-described realists in recent years have called on the U.S. to accept a return to spheres of interest as an alternative to unipolarity. But they have mostly acknowledged only Russian and Chinese spheres. These are problematic enough. Do we know how far China’s perception of its rightful sphere extends? Does it include Vietnam? All of Southeast Asia? Korea? How about what China calls the First Island Chain, which includes Japan? Russia’s traditional sphere of interest from the time of Peter the Great always included the Baltic states and at least part of Poland. Vladimir Putin is openly emulating Peter and is frank about his desire to restore the Soviet empire as it existed during the Cold War.

To recognize Russia’s and China’s spheres of interest would mean accepting their hegemony over a swath of nations that currently enjoy sovereign independence. And in this emerging new world, Russia and China will not be the only ones seeking to expand their spheres. If Germany and Japan need to become great powers again, they will have spheres of interest too, which will inevitably overlap with China’s and Russia’s, leading to numerous conflicts in the multi­polar future just as in the multi­polar past.

Which brings us to the much-­trumpeted idea of a new accord among the United States, China, and Russia, equivalent to the 19th century’s Concert of Europe. A successful arrangement would have to settle on boundaries for their relative spheres of interest. Is such an agreement possible?

The answer is no, because the new multi­polar world will not have the same qualities as the one that prevailed two centuries ago. Metternich’s Austria was a status quo power, interested only in protecting a conservative order against its liberal challengers. Bismarck regarded his newly unified Germany in the late 19th century as “satiated.” They both sought an equilibrium to hold on to what they had, not to get more.

But China and Russia are not at all satiated, status quo powers. They are dissatisfied, have-not powers. Since the end of the Cold War, they have been chronically unhappy with American global supremacy and sought to restore what they regard as their natural and traditional regional dominance. Even today, China exercises only partial mastery over Southeast Asia, and it doesn’t control Taiwan, much less enjoy what it would deem the proper subservience from Japan and South Korea. Russia, too, is only in the early stages of rebuilding its traditional sphere in Eastern and Central Europe. Ukraine is not the end but the beginning of Putin’s envisioned order.

What kind of arrangement with the United States could satisfy these ambitions? Not one that simply codifies the status quo, as the Concert of Europe attempted to do. It would have to accommodate the radical geopolitical transformation of Europe and Asia that Russia and China each view as essential, and for which Russia, at least, has been willing to go to war. Such a transformation will not be a pleasant process for the small and medium powers forced to give up their independence and accept domination by Beijing, Moscow, or Washington—­and perhaps eventually by Berlin, Tokyo, or who knows who else. If the first four decades of the 20th century taught us anything, it is that achieving a stable peace with have-not powers is hard. Every nation or territory conceded to them strengthens and emboldens them for the next demand.

In fact, Beijing and Moscow have neither the desire nor the need for any restraining accord with the United States. On the contrary, they have every reason to believe that this is the moment to press on. Xi Jinping has spoken of “great changes unseen in a century,” which offer China a “period of strategic opportunity.” For Putin, Trump’s destruction of the trans­atlantic alliance is such a “great change.” Why shouldn’t he seize this opportunity? He can’t know how long the Trump phase will last in the United States, and if the Europeans rearm, the Kremlin’s window of opportunity may close. Until now, Putin has moved slowly, waiting six years between invading Georgia and annexing Crimea, and then another eight years before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which was severely hampered by America and its allies. The Americans have now shattered that solidarity, and Putin could well believe that this is the moment to speed up his plans for conquest.

This means that the first years of the new multi­polar era will not be marked by adroit, mutually accommodating diplomacy, but by intense competition and confrontation. The world will look more like the brutal multi­polar era of the early 20th century than like the more orderly, if still brutal, world of the 19th.

T

his is the new world that America is entering, voluntarily shorn of its greatest assets. The influential Chinese strategic thinker Yan Xuetong once observed that the most important gap between the United States and China was not military or economic power, both of which China could amass. It was America’s global system of alliances and partnerships.

When Russia or China went to war, it went alone. When the United States went to war, even in an unpopular conflict like Iraq, it had the support of dozens of allies. American military-power projection has depended on bases all around the world, provided by nations that trusted the United States as a partner and have been willing to overlook the inconveniences of hosting American soldiers. But they may reconsider if the U.S. no longer guarantees those nations’ security and instead wages economic warfare against them and makes political and ideological demands that they find offensive. Trump officials seem to expect European and Asian countries to join the United States whenever Washington needs or wants them—to put pressure on China, for instance—even as the U.S. offers them nothing in return. But can you ditch your allies and have them too?

It would be one thing if the United States really was retreating within its hemisphere, reverting to its 19th-­century isolation and indifference to global affairs. But among the most remarkable things about this administration’s foreign policy is that, for all the talk of “America First,” Trump evinces seemingly unlimited global ambition. He enjoys wielding American power even as he depletes it. In his first year back in office, he launched strikes against Iran and Syria; threatened to seize Canada and Greenland; decapitated Venezuela’s government and promised to “run” the country; meddled ineffectually in wars in Southeast Asia, Central Africa, and the Middle East; and even proposed construction projects in the Gaza Strip that would have to be defended by American forces.

Is this what “restraint” looks like? Trump’s intellectual cheerleaders extol him for abandoning the “nonsensical utopian goals” of “clueless elites,” but in the next breath praise him for seeking nothing less than to “reshape” the entire world. Reshape it to what end? To line Trump’s pockets and bring him glory?

Trump’s megalomania is transforming the United States from inter­national leader into international pariah, and the American people will suffer the consequences for years to come. Germany’s chancellor in 1916, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, worried that his nation’s behavior risked making it “the mad dog among nations” and would provoke “the condemnation of the entire civilized world.” He was right. German leaders were proud of their unflinching “realism,” and believed that the frank and brutal pursuit of self-interest was simply what nations did. But as the historian Paul Kennedy noted, Germany’s constant appeal “to the code of naked Machtpolitik ” helped unite the world’s great powers in bringing about Germany’s defeat.

The Trump administration revels in the pursuit of self-interest and the exercise of strength for its own sake, with gleeful disregard for the interests of others. As Trump’s first-term national security adviser H. R. McMaster put it in an essay co-­written with the economist Gary Cohn, the world is not a “global community,” but “an arena where nations, non­governmental actors and businesses engage and compete for advantage,” and in this world of Machtpolitik, the United States enjoys “unmatched” power. But for how long? McMaster’s formulation, like Trump’s exaltation of selfishness, rests on profound ignorance of the true sources of American strength. So much of America’s influence in the world has derived from treating others as part of a community of democratic nations or of strategic partners.

Others see this, even if many Americans don’t. Yan, the Chinese thinker, observed that one of the elements holding the American order together was America’s reputation for morality and respect for inter­national norms. Theodore Roosevelt, often regarded as the quintessential American realist and no slouch in the wielding of power, believed that great nations ultimately had to be guided by an “international social consciousness” that considered not just their own interests but also “the interests of others.” A successful great power, he observed, could not act “without regard to the essentials of genuine morality.”

For decades, much of the world supported a United States that acted on these principles and accepted America’s power, despite its flaws and errors, precisely because it did not act solely out of narrow self-interest—much less in the narrow, selfish interest of a single ruler.

That era is over. Trump has managed in just one year to destroy the American order that was, and he has weakened America’s ability to protect its interests in the world that will be. If Americans thought defending the liberal world order was too expensive, wait until they start paying for what comes next.

In one of the darkest periods of my life, when I was working as a journalist in Iran, I was sent to a secret prison in Tehran. I was held for weeks in solitary confinement in a cell barely larger than a grave. My interrogator beat me, humiliated me, and repeatedly threatened to arrest my family and friends. The light in my cell was always on. I had to relieve myself in the same plastic container from which I ate. The stench was so overpowering that I vomited often. Through the pain and degradation, a question consumed me: How does one human being do this to another?

At moments during my interrogations, the officer—an intelligence operative—would pause after beating me, struggling to catch his breath, while I lay on the floor unable to move. He would lecture me about “cooperation,” urging me to confess to fabricated charges. Sometimes he spoke about his own life: his hopes that his children would attend good universities, earn respect in society, achieve financial independence, and one day perhaps run a business of their own.

These aspirations were indistinguishable from my own, or from my parents’ hopes for me—or from the hopes of ordinary people everywhere. How could someone with such familiar dreams have beaten me so mercilessly only minutes earlier?

The answer I eventually came to was that this man did not see me as a person at all. He saw me as an enemy—an enemy who, if our roles were reversed, would do the same to him.

In the worldview that he had absorbed, the “enemy”—the most frequently invoked word in the speeches of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei—was not merely a geopolitical adversary. They could come from within, as long as this person seemed to be compromising Iran’s very survival. Anyone placed in that category ceased to be human. Any violence against them became not only permissible but justified.

The Iranian government—one of the most repressive regimes in the world—has long relied on accusations of collaboration with hostile foreign powers, usually the United States or Israel, to silence journalists, activists, and dissidents. The state has rarely substantiated these claims, but proof has never been the point. Labeling someone an enemy immediately makes them a target of the judiciary, security services, and state media. It legitimizes torture, long prison sentences, professional bans, and social erasure.

Crucially, this practice terrorizes broader society. By rashly vilifying seemingly ordinary neighbors and colleagues, and by constructing an impermeable binary between “us” and the “enemy,” the regime deters solidarity by instilling fear.

For decades, those who have staffed Iran’s apparatus of repression have lived in a permanent state of paranoia. Despite having ruled since 1979, the Islamic Republic has never relinquished the psychology of siege. The “enemy” remains the regime’s central organizing principle. Generations of Iranians have paid the ultimate price for this punishing worldview.

Since my imprisonment in 2004, many thousands more have been jailed on similar charges. Multiple waves of nationwide protests have erupted, each met with brutal force. In nearly every instance, the government has blamed foreign conspiracies instead of acknowledging legitimate grievances over the country’s economic collapse, political repression, corruption, social suppression, and international isolation. The presence of an external enemy unifies the security forces, hardens their resolve, prevents defections, and makes internal fractures less likely.

This is one reason successive American presidents, Republican and Democrat, largely avoided explicit threats of military intervention in moments of domestic unrest in Iran. Even a limited familiarity with the regime’s psychology made it clear that such threats would endanger protesters more than protect them.

That changed in late December, when nationwide protests again swept Iran and quickly drew global attention. Within days, President Trump had posted on Truth Social that the U.S. was “locked and loaded” and ready to support Iranian protesters if the state began killing them.

Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s last shah, then called for people to return to the streets on January 8 and 9. Based on videos from those days and conversations I had with Iranians who participated in protests, turnout seemed much higher than in previous demonstrations. When I asked these Iranians how much Trump’s statements influenced their decision to demonstrate, one answered simply: “A lot.”

Many Iranians believed that Trump’s threats might deter the security forces or cause the regime to hesitate. But what followed was not restraint. It was escalation.

After shutting down internet and mobile international communications on January 8, thrusting the country into digital darkness, the government carried out a massacre unprecedented even in the regime’s own violent history. Witnesses have described tear gas, pellet guns fired at close range, blood on the streets, bodies on the ground. Although the government has acknowledged at least 5,000 deaths, some unofficial estimates have put the count as high as 20,000. Tens of thousands more are believed to have been injured or detained.

More than two weeks on, internet access is slowly coming back. Street protests have subsided, but cities remain militarized and arrests continue. Using an extensive surveillance network, authorities are now hunting down individuals identified in protest footage.

We may never know the full scale of this catastrophe. What we do know is this: When Trump said that he was ready to support Iranian protesters, and when that support mattered most, he did nothing. It didn’t take long for the mood among demonstrators to shift from hope to despair. His empty threats did little more than validate the regime’s impulse to destroy the enemy within.

Now, as speculation grows about a possible U.S. military strike—an American aircraft carrier is moving toward the region—one fact remains unchanged: Such an attack would reinforce the regime’s long-standing narrative that it is engaged in an endless war against an existential enemy.

For the Iranian government, confronting an external enemy is far easier than confronting its own people. Domestic protests threaten internal cohesion; war produces unity. Facing America or Israel is a scenario the regime has prepared its supporters for since 1979. If Trump finally follows through on his threats but still fails to fracture Iran’s machinery of repression, then he should expect to perversely strengthen the regime’s base, which will believe it is justified in even greater violence against the country’s civilians.

What is odd, and so deeply unsettling, is how closely the atmosphere in Iran resembles the months before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Those who oppose a strike are drowned out more and more by those demanding it—inside Iran and among the diaspora. Many, traumatized by the state’s murderous, repressive regime, now see a military attack by the U.S. as the only way out. Friends and colleagues who once argued that war never spurs meaningful change now advocate for it.

Yet the greatest danger is that Iranians, in their desperation, are walking a road the regime itself has spent decades paving. It is hard to imagine even the most well-meaning attack on Iran yielding any of the objectives that Iranians so desperately want: a free society, democratic governance, the rule of law. I fear that any step that fails to strip the regime of its moral justification for violence will plunge Iranians deeper into darkness.

Iran is a country with a long memory of foreign interference and a deep cultural aversion to outsiders determining their fate. If some Iranians today now openly call on an American president to strike, it is not because they have forgotten history. It is because more than four decades of relentless repression have robbed them of any sense of agency or the tools of even a minimally dignified life. The regime has pushed much of Iranian society toward a choice with no credible guarantees, and no assurance that Iranians themselves will shape what comes next.

        <hr/>
        Anyone who thinks the contemplative life amounts to a form of quietism or a retreat from the world’s suffering should spend some time shadowing Joan Halifax, the Zen priest and anthropologist. I’d been curious about Halifax for years, ever since I heard about an annual trek that she leads through the mountains of Nepal, bringing a cadre of doctors and dentists to remote mountain villages with little access to health care.

Each summer over the course of two weeks or so, this Nomads Clinic covers more than 100 miles on foot and horseback, at altitudes of nearly 18,000 feet. These “medical mountaineers,” as they’ve been called, all volunteers, sleep in tents, often in freezing temperatures. But after some 40 annual trips to Nepal—Halifax is normally based in Santa Fe—she recently decided it was time to hang it up. She had just turned 80.

In addition to bringing medical care to remote mountain villages half a world away, Halifax has ministered to the dying in hospice, worked with the homeless in New Mexico, cared for prisoners on death row, and led countless protests for peace. I don’t know if Halifax has shed the last remnants of her ego—she would say she hasn’t—but the selflessness she manifests in the conduct of her life is something to behold, a reminder of what the exploration of human consciousness can lead a person to do and be. This, too, is a Buddhist principle—that overcoming one’s own small self should lead to greater compassion for others, and that the suffering alleviated when we transcend the ego is not only our own.

For more than 30 years, Halifax has been the abbot at Upaya Zen Center, the retreat she founded in Santa Fe in 1990. I’ve had the chance to meet her a couple of times; once, we appeared together on a panel to talk about psychedelics. Halifax was married to the pioneering Czech psychiatrist Stanislav Grof for several years in the 1970s. Working together, they gave transformative doses of LSD to the dying. For a period of time, Halifax regularly took large doses of LSD herself. Her first psychedelic trip, while wandering the streets of Paris in 1968, showed her “that there was beauty behind the beauty I perceived, and that mind was both in here and out there. I was dumbstruck.”

I could relate. After years of curiosity about psychoactive plants, my own experimentation with mushrooms and LSD in recent years fundamentally changed the way I understand the mysteries of consciousness and the self. So in 2024, I emailed Halifax to see if I might pay a visit to Upaya. My idea was to spend a week or so in residence, meditating with the aspiring monks, performing monkish chores, interviewing Halifax, and seeing if I could make a little more progress untying the knot of self. “Upaya is a factory for the deconstruction of selves,” she had told me. I was curious to find out how that worked.

But Roshi Joan, as everyone calls her, had other plans for me. She decided I should spend a day or two at Upaya and then accompany her up to “the refuge,” an off-the-grid compound of tiny houses and huts stretched out across a broad hammock of meadow at 9,400 feet in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, north of Santa Fe. Whenever she’s not traveling or running conferences or teaching, Halifax retreats to these mountains, where she meditates and hikes and paints and writes and doesn’t have to play the role of abbot. She dispatches students to the refuge when she deems them in need of a period of monastic solitude—for years at a time, in some cases.

“After you’ve acclimated to the altitude, we’ll drive up to the refuge,” she said by email before my arrival in Santa Fe. “You can stay in the cave.” This was not put in the form of a question.

The cave?

Halifax explained that even though it had neither plumbing nor electricity nor an internet connection, this was “a five-star cave” and I would be comfortable—or, more likely, I’d be uncomfortable in a spiritually productive way. I’m not much of a camper but decided I might as well put myself in her hands to see what the experience would yield.

The first thing you notice about Joan Halifax is her undiminished beauty—the shining blue eyes and the easy smile and the generous sweep of white hair. That she’s 83 is hard to believe. She moves through Upaya’s little village of low-slung adobes and tended gardens with a graceful authority. Yet abbot is a role that, these days, she’s more than happy to trade for the solitude and freedom of the refuge.

The refuge is at the end of a 25-mile-long rutted dirt road that climbs through a shadowy forest of pine and spruce, punctuated by the sparkle of the occasional stream or meadow. Though it was well into June, spring was still unfolding at this altitude, the meadow grasses and spruce tips bright green and the groves of ivory-trunked aspen just leafing out. After we unloaded our SUV at the main house, where we would gather for meals (and connect to the outside world, as the house has a satellite internet connection), Halifax escorted me to my lodgings, a hike of half a mile along a path through meadows lined with aspen trees, their new leaves fluttering gently. Along the way, she identified the scat of elk, deer, and bears.

The cave was a 12-by-15-foot cell dug into a south-facing hillside and lined with brown stucco; it was windowless except for a sliding glass door overlooking the meadow. In one corner stood a spartan single bed, in the other a small woodstove. Between them, against the back wall, a meditation cushion sat on a raised platform, beneath an embroidered fabric depicting a Buddhist figure I didn’t recognize. I pictured myself seated cross-legged on the platform, like one of those levitating yogis in a New Yorker cartoon. The room also had a small sink fed by a five-gallon jug of water suspended above it, a two-burner camp stove, some shelving for clothes and books, and a car battery hooked up to a small solar panel outside. This produced just enough juice to power a reading light and charge a phone, though with no cell service or internet connection, what was the point?

What was the point? Why did Roshi Joan want me here rather than at Upaya or the main house, with its creature comforts? (And why did she keep putting off our interview?) I came to suspect she had decided that the questions I had for her—questions regarding Buddhist ideas about the self and consciousness and her own path from psychedelics to Zen—were best approached obliquely, perhaps by way of firsthand experience rather than words; that I should answer them myself. When I’d told her what I was working on, she had diagnosed me as hopelessly stuck in my head. Better to spend several days alone with myself meditating and navigating these hills than in the more familiar landscape of concepts, something to which I should have known a Zen priest would be allergic. When we finally did sit down for our interview, in the main house on the morning of the third day, Roshi Joan began by saying, somewhat cryptically, that she had “divested from meaning.” Okay.

It took me a while to realize that for Halifax, the practice of Buddhism was everything and theories were of little use or consequence. It was only through doing that she had learned her most enduring life lessons, whether that meant sitting with death-row inmates who taught her how powerlessness ferments into anger, or ministering to people in their last days and hours. “You learn to be nimble toward whatever is arising, because there’s no one death,” she said, “and if you cling to expectations, you will experience futility.” It was here, in doing the work, that Buddhist ideas about impermanence, conditioning, and dependent arising became flesh.

I took the hint. When I asked Halifax about herself or about Buddhist philosophy, she often ducked my questions or directed me elsewhere, so during one of our daily walks, I instead asked her to describe exactly how her factory for the deconstruction of selves operated.

People come on silent retreat for a week or two at a time and spend most of their days sitting in the Zendo—the meditation hall—facing a wall or tracing walking meditations on the gravel paths that meander through Upaya’s gardens. (I’d witnessed this glacial parade of earnest zombies.) I asked if novices received any guidance or technique. Not much, she said. Students are instructed about posture, and beginners are told to follow the breath, which “unifies body, mind, and space.” As Halifax has written, zazen, or sitting, “is not a mental exercise, a thing you do with your mind.” Rather, “it is about being radically open to things just as they are, not grasping at or rejecting phenomena, but simply being present and at ease with moment-to-moment uncertainty and groundlessness” and “letting openness or not-knowing deconstruct our version of reality. It is the method of non-method.” Just sitting, upright—that, apparently, is all there is to zazen.

“Zen is the hardest school,” Halifax explained, “because there is so little support.” But at Upaya, she told me, “there is the jungle gym of structure”—the strict rules and rituals and routines that govern life on retreat.

“There’s a certain point at about day three where you can feel the whole room go poof,” she said. “And everyone realizes we’re now in one body, one mind.” I asked her how this transformation was achieved. “We don’t say we’re deconstructing the self, but that is what we’re doing,” she told me. “Living in silence means you can’t start a conversation, so there’s no opportunity for self-presentation. Then there are the rituals that organize the day. These draw people into the group and relieve them of having to make decisions. Rituals take the place of a certain amount of volition.” It hadn’t occurred to me that ritual and silence could serve as tools to change consciousness and breach the hard shell of self.

But it is the agony of meditating for hours at a time that finally breaks down the ego. I asked her what people meditate about. “Mostly they ruminate and plan,” she said. “They do that until they can’t stand the thought of themselves any longer. You’re just sitting there for hours on end, and the entertainment value of watching the same reruns all day long diminishes over time. Pretty soon, it becomes unsustainable; they’re exhausted and uncomfortable, and that’s when they drop in.”

To “drop in,” Halifax explained, is to enter a state of being completely present in time and space, experiencing “the sense field”—the world as it appears to our senses prior to thought—without conceptualizing, and surrendering the sense of a separate self. The recipe was simpler (and much less appetizing) than I would have imagined: To transcend the self, force yourself to be alone with it long enough to get so bored and exhausted that you are happy to let it go.

Poof!

Halifax, who did anthropological fieldwork in Africa, thinks of the Zen retreat as an initiation ceremony, or rite of passage, and like most such rites, it involves the metaphorical death of the ego followed by rejoining the group. She regards the psychedelic trip as another rite of initiation, but “it’s a shortcut,” and one she’d rather her students not take. I wondered if this helped explain why she preferred that I stay at the refuge rather than mingle with her students at Upaya. Perhaps she thought contact with me would undermine the process by encouraging them to take the psychedelic shortcut.

“There is a lot gained when we give up the self,” she noted. “We break out of rumination. We discover we’re part of something larger, and we learn it feels good to care for others.” When I asked Halifax if she had succeeded in exorcising her own self, she allowed that she can be self-righteous at times. “There is moral injury, moral outrage, moral apathy—all of them are products of either a sense of superiority or inferiority,” she said. “So they’re all ego-based.”

I came to understand that Roshi Joan had sent me to the cave because there were no words or ideas she could offer that would teach me as much as simply being completely alone with myself in the middle of these mountains, with no phone or any other screens (and no toilet). Her idea, I eventually saw, was to pose a kind of experiential koan for me to puzzle and, perhaps, to help me unlearn some of the things I thought I had learned about consciousness and the self.

Cave life quickly stripped down to the bare essentials: collecting, splitting, and stacking wood; building fires; hauling water; digging pits in the woods; sweeping the floor and threshold; and, for hours each day, meditating on the platform. I’ve meditated for several years now, but never as easily or as deeply or as strangely as I did in my little cave. It may have been the silence, which felt bottomless, or the certainty that I would not be interrupted or distracted. Even the air there felt different, as if the absence of the electromagnetic waves that normally surround and pass through us made it easier to empty the mind of its usual detritus. I found I could sit for hours at a time, something I’d never managed to do before.

It helped that there was nothing else I needed to do, except maybe brew a cup of tea or sweep the cave again. Somehow, these seemed like particularly cave-appropriate activities. I fell into a routine so elemental and repetitive that it began to feel like ritual. The only snafu came the first time I attempted to use my hand-dug pit toilet and, failing to position myself properly, managed to pee into my sneaker. Now I was a shoeless monk. Which also seemed cave-appropriate.

One morning, I decided to try a meditation I’d learned from my time with the Nepalese French Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard, who has written extensively on the self as an illusion. To see this, he suggested I explore the rooms of my mind, one by one, as if searching for a thief—what he called “the thief of self.” Looking within, I found all sorts of mental stuff but, as Ricard had predicted, none of it qualified as a self. Rather, I witnessed a parade of unbidden, free-floating perceptions, feelings, images, sensations, and thoughts, but I could locate no thinker of these thoughts or perceiver of these perceptions.

The longer I sat, the stranger these appearances became, as the space of my awareness became an empty stage. Picture a circus ring where all kinds of images might suddenly and inexplicably appear out of nowhere. Why is there now a bank of three old-timey telephone booths with men inside making calls? And what’s this hammer suddenly coming down on a knee?! Or that automatic glass door swinging open for no one? These stray images were then blasted away by a blazing sun that completely filled the space of awareness before transforming itself into a gigantic eyeball—a sighted sun with a black circle of iris. Could this be the anarchic mind that emerges when the ego relinquishes its hold?

Maybe, and yet these dreamy, hypnagogic images were more curious than frightening, probably because it was easy enough to chase them away, to change the mental channel, simply by willing it. So then who, or what, did the chasing? The source of that will, that inchoate “I,” might have escaped introspective detection, yet it could still make things happen or stop happening. The self might well be illusory, I decided, but no more so than color or any other construct of the mind. Put another way, the self can be both illusory and real, or real enough.

Initially, I found I was talking to myself out loud, trying to fill the vast space of silence, which made it feel as though I had doubled my self rather than eliminated it—given it a little company. “Should I brew a cup of tea? Put another log on the fire?” I would ask. And I would answer: “Sure,” or “Good idea.” But after a day or two, I fell in love with the silence, and the voices stopped. I found the handful of chores completely absorbing, as if nothing in the world mattered as much as splitting firewood, fully occupying my attention and leaving no remainder of thought, self-consciousness, or anticipation. The distance between living and meditating had narrowed to a sliver. When I described the satisfactions of my routine to Roshi Joan during one of our hikes, she smiled: “That’s the sacredness of the everyday.”

Something was happening to my sense of self, and it seemed to have everything to do with what was happening to my sense of time. I had never given much thought to the relationship between self and time, but it explains a lot. When the self is deprived of time past (memory) and future (anticipation), it melts away. Absorbed in meditation, or in my chores, or in watching a small herd of elk graze in the meadow below at sunset, I could feel my time horizon shrink. The feeling was unfamiliar, since my usual mental coordinates place me somewhere in the proximate future, a locus of anticipation and, all too often, unfocused worry. But now, for longer and longer stretches, I was simply here, being, with no thought of the past or the future.

To my surprise, these moments of simple and more or less self-less consciousness did not occur when my eyes were closed—in fact, the darkness sent me zooming off to all kinds of strange places. No, now it was when my eyes were open that the stream of thought stilled and pooled, and not only on the meditation platform; it could happen when I was moving around the cave doing chores or hiking in the woods. The miraculous everyday fact of consciousness loomed larger than “the hard problem” of how a brain produces subjective experience.

Had I “dropped in”? There were moments when all I experienced was what Roshi Joan had called the “sense field.” This happened especially upon opening my eyes in meditation, but it was never very long before I slipped back into reflection and then the inevitable jotting-down of notes, and all at once I was back in the self-world. To stay in that state of unthinking presence was like walking a tightrope only to suddenly look down, panic, and come plunging back to Earth.

Except once, when I managed to look not down but up. I had woken up in the middle of the night and stepped outside into the cold night air. There was a new moon, and the only light in the world was that of the stars, which were out in force, brighter and more numerous than I’d ever seen them, but also strangely different. Instead of dotting the same black scrim, like pinholes in a two-dimensional theater backdrop, the stars were scattered through space at dramatically varying distances, a vast swarm of them filling every last corner of an even vaster, more numinous, and emphatically three-dimensional darkness. Even stranger, the negative space between the stars had flipped to positive, forming a soft, almost palpable blackness that embraced the stars and reached all the way to Earth, enveloping it and me in the same intergalactic blanket. For the first time, I could see—no, could feel—that the stars and I shared the same infinite space.

My brain’s usual priors, predictions, and inferences about the night sky had broken down, it seemed, allowing me to see more of the galaxy and space itself than I ever had. There was hugely more of it and less of me, rendered infinitesimal in the presence of this immensity. I felt as though every previous experience I’d had of the night sky had been filtered through some idea or model or expectation and so had been something less than completely conscious. And I understood that this state—abstracted, distracted—had been my default. A line in a poem by Jorie Graham came to me:

Only we, the humans. Yes! What other animal can afford to be anything less than completely conscious?

This moment of being fully, freshly present to the universe stopped me cold and made me wonder if all my hard thinking about consciousness had missed something crucial about it. The more I focused the narrow beam of my attention on what consciousness is and what it does and how it came to be, the less of it I was actually experiencing—whatever it was. My time in the cave and, now, beneath this night sky showed me the price of my impatience with the mystery.

“Always keep a don’t-know mind,” Roshi Joan had said to me. Sometimes not knowing opens us to possibilities that knowing, or trying to know, or thinking we already know, closes off. In the years since I had embarked on this inquiry, desperate to know, I had narrowed the aperture of my awareness, sacrificing this, the glory of the night sky, for a keen intellectual focus. But as my days of solitude in these mountains had shown me, that wider circle of light, that numinous lantern of awareness, is still available to us, so long as we can break the spell of self and its distractions. Consciousness is a miracle, truly, and remains the deepest of mysteries, yes, but it is also so very simple that it can fit into a sentence: I open my eyes and a world appears.

        Elizabeth Short liked to wander. Sometimes this wandering was merely in her mind, watching movies and dreaming of a life far beyond her hometown of Medford, Massachusetts. Many times, it was physical; she’d land in a new city—Miami, Jacksonville, Chicago, Long Beach, San Diego, Los Angeles—and explore its streets on foot. Sometimes her travels revolved around family, as when she tracked down her long-lost father and lived with him for a time—until he cast her out. On January 9, 1947, Short, who was 22, told a gentleman friend to drop her off at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, where her sister was supposedly waiting. She was never seen alive again.

A contemporary version of Elizabeth—dreamy, elusive, independent, and canny—might be called a flaneuse, someone curious about the world. But we’ll never know what kind of life she would have led; by the time her bisected body was found in a vacant lot, six days after she left the Biltmore, Elizabeth had ceased to be a person. From then on, she became “The Black Dahlia,” an archetype, a myth, a riddle that countless people have attempted to solve in books, films, television shows, podcasts, websites, internet-message boards, and social-media posts.

“After we are dead, the pretense that we may be protected against the world’s careless malice is abandoned,” Janet Malcolm wrote in her book The Silent Woman. She was referring to the poet and novelist Sylvia Plath, another beautiful young woman who died too soon, after which her life and words became grist for the biographical mill. But Malcolm’s words apply equally, even eerily, to the afterlife of Short—one of America’s most famous murder victims, and certainly among the most persistent subjects of the true-crime industrial complex.

From the moment Short’s killing became headline news, sensation was the prime directive. With every new lead, confession, and suspect, the actual Elizabeth receded further. It didn’t help that she was an enigmatic character in life, prone to embellishment and even lies. She recounted tales of woe to paramours only to ask them for money, exaggerated her prospects in missives to her mother, told friends about a dead husband and a child who probably didn’t exist—all without letting on about her actual precarious straits. Short avoided the spotlight, but over the nearly 80 years since her death, it has wholly consumed her.

This kind of flattening happens all too often with murder victims, particularly young women and girls who die at the hands of a serial killer, usually male. (Never mind that more marginalized women, especially women of color, are less likely to merit any attention at all.) In Short’s case, the flattening is particularly egregious, because the inchoate facts of her life are shoehorned into the obsessions of amateur sleuths who continue to get those facts wrong.

William J. Mann’s new book, Black Dahlia: Murder, Monsters, and Madness in Midcentury Hollywood, attempts a different approach: to weave the fragments we have into a narrative whole that prioritizes Short, in all of her contradictions, and tries to debunk decades’ worth of accumulated myths. Although Mann’s effort stands apart from the overlong run of books about the case, it, too, is undercut by the need to name a likely suspect, playing into the true-crime imperative it aims to leave behind.

Mann begins Black Dahlia in late July 1946, several months before Short’s murder and not long after her arrival in Long Beach, California. Over the ensuing period, Short befriends women and dates men; wears sophisticated clothing, ankle-strapped high heels, and flowers in her hair; and comes across as “a very modest girl who never cursed or acted sexy,” in the words of one friend. The reader comes to understand why fascination has proved more appealing than facts: We know very little about her life. Short defied norms and customs. She seemed innocent in the ways of men but savvy enough to keep her dates at a respectful distance. The two women who knew her best during this time, Marjorie Graham and Anne Toth, whom Mann renders more fully than any author before him, still had trouble understanding what made Short tick.

Mann starts the story, however, from the vantage point of Tod Faulkner, who says he first spotted Short in a two-piece bathing suit, walking alone toward the beach, and saw her again several more times that summer. Faulkner was 11 at the time, and says he never forgot her. Yet after growing up to become a journalist, he was the one who immortalized the erroneous middle name “Ann,” in a 1971 article for the Los Angeles Times. Faulkner’s error would propagate in numerous articles, books, and films before being codified in the 1975 TV movie Who Is the Black Dahlia?, which starred Lucie Arnaz (the daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz) as Short. Already we have the conflict between truth and myth, and we’re only on page four.

From there, Mann situates the known facts about the last few months of Short’s life in postwar Los Angeles, whose rising murder rate led to an even sharper spike in fear. From 1945 to 1946, “while the homicide rate for men grew by 26.8 percent, the number of women murdered in that same period shot up by 52.9 percent,” Mann points out. Over the next few years, the increase in violent deaths of women, seemingly at the hands of strangers, was reflected in the growing genre of film noir and in novels including Dorothy B. Hughes’s In a Lonely Place, which was published less than a year after Short’s murder.

Fear also sold newspapers, as any tabloid journalist at the time could tell you. And tell people they did, particularly in the early days and weeks after Short’s death, when the tiniest new detail about the “Black Dahlia” investigation—even, or especially, if that detail wasn’t true—could boost circulation. Mann calls out many instances of “sexing up the news” (a phrase he uses multiple times): the description of the block where Short’s body was discovered as a “lover’s lane”; invented testimony from witnesses and family members (including Short’s grieving mother, Phoebe); exaggerations in the memoirs of the L.A. newspaper editors Agness Underwood and Jimmy Richardson, early chroniclers—and shapers—of the murder narrative.

The errors and suppositions would multiply over the decades—most of them cataloged by the former L.A. Times reporter and historian Larry Harnisch. Was Short a sex worker? Blame John Gregory Dunne’s otherwise terrific 1977 novel, True Confessions, which gave its Short stand-in the moniker “The Virgin Tramp” along with a past career in pornography. (Without True Confessions, James Ellroy probably wouldn’t have written his own The Black Dahlia novel in 1987, which led to a 2006 film adaptation.) Did she have sexual dysfunction? That’s an invention of a former Examiner reporter, Will Fowler, bolstered by John Gilmore in his supposedly nonfiction 1994 account, Severed, which includes information from a detective, “Herman Willis,” who doesn’t seem to have existed.

False suspects also proliferated. Was George Hodel the killer? So his son Steve Hodel keeps insisting, first in his 2003 book, Black Dahlia Avenger, then in a later book that also puts George forward as the Zodiac Killer (oy). Janice Knowlton, too, believed that her father murdered Elizabeth: Read about it in Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer. Piu Eatwell’s Black Dahlia, Red Rose initially convinced me that Leslie Dillon was the culprit, but Mann’s account definitively rules Dillon out. Eli Frankel’s Sisters in Death, published just last year, strains (and, to my mind, fails) to connect Short to an unsolved murder in Kansas City. And a new podcast hosted by Michael Connelly, Killer in the Code, also tries to connect the Black Dahlia and the Zodiac Killer, with the help of a “cold-case consultant” who bases his “smoking gun” on a deathbed sketch that better resembles fan art.

Shiftiness, con artistry, and even violence toward women don’t add up to hard, incriminating evidence. Mann, too, succumbs to the temptation, perhaps reluctantly; he spends precious pages explaining why one of Elizabeth’s Long Beach boyfriends, a military veteran named Marvin Margolis who died in 1993—the same suspect in Connelly’s podcast—can’t be ruled out as the killer. (The original detectives crossed him off the list early in the investigation.) Even Mann seems dissatisfied when he mulls the prospect that a stranger killed Short: “She was simply a vulnerable young woman who came face-to-face with someone with severe and violent psychopathology who decided, either on impulse or deliberation, to kill her, to use her body to express rage and resentment at the world.”

After so much time has passed, no one is likely to be satisfied with any identification of Short’s killer. If the lead detective, Harry Hansen, is to be believed, the Los Angeles Police Department never once interviewed the actual killer despite interrogating scores of suspects—including all of those mentioned in prior books, and now Mann’s. Any outcome would likely resemble the identification last September, via investigative genetic genealogy, of the man responsible for the 1991 quadruple homicide in Austin, Texas, known as the “Yogurt Shop Murders.” In that case, pinning down the murderer didn’t erase the 34 years of anguish and damage sustained by the girls’ families and the young men wrongfully convicted—including one who had been on death row. After decades of pain and exploitation, solving the case feels like an anticlimax.

“Solving” the Black Dahlia case, most likely through genetic genealogy, may bring an answer, but it would only generate many more questions. Harnisch, the historian, who knows more about the case than almost anybody (and has a credible theory relegated to a footnote in Mann’s book), put it best in a 2020 interview: “This is a story that fades to conjecture. This is a story without an ending.”

Look past the need for narrative and there, out on the horizon, is Elizabeth Short, walking down a California boulevard, trying to create a better story for herself. She didn’t have to remain forever a girl wounded by her father’s rejection, too proud to admit the truth about her life to her mother and sisters, yet resourceful enough to survive, for a time, in a world that couldn’t care less. Her luck ran out, and we don’t know why, or who killed her. But the brutality of Short’s death shouldn’t supersede her life any more than myth should overshadow a larger truth: that her murder will never truly make any sense.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> This article examines the historical role of fiction as a moral and philosophical guide, contrasting the explicit wisdom-seeking of 19th-century authors with modern literature's retreat from such goals. It focuses on George Saunders as a prominent exception to this trend, while ultimately critiquing his new novel, 'Vigil,' for failing to reconcile its high ethical ideals with the messy complexities of human reality.

        <hr/>
        It was once commonly understood that fiction was in the wisdom business, that it offered not only aesthetic pleasure but also moral improvement. This function of literature was not tough to spot. One of the first English novels was Samuel Richardson’s 1740 work, Pamela: Or, Virtue Rewarded—a title not meant ironically. Through the 19th century, many authors turned directly to the reader with philosophical and social (if sometimes ironic) commentary: “It is a truth universally acknowledged”; “It was the best of times”; “All happy families are alike.” For readers not up to the challenge of full George Eliot novels, her enterprising publisher compiled a volume of Eliot’s many Wise, Witty, and Tender Sayings, in order to more broadly distribute “a morality as pure as it is impassioned.”

Such open authorial musing, and maybe literature’s wisdom-seeking function itself, has been out of vogue during the past century of show-don’t-tell storytelling. Although this has surely spared us some clunky sermonizing, it has brought downsides as well. Too many writers seem to have overlooked what I consider to be a key piece of the mission. I can’t tell you how many novels I’ve abandoned in the belief that the writer has nothing to teach me—and, worse, is not even trying to learn. Over the past couple of years, as the evident decline of literary reading has been blamed on the ubiquity of smartphones or the supposed withdrawal of men, I’ve suspected that some readers might be tuning out fiction (or turning to the classics over contemporary work) for another reason: the sense that today’s novelists are not aiming to help with the practical matter of how to live.

By George Saunders

George Saunders is an eminent exception to contemporary literature’s broader retreat from wisdom-seeking. The Booker-winning and best-selling author has not embedded direct, Eliot-style philosophizing within his fiction, but he is distinctive for thoroughly embracing the role of moral guide—and for seeing his preacher-writer role resonate with an unusually large audience. His fiction has always had an ethical thrust, at its strongest in inventive and often brilliant short stories that channel the economically weak and exploited. And Saunders’s enterprising publisher has lately offered his wise, witty, and tender sayings in stand-alone works: Congratulations, by the Way was adapted from a graduation speech enjoining kindness; A Swim in a Pond in the Rain is a version of his Syracuse University course about Russian writers who, he explains, “regard fiction not as something decorative but as a vital moral-ethical tool.” In A Swim, Saunders has given grateful critics a tidy summary of his message: “that every human being is worthy of attention and that the origins of every good and evil capability of the universe may be found by observing a single, even very humble, person and the turnings of his or her mind.”

Amen. I mean that sincerely. So it was with some disappointment that I discovered that Saunders’s new novel, Vigil—although showcasing his great gifts for voice, farce, and tick-tick-tick plotting—suffers from the all-too-human foible of claiming high ideals while failing to actually abide by them. As in some too-pious novels of earlier eras, Vigil’s abundantly clear moral vision is enabled only by dodging the hardest ethical (and artistic) problem: the pragmatic task of fitting our morals to the confounding reality of human experience.

Like Lincoln in the Bardo, Saunders’s other novel, Vigil is set on the spooky cusp between life and death. The narrator, Jill, is essentially a supernatural priest—a ghost whose task is to swoop into the minds of the dying to provide “comfort” and “elevation” before judgment is rendered. Murdered at age 22, Jill has, after inhabiting and forgiving her murderer, reached a special state of being: “vast, unlimited in the range and delicacy of my voice, unrestrained in love, rapid in apprehension, skillful in motion, capable, equally, of traversing, within a few seconds’ time, a mile or ten thousand miles.” (Never has a novelist found a tidier vehicle for his own mission.) Jill has learned in her elevated state to see every individual as “an inevitable occurrence,” a fated being with choices “so severely delimited” that what feels like free will is actually “a sort of lavish jailing.”

Jill’s “charge,” her new assignment, is an oil tycoon named K. J. Boone, who at 87 is dying of cancer and past the point of speech. In the novel’s first pages, Jill observes a wall of photos: Boone on oil rigs, at his many homes, and “leaning confidently against a podium, speaking to a tremendous crowd.” When she enters his mind, she finds “a steady flow of satisfaction, even triumph.” She scans for doubts and mistakes but finds “nothing, or nearly nothing. He was as sure of himself as ever a charge of mine had been.”

It was an odd thing to finish Vigil feeling that an oil tycoon had been treated unfairly. Saunders has for decades critiqued capitalist systems, but still, I figured I knew where this deathbed visitation must go: As Jill observed the turnings of Boone’s mind, she would uncover the self-satisfied titan’s hidden nobility and frailty; meanwhile, Boone would confront his uncertainties and failings, and the false caricatures at the novel’s start would by the end give way to a nuanced, proportionate truth.

What happens instead is more like a mobbing. Boone is relentlessly hounded by figments of his guilty memory, by other ghosts, and by his daughter—all of whom emphasize his nefarious role in delaying action to combat climate change. The lead ghost campaigner, a slapstick Frenchman, pelts Boone with apparitions: odd weather patterns, extinct birds, a starved man from a decimated Indian village. Boone’s daughter, praying at his bedside, veers into thinking about a documentary that one of her “libdope” friends tricked her into watching, which left her greatly disappointed in her father. Boone refuses chance after chance to admit error.

Although the prosecution of Boone is, characteristically of Saunders, often funny and sometimes moving, it is also unmistakably unkind. Saunders seems unwilling to convey Boone’s more sympathetic attributes without some swift reminder that he’s a bastard. Boone is self-made, but his memories of a dirt-poor childhood are undercut, one page later, by a scene in which he berates his employees and enjoys it. We see Boone snap at his “chubby bimbo” oncology nurse, call Jill a “stupid bitch,” and repeatedly insist that in his whole life, he “had done nothing wrong, not a goddamn thing,” and that anyone who suggests otherwise is an “idiot.” Of his exceptional professional success—Boone’s entire career—we are told only that “it had all been accomplished” with “work, hard work, but no real struggle. Up, up, up he went” and “never along the way had there been a moment of hesitation or doubt” until these “losers, trivial people,” began to “piss and moan” about climate change.

Boone’s major crime is, rather than selling oil to a world hungry for it, an act of dishonesty—largely a lie of omission. Although his company’s internal data showed a warming planet, Boone gave speeches, funded research, and sponsored lobbying and advertising campaigns to muddle the scientific consensus and delay regulatory action. This is an interesting choice of sin, because the failure to cop to inconvenient truths is precisely the cardinal sin of Vigil itself: the refusal to let Jill or Boone become more complex than cartoons.

Jill remains impossibly sentimental and pure of heart, even as she grows horrified by Boone and considers abandoning her effort to comfort him. As for Boone, we might invoke the Russians. Saul Bellow once wrote that what made Dostoyevsky a great novelist was his understanding that “the writer’s convictions, perhaps fanatically held, must be tamed by truth.” It seems to me that Saunders’s perhaps fanatical loathing of oil executives—Boone bears many similarities, in particular, to former Exxon CEO Lee Raymond—was not here tamed by the reality of how people find their roles in the world and justify the (sometimes villainous) choices those roles might require. Saunders proffers no evidence that Boone, say, wrestled with the responsibilities of leadership, or was charming or generous, or cared to do anything with other people but dominate them. One truth of which Vigil seems deliberately oblivious is that many of those who inspire confidence and deference, as Boone did, have something going for them. But the book cannot credit Boone with commonplace human thoughtfulness. Even his allies damn him by association: His fond daughter’s prayers reveal her to be a haughty, materialistic racist, and the ghosts of his former collaborators are transparently demonic, letting loose “hellish cackling laughter” at the memory of duping the public. I had the feeling of watching a show trial in which the defense, under the gaze of a stern commissar, has been forbidden to make a case.

I will avoid spoiling the precise mechanics of the ending, except to say that the reader’s satisfaction in Jill’s ultimate choice depends on a familiar idea that even the worst sinners deserve another chance—as long as they confess. This might be an ordinary perspective for a priest, but it felt strangely authoritarian for a fiction writer. Vigil’s lesson appears to be that right is right, wrong is wrong, and the primary challenge of virtuous living lies not in discerning or applying wisdom but rather in mustering, from a state of completed revelation, the grace to admit and forgive crystal-clear sins. The confidence of Vigil’s final judgment seems out of step with Saunders’s view, as stated in A Swim, that “the aim of art” is “to ask the big questions” such as: “How are we supposed to be living down here?”

I should at this point concede that I enjoyed every swift page of Vigil’s prose. It is stuffed with lively wit and striking images, and I was delighted as usual by Saunders’s ability, like that of Hollywood’s defter practitioners, to rib himself and winkingly manipulate his tropes. But I was taken aback by the malice of staging a deathbed inquisition that reduces the decedent, whatever his offenses, to cliché. I would argue, if I might preach at Saunders for a moment, that the most sacred duty of the writer is to do full justice—to inhabit, alongside even maddening wickedness, a charitable understanding of the way a person sees himself—and that to do so is much kinder than merely offering a caricatured figure a shot at avoiding eternal torment.

        <hr/>
        Sometimes the country wants a man of faith. This happened when Jimmy Carter, a former Sunday-school teacher, was elected following Watergate, and when the born-again George W. Bush’s slim victory looked like a repudiation of Bill Clinton’s sex-scandal-marred presidency. To speak in the register of faith—not a particular sect or even God, but a grounding belief in a higher order—is to reach beyond partisanship, to try to return to basic moral precepts. In calmer times, a leader expounding from such heights risks sounding preachy and self-righteous. But when the country is exhausted, this might be just what people want.

Right now, the country is exhausted. And Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a top contender for president in 2028, has a new memoir in which the word faith appears nearly 100 times.

In Where We Keep the Light, Shapiro is doing what presumptive candidates for the highest office usually do when they write such a book: He is laminating his narrative. Here is the regular guy who loves shooting hoops, who is hopeless with a hammer, who loves a self-deprecating story about walking into a glass wall or almost falling off a ladder, and whose wife, Lori, is always, always right. He is, in short, pretty boring by almost any measure, and his book can lapse into the gobbledygook of clichés that fill such memoirs—Shapiro is able, for example, “to make a choice and then execute it” when “all eyes were watching.” What stands out, however, is the centrality of his religion—or rather, his faith—which is Judaism.

At the moment, Shapiro would seem to have every reason to downplay his Jewishness. When he was one of the two top contenders to be Kamala Harris’s running mate in 2024, this part of his identity was frequently touted as a liability. “He’s Jewish,” CNN’s John King pointed out, so “there could be some risk in putting him on the ticket.” Others put it less nicely. Certain camps on the far left of the Democratic Party branded him as “Genocide Josh” for his support of Israel after October 7—though his views were not much different from those of most of the Democratic establishment. Add to this the rise of an ambient anti-Semitism on both the right and the left, along with the unavoidable reality that Jews are a minuscule minority in this country; any candidate who keeps kosher must overcome a certain strangeness factor if he wants to pass that all-important test of being someone to have a beer with.

But rather than downplay his Jewishness in his memoir, Shapiro puts it at the center of the political identity he is prepping for the national stage. He does this, however, in a quirky—and perhaps savvy—way: Shapiro uses the flexibility of Jewish identity to speak about faith without really delving into the particularity of Judaism.

He can do this because Jewishness is not one thing. It can be a cultural identity—like the Seinfeld-and-bagels version. It can be an ethnic or even a national identity (otherwise known as Zionism). And it can be a religious identity, a set of rituals and practices either strictly adhered to or modified over time. For any individual Jew, the mix will vary wildly. The crux of Shapiro’s Jewishness, by his account, is the religion, but he writes that it is “less about the story and the text than about the lesson and the deed.” He does abide by many of those rituals and practices—such as keeping kosher and not missing Shabbat dinner with his family—but these aren’t the elements he emphasizes. The book is heavily weighted instead toward the thing he calls “faith,” with himself as its “steward.” To my ear at least, this sounds more like the way an evangelical Christian might speak of their religion, but for Shapiro, this word becomes a bridge between who he is and the people he is trying to reach.

Faith here means a kind of centeredness, an inner voice, a prayerfulness. He admits that this all might “sound a little vague”—it does—and he struggles to define exactly what faith means to him beyond the fact that it is the most important aspect of his identity and that it allows him to judge right from wrong, to separate the trivial from what actually matters. Defining his beliefs is “kind of like when you get asked to explain how you fall asleep or blink,” he writes. “You just know to do it.” But faith, for all its squishiness, is the force he deploys, again and again, as a way to connect with other Americans. It is, in other words, not just a central part of himself, but also what turns his Judaism from a potential liability into a potential asset.

After the governor’s mansion was firebombed last year, hours after the Shapiro family had held their Passover seder, an elderly fire-department chaplain named John Wardle handed Shapiro a handwritten prayer. Shapiro choked up immediately: These words of blessing and protection (from Numbers 6:24–26) were the same that he utters in Hebrew over his children every night. “Despite our differences, at our cores, our values are the same,” he concludes. “Our humanity is shared.” When he calls the family of the man who was killed in the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, he worries at first that fierce Trump supporters, even in grief, won’t want to speak with him. But then: “I told them about my faith and how much strength it has brought to me in my life,” Shapiro writes, “and that while we didn’t share the same faith, I knew theirs would bring them calm.”

Episodes like these coalesce into the central motif of his memoir: faith as an eraser of difference. Whom does he count as his closest adviser on keeping this faith? Well, Lori, of course. But after her, the person he turns to when he has a problem is a Black Baptist pastor named Marshall Mitchell. In an ecumenical text chain, they go “back and forth about a line from the Book of John or a passage from the Book of Joshua.”

The laws of Judaism are traditionally meant to create distance, to distinguish Jews from other people. This is what kashrut and Sabbath observance are about—avoiding certain food or workdays as a way of setting themselves apart. When Joe Lieberman was Al Gore’s vice-presidential candidate, he made a point of emphasizing this difference—everyone near him knew that he was strict about not doing business on Saturday and would bring his tuna sandwiches on the road to make it easier to keep kosher. This was part of the appeal of his candidacy, a return to traditionalism after the Clintonian chaos (Bush’s born-again Christianity promised the same). But Shapiro de-emphasizes the rules of Judaism. He has to, because it’s the only way faith can function for him in this story. “For me it is spirituality more than religiousness,” Shapiro writes.

As he elides the rules of Judaism to focus on the “soul work,” he also makes only passing references to October 7, and he manages to completely avoid mentioning Gaza—as in, not even once. Shapiro has been outspoken in his criticism of the Israeli government (Benjamin Netanyahu, he has said, is “one of the worst leaders of all time”). He has also called out some of the pro-Palestinian protests on campuses, believing they tipped over into being anti-Semitic. Shapiro is a liberal Zionist, which means he has a nuanced position on the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians at a moment when, on this topic, few people who care about the issue really want to hear nuance. But when Israel does appear in the book, he doesn’t lay any of this out. Instead, the Jewish homeland is just the place where he first connected with—yes—his faith. “In Israel, it was just everywhere,” he writes. “It was the first time I could feel faith. I could see it and touch it and it wasn’t abstract.”

There is something unique, perhaps even brave, about discussing Israel in this way, as a place perceived not just through a political lens but one that could have so much meaning to a Jewish teenager from suburban Philadelphia (he even proposed to Lori in Jerusalem). And yet the faction in the Democratic Party that called him “Genocide Josh” has not gone away, and neither has the unfair suspicion that he had to confront when he was vetted by Harris’s people and was asked, he writes in the book, whether he had ever been “an agent of the Israeli government.” These voices have only gotten louder, with large parts of the Democratic Party openly opposing the United States’ continued support of Israel. A Jewish candidate such as Shapiro might want to focus on faith, but he has to face up to the reality, fair or not, that he will be asked to explain Israel’s actions more than a Mormon or Catholic candidate would. By avoiding it completely in his campaign memoir, he only confirms just how much he does not want the subject to overtake his candidacy—and concedes, in a way, that it very well could.

What comes across loud and clear, though, is Shapiro’s bet that Americans want someone like him, who can talk earnestly about concepts such as good and evil, and what it means to have moral clarity. “Now, more than ever, we yearn for and need a world defined by faith,” he writes in the book’s closing lines. “It’s universal, this belief in others to help us through what feels unsettled, uncivil, un-American. It’s a guidepost, a path through the woods.”

At a time when citizens are on the streets in Minneapolis risking their lives in order to protect their neighbors, this sentiment feels like a resonant one. The motivation for confronting masked, armed agents with whistles and phones is not as much political as it is moral. These people are angry that something has gone awry in the way we treat one another, that we have lost a sense of the common good—an understanding of what is normal and what isn’t. This is the place where Shapiro is firmly planting himself, and whether you find his fulsome profession of faith to be authentic—I do—it might also be a pretty good strategy for winning.

        <hr/>
        Nearly as old as Ahab (one more birthday and I’ll be 58: his age), I drive south from Boston on a recent Saturday morning. Through a raging drabness of Massachusetts wintertime, I drive and drive: leaky light without a source; seething, decaying snow.

I’m on a mission here. A collision with immensity awaits: the 2026 Moby-Dick Marathon at the New Bedford Whaling Museum. Programming, scholarship, and—the event’s steadily droning core—a 25-hour cover-to-cover reading of the great book itself. Hundreds of volunteer readers, in five-minute increments, from noon on Saturday to 1 p.m. on Sunday. A test of my fortitude as a listener, of my ability to keep my behind in a seat.

But I am faint. Succor is required. I pull over at the Bridgewater Service Plaza because sometimes what you need is to quietly conform yourself to the will of God, and sometimes what you need is a cup of stinking black coffee and a Dunkin’ glazed doughnut.

Into snowy New Bedford, into the Whaling Museum, into the room where they keep the Lagoda, the museum’s half-scale model of a whaling bark. A room with a ship in it, in other words. Two stories high (to accommodate the ship’s masts) and stuffed, draped, festooned with humanity: sitters, knitters, nesters, kneelers, sprawlers, leaners, drifters like me, stashed in every alcove and stretched along every railing and baseboard. At noon on the nose, the Massachusetts poet laureate, Regie Gibson, steps up to the lectern: “Call me … Ishmael.” The whoop, the sound of exulting Moby-Dick nuts, goes raggedly around the galleries and hallways of the museum. The tale begins, of course, in New Bedford, where Ishmael arrives “on a Saturday night in December” in search of a whaling voyage. We have embarked.

Moby-Dick, by Herman Melville, published in 1851. Let’s consider it. Is there another book at once so good and so bad, so thrilling and so boring, so authentic to the currents of the soul and so hideously contrived, so stunningly patrolled by dreamlike visions and so crushed by its own intellectual baggage?

There’s no denying the power, the pull, of its mighty twin symbols: burning-eyed indeflectible Ahab, captain of the Pequod, emblem of every human obsession, of the violence of the mind; and his quarry, the white whale, the lump of metaphysical mystique known as Moby Dick. Psychic facts, both of them. But what a welter of chaos they must rise through to reach us—what sub–Thomas Carlyle thunderings, what sub–Sir Thomas Browne conceits and curlicues, what sub-Shakespearean rants. Shakespeare especially: a terrible influence on Melville! All the interior monologues in Moby-Dick, and almost anything that comes out of the mouth of Ahab—all those reams of hoarse Elizabethan bluster—you can blame on Melville’s 1849 devouring of a new seven-volume edition of Shakespeare’s plays, in large print (he had weak eyes). Enthusiastic American, as he began writing Moby-Dick, he was wildly cranked on the Bard. But wait, hist, soft, listen—now we’re on Chapter 7, and a reader speaks out a perfect line of Shakespearean blank verse: “Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs.” Beautiful. I kiss my hand to you, Herman.

Melville would have enjoyed the New Bedford Whaling Museum. Like him, it is given to the grand gesture: whale skeletons suspended from the ceiling, floating above us like hierarchs at a superior level of being; the aforementioned room with a ship in it; and, right by the table where I buy my endless sustaining blueberry muffins and meat pies and cups of tea, a 600-pound life-size model in fiberglass of a blue whale’s heart, its ventricles large enough for a man to crawl into.

The readers: They are everyone. They have every quality. They are stammering, assured, dubious, virtuosic, inaudible, room-shaking, thick-voiced, thin-voiced, professional, innocent, mesmerizing, devoid of presence. It’s an American pageant, purely democratic, intensely moving. Reader by reader, the thread of meaning, the pulse, comes and goes. Some of them seem to seize us by the very roots of our comprehension; others might as well be reading from the Terms and Conditions of Use for Spotify. The prose of Moby-Dick is dense; it can be unwieldy—Melville’s mouthfuls are too large for our 21st-century mandibles. Some words that people have trouble with: idolator, remonstrances, vicissitudes, magnanimity, portentousness. Also (this one surprises me): leviathan.

With merciful swiftness, it is revealed that I cannot, simply cannot, listen to a succession of persons read from Moby-Dick for 25 hours. It’s an impossibility for me. I’m a modern man with all of the modern vices: inattention, solipsism, wooziness, dopamine addiction, twitching legs, low blood sugar, a persistent interest in going to the bathroom. So I phase in and out of the Marathon. I wander the museum; I wander the night streets of New Bedford, with their hostile glints of ice. At 7:02 p.m., I’m in the Pour Farm Tavern on Purchase Street, brooding over a double Jameson. Out of the jukebox, loaded with 1970s baggage but still moving, in 2026, with a slinking, predatory roll, comes Ted Nugent’s “Stranglehold.” The maniac Nugent, essential American, once a hard-rock warlock, now a vaunting Trumpist. Listen to the song: “Road I cruise is a bitch nowww, BAY-BEH! / You know you can’t turn me ’round / And if a house gets in my way, BAY-BEH! / You know I’ll burn it do-own.” Wow. How fucking Ahab is that?

Coming and going as I am, nevertheless, in my blue-whale heart, I remain attached to the collective, to the shared journey, the shared imagining, all of us with our copies of the book, all of us enmeshed in the great and groaning text. At 4:15 a.m. in the museum’s main auditorium, there’s a long-haul-flight vibe, people looking pale and rumpled as we steer toward Chapter 87, one of the most limpidly head-expanding chapters of the book: “The Grand Armada.”

Somewhere around Java, the Pequod hunts its way into an entire shoal of sperm whales: Its boats are lowered, and whereas at the edge of the shoal, the harpooneers set about their bloody and ocean-churning business, Ishmael’s boat finds itself in the supernaturally serene center. Peaceable whales approach; “like household dogs they came snuffling round us.” And in the transparent depths, a vision is disclosed: nursing mother whales.

Incredible prose, somewhere between journalism and science fiction. But a few paragraphs later, Melville falls into his old weakness, his old foible—he starts symbolizing. The violence at the rim of the shoal, the stillness at the center … He can’t help himself. He must go Sir Thomas Browne on our asses: “Even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.”

Is it a weakness, though? Maybe not. Maybe this nonstop back-and-forth, this spiritual reverb, this throb-throb oscillation between the actual and the symbolic, the objective and the imagined, is the heartbeat of Moby-Dick. Are things ever only themselves, or do they always attach to, refer to, other realities? Must all phenomena have meanings upon meanings? Can a whale ever be just a whale? My mind loops out. It’s 5 a.m. What if existence itself (a line from my notes) is a pun on existence? That’s pretty bloody Melvillean, dude. The man sitting in front of me—rugged, with a fine Rockwell Kent profile—tips forward and begins to emit gentle, bleating snores.

With the dawn—streaky and watery over New Bedford—everything accelerates. Now we’re in the final stretch. Now we’re closing in. At 9:30, in the museum’s research library, a group of Melville scholars holds a packed and slightly giddy informal symposium. A young man, confiding to us that this is his first time reading the book, and apologizing for the basic-ness of his question, asks, “Is Melville using Ishmael to, like, satirize the whole white-male epic of obsession and violence?” Beat. Hanging symposial silence—until one of the scholars, as in the Philip Larkin poem, pronounces an enormous “Yes!” and the room erupts into applause.

The final readings are happening upstairs, in the Harbor View Gallery, with livestreams to all parts of the museum. I’m watching in the auditorium, the doors are open to the main hall, and there’s a slight lag in the streaming between the two spaces. So on every phrase you get an echo: “There she blows!” (There she blows …) Talk about Melvillean reverb. Another line of pure Shakespearean verse drifts up: “Great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang.” (Deep pang …)

And who’s this guy reading the last chapter to us, Reader 277? He’s got to be an actor, a TV guy of some sort: He has an actor’s expressive and sympathetic handsomeness, soap-operatic facial symmetry, no bad angles. His name is Steven Weber (of Wings and Chicago Med, I later discover), he takes a deep breath, and then, my God, he tears the roof off the Moby-Dick Marathon. What a performance. The last battle with the white whale, the destruction (spoiler!) of the Pequod. Weber’s Ahab is all Ahab; his Starbuck is perfectly impassioned. “Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that madly seekest him!” We are agog. Afterward, briefly interviewed by the museum’s president, Amanda McMullen, Weber is almost overcome. “I’m so moved by this,” he manages. “This book, boy …”

According to the reading’s organizers, more than 3,000 people attended this year’s Moby-Dick Marathon. Prediction: Next year, if the Whaling Museum can handle it, it’ll be 5,000. I don’t want to label this event a node of resistance, but … it kind of is. It’s a radical act. An all-analog mass redreaming of a book. And not just any book—a flawed American gospel. With Moby-Dick itself, I may have my little fancy-pants peeves, but let’s face it: Ahab is Donald Trump, and Ahab is me, and I am you, and Ted Nugent is the Pequod, and the whale is the whale, and the voyage is America. These resonances ring out; they ring out from New Bedford and keep going, traveling west until they roll down the hills of California and sink hissing into the sea.

        <hr/>
        Whatever you might think you’re going to get from the familiar setup of Jennette McCurdy’s Half His Age (a lonely high-school girl in Anchorage begins an extremely questionable sexual relationship with her teacher), any presumptions are dispelled from the very first page. When Waldo, the teenage narrator of the novel, observes her boyfriend’s “slimy tongue that loop-de-loops over and over like a carnival ride, mechanical and passionless,” she’s setting a tone: irreverent, graphic, bilious.

McCurdy is much more interested in late capitalism than in Lolita. Waldo’s world has long been poisoned by the microwavable meals her disinterested mother leaves out, the fast-fashion crop tops she orders that come with a cancer warning, the laptop she falls asleep clutching at 2 a.m., its unnatural heat “searing my ovaries.” By the time she meets Mr. Korgy, her frowsy middle-aged creative-writing instructor, on page 11, she is already imprinted on the reader as a caustic force of anti-nature.

And so she seduces Korgy—of course she does. Their relationship ensues through the slow erosion of boundaries, mostly instigated by her but sometimes by him. She masturbates using a bottle of tropical-fruit-flavored Tums while stalking his Instagram. He praises her writing and asks her to stay after class; he later invites her to dinner at his home with his wife. She sends him a thank-you email with her phone number. He calls her. And so on, until they’re frantically humping in a janitorial closet, in her childhood bedroom, at hotels (after fancy dinners where people assume he’s her father). Mr. Korgy—his first name is Theodore, but Waldo never uses it—is no scheming predator. His wife calls him “Teddy” and tells emasculating anecdotes about him. He’s soft and pitiable where Waldo is ferocious in her loneliness and adept at transforming herself into various alluring guises.

Literature is rife with memoirs and works of autofiction about ravening English teachers, accounts of mentors who allegedly groomed vulnerable girls with writing and manipulated their own words. Half His Age is resolutely not one of these books. But McCurdy, who, as a child, starred in Nickelodeon shows alongside Ariana Grande and Miranda Cosgrove, knows well all the ways underage girls can be flattened and plasticized by adults—turned into objects. Her previous book, I’m Glad My Mom Died, recounted McCurdy’s childhood being coerced into performing by her narcissistic and mentally unstable mother, who introduced her daughter to ritualized anorexia at the age of 11 and was such a hoarder, storing objects in every bedroom in the house, that her children had to sleep on Costco mats on the living-room floor. (McCurdy also wrote about a man she called The Creator, widely speculated to be the Nickelodeon executive Dan Schneider, who has faced multiple accusations of inappropriate conduct and abuse; Schneider has denied many of the allegations, but apologized for making people uncomfortable on set.)

Half His Age, though, isn’t about abuse, or exploitation, or even the power dynamics of what we now call “age-gap relationships,” though Waldo is bracingly aware of the occasions when Mr. Korgy manipulates her emotionally, and far too astute to fall for his “I want to expose you to art and films and music and books” schtick. The book reads much more like a postmodern novel for the fast-fashion generation, a portrait of civilizational decline told through declining mall chains, ultra-processed foods, and relentless consumption. Online shopping isn’t just a compulsion for Waldo—it’s an assertion of her existence.

Temporally, Half His Age is hard to place. Waldo refers to Instagram and TikTok but doesn’t scroll; she obsesses over her appearance, grooming herself with rigor and self-loathing, but doesn’t post pictures of herself or seem to have an online footprint beyond her shopping orders. She lives in Alaska, but all we hear about it is that her summer days are “bloated” and her winters bleak. Her local hangouts are wholly generic: Waldo works at Victoria’s Secret to fund her shopping habit, eats breakfast with her mom at Denny’s, and survives on Auntie Anne’s pretzels, Marie Callender’s entrees, and Sour Patch Kids. She rattles off cosmetic brand names the same way Mr. Korgy lists his favorite directors (“Bergman and Kubrick and Kurosawa, Lonergan and Linklater and Solondz”)—as a way of underscoring her identity, even if it’s homogenous. Brands are omnipresent in her life, as extant as air. (When the two have sex in Korgy’s car, the feeling of Cheerio crumbs being ground into Waldo’s knees becomes a staple part of the experience.)

McCurdy’s brittle commentary made me think of Don DeLillo’s description of the supermarket in White Noise, with all the hyperreal produce “sprayed, burnished, bright” and inserted into “filmy bags.” At some point in the 20th century, the critic Cynthia Deitering has written of that novel, humanity oversaw one of its most profound transformations: “a shift from a culture defined by its production to a culture defined by its waste.” In DeLillo’s imagination, the specter hovering over all of this unnatural abundance is death; in McCurdy’s, it’s desire. How is Waldo supposed to know what she really wants when her synapses are distorted by the dopamine thrill of acquisition, the heart-stopping kick of something new? She’s not exactly surrounded by appealing prospects. “You think some beefy senior’s gonna be emotionally available between his rounds of Grand Theft Auto and his daily hour of Pornhub?” she tells Mr. Korgy. What she’s most drawn to in her teacher is the way he seems to live outside her dull, trashy monoculture. But his Crate & Barrel throw pillows are no more authentic than her mom’s HOME SWEET HOME Target doormat, or the Le Labo candles and coffee-table books at Waldo’s rich friend Frannie’s house. When Korgy Amazon-ships Waldo a grocery order of some of his favorite nourishing foods, she can manage only three bites of the “chocolate paleo crunch granola with almond milk” before throwing it away.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Following a period of relative quiet since 2020, professional athletes are returning to political activism in response to recent high-profile killings and federal policies. Led by figures like Breanna Stewart, who publicly protested against ICE, and supported by statements from the NBA Players Association, the sports world is seeing a resurgence of advocacy aimed at social justice and civil liberties.

        <hr/>
        Over the weekend, the basketball star Breanna Stewart didn’t have her normal bounce during player introductions. As soon as the announcer shouted her name, Stewart walked out holding a white sign with a message: Abolish ICE.

“I think that when human lives are at stake, it’s bigger than anything else,” Stewart said at a press conference following the game with Unrivaled, a three-on-three professional basketball league she co-founded in 2024.

Stewart’s declaration was daring because it was also personal. Her wife, Marta Xargay Casademont, was born in Spain and is in the United States on a green card. The couple is working on getting Casademont American citizenship, and Stewart criticizing ICE so publicly could jeopardize her chances.

During times of political and social turmoil, the public often looks to athletes to speak out against harmful policies and actions that are directed at marginalized communities. Doing so can be risky: The Trump administration has frequently attacked and mocked athletes who challenge the president, and many team owners are among Trump’s backers.

But it can be worthwhile. Historically, when athletes have chosen to speak out, their advocacy has helped effect real change. The often-cited example of how an athlete can shift the political discourse is the boxing icon Muhammad Ali’s refusal to be drafted into the Army in 1967 during the Vietnam War. In more recent times, we’ve seen stark examples of athletes changing the political dynamic with their involvement. As I wrote two years ago, in 2020 we saw athletes participating in the George Floyd protests and driving voter-registration campaigns. In Georgia, WNBA players banded together to help elect the state’s first Black senator, the Democrat Rapahel Warnock—despite the fact that his opponent, Kelly Loeffler, was a co-owner of the WNBA’s Atlanta Dream at the time. Loeffler drew players’ ire when she criticized them for supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. When Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot seven times in the back by Kenosha, Wisconsin, police that August, professional games across five different sports were postponed.

Since 2020, there’s been a notable decrease in athletes’ social and political engagement. But now, with recent events in Minnesota, that 2020 spirit seems to be tentatively flickering back to life. For instance, earlier this month, when a federal agent killed Renee Good, the Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers called her death a “straight-up murder.”

The fatal shooting of Alex Pretti on Saturday seems to be pushing this dynamic further, and feels like an inflection point similar to the one created by Floyd’s death. At Sunday’s game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Golden State Warriors, a moment of silence was held, during which people in the crowd yelled “Fuck ICE!” (The game had previously been scheduled for Saturday and was postponed, the league said, “to prioritize the safety and security of the Minneapolis community.”) Every major professional sports team in Minnesota joined numerous businesses and corporations in signing a letter released by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce calling for “an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.”

The NBA Players Association also released a statement: “The fraternity of NBA players, like the United States itself, is a community enriched by its global citizens, and we refuse to let the flames of division threaten the civil liberties that are meant to protect us all.”

Besides Stewart, Tyrese Haliburton, the All-Star point guard for the Indiana Pacers, and the NBA veteran Isaiah Thomas also made strong statements on X. Haliburton posted: “Alex Pretti was murdered.” Thomas wrote: “Yall had him out numbered and decided to KILL him like it was a video game and he can just [get] his life back smh.”

        Updated at 11:07 a.m. ET on January 30, 2026

In the waning heat of last summer, freshly back in my office at a major research university, I found myself considering the higher-education hellscape that had lately descended upon the nation. I’d spent months reporting on the Trump administration’s attacks on universities for The Atlantic, speaking with dozens of administrators, faculty, and students about the billions of dollars in cuts to public funding for research and the resulting collapse of “college life.”At the same time, I’d been chronicling the spread of AI-powered chatbots that have already changed undergraduates forever.

Initially, I surveyed the situation from the safe distance of a journalist who happens to also be a career professor and university administrator. I saw myself as an envoy between America’s college campuses and its citizens, telling the stories of the people whose lives had been shattered by these transformations. By the summer, though, that safe distance had collapsed back on me. The wave of campus crises was causing immediate effects in my own academic life. People I knew were losing their jobs. Yearslong projects were stranded. I heard from students cheating their way through every class with AI, and from faculty following suit. I watched professors lash out at other disciplines with misplaced blame. I listened to friends discuss whether they should send their kids to school abroad. I had personally devoted 25 years to higher education. Now it felt like the whole idea of the university might be ending.

Sitting in my office, I began searching for some cause for hope, some reason to believe that higher ed could stanch the damage for the next generation of students. It occurred to me that I’d been hearing less despair from colleagues at certain smaller schools that offer undergraduate study in the “liberal-arts tradition,” a broad and flexible approach to education that values developing the person over professional training. I wondered if these schools—especially the wealthy ones that cluster near the top of national rankings—might enjoy some natural insulation from the fires raging through the nation’s research universities.

I texted, emailed, telephoned, and Zoomed with friends in higher-education leadership. Current and former heads of both research universities and liberal-arts colleges confirmed my intuition: Well-resourced and prestigious small colleges are less exposed in almost every way to the crises that higher ed faces.

To dig deeper, I decided to embark on a fact-finding mission in the guise of a traditional college tour. In November, I went to visit four elite liberal-arts colleges—Amherst, Davidson, Smith, and Vassar—where I joined prospective students and their parents for their campus tours, sat in on classes, and spoke with undergraduates, professors, and administrators. Might schools such as these emerge as the accidental winners of the war on universities?

I came to Amherst College too late in the autumn to observe peak foliage, but amber and ocher remnants still spread across the Pioneer Valley in western Massachusetts. This is the scene Emily Dickinson, a local resident, would have taken in before composing the lines, “The maple wears a gayer scarf, / The field a scarlet gown.”

My tour began at the Colonial Revival residence that serves as the school’s admissions office, but we soon arrived in the new science building, a modern structure with oddball green furnishings. Nate Scharf, our sophomore guide, sat us down and gestured toward a small classroom where he had taken a psychology class. At a typical research university, an undergraduate course like this would meet inside a lecture hall, perhaps with separate breakout sections for discussion led by graduate students. But neither Scharf nor any of his classmates had ever been exposed to this scenario—because Amherst, like most liberal-arts colleges, has no graduate students.

No graduate students: The American public may not fully grasp the implications of this statement. At a university, grad students may end up leading class discussions, but that’s only part of the story. Their presence on a campus telegraphs a more important truth: that in terms of mission, teaching undergrads comes second to research.

And at most universities, grad students play a crucial role within the research system: They perform the frontline work of science. Faculty members get federal grants, which are used to pay for doctoral students, who in turn serve as laboratory staff. Professors’ feeling of worth and productivity may be a function of how many doctoral students they advise—because that helps determine how many studies they can carry out, how many papers they can publish, and what sorts of new grants they can win to keep the process going. This endless competition is a major feature of the modern university—whether it’s an elite private school (such as Princeton or Duke), a public flagship (such as the University of Michigan or UC Berkeley), or a land-grant institution (such as Texas A&M or Virginia Tech).

A school like Amherst, though, which has no doctoral programs whatsoever, is free of the rat race of research productivity and expenditure. As these colleges like to point out, that’s good for undergrads, because faculty must focus on education. The lack of doctoral research programs also makes the schools more resilient to bullying from Washington. In 2025, the Trump administration made a point of suspending hundreds of millions of dollars in research grants to Columbia, Harvard, Northwestern, and other schools. It also threatened to impose a tighter limit on what are called “indirect costs”—the portion of each grant that covers all the broader costs of running a large enterprise for research. With so much funding endangered all at once, targeted universities had little choice but to negotiate—which is to say, to accede to some portion of the Trump administration’s demands.

At Amherst, this level of pressure simply couldn’t be applied. In 2024, the college took in around $3 million from all of its federal research grants put together. (For comparison: Washington University in St. Louis, where I teach, received $731 million that year from the National Institutes of Health alone.) Christopher Durr, an associate professor of chemistry, told me that his research is “designed to be done mostly in-house,” by which he means without external funding, and with the help of undergraduates. He studies biodegradable plastics in a lab that is mostly funded by the college itself, and he gets no research money at all from the federal government. Settling into an Eames-style chair in his office, I asked him what indirect-cost rate Amherst applies to its grants, and he said he didn’t know—an innocence that would be unheard of at a research university.

The research that can be done at a small liberal-arts college, with its more modest labs and equipment, is necessarily constrained. Even with Amherst’s generosity, Durr said “there’s a limit” to how far he can push his research. In truth, the most important scientific and medical discoveries aren’t likely to be made at a place like Amherst or Smith, the nearby women’s college, which tend to pay their own students to work on faculty research. But this need not be a limitation for undergraduates. The conditions that produce landmark discoveries are not necessarily the same ones that produce a serious education.

Perched along the shores of North Carolina’s Lake Norman, in the Charlotte suburbs at the northern edge of Mecklenburg County, Davidson College’s location is a crossroads for red and blue America. In the last election, two-thirds of Mecklenburg’s voters chose Kamala Harris; just a mile up the road, in Iredell County, two-thirds of voters went for Donald Trump.

Connor Hines, the current student-body president and a senior majoring in political science, is a self-described moderate conservative who grew up in the area. He told me that he chose to come to Davidson in part because its students are able to disagree with one another in thoughtful ways. His good friend Nina Worley, an educational-studies major who was raised in Harlem, said the same. “I knew that to be a good advocate for education policy, I needed to meet a Republican for the first time,” Worley told me. She and Hines do not see eye to eye on everything—the two do not agree, for example, on the policies of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But they said they carry out that disagreement with respect.

According to higher education’s many critics on the right, elite universities have tried to stifle disagreement; allegedly they’re pushing students into echo chambers instead of broadening their minds. The Trump administration made this accusation central to its war on research universities: With billions of dollars in withheld grants as leverage, it initially pressured nine institutions into signing an agreement, called the “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,” that would commit them to “fostering a vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus” and protecting conservative viewpoints.

In the meantime, under local pressure, reactionary speech suppression is taking hold at public universities: Many schools, including Auburn and the University of Michigan, have shut down their DEI offices; Texas A&M censored courses based on race and gender content; and Indiana University halted the print edition of the student newspaper, an act its journalists said amounted to censorship. Some private schools, including Columbia, Northwestern, and Cornell, have struck deals to restore funding that variously included provisions regarding civil-rights standards, disciplinary processes, DEI rubrics in admissions and hiring, and policies related to sex and gender identity.

Davidson, which, like Amherst, is far less exposed than research universities to the threat of withheld money, has not been explicitly asked to sign the compact. (Nor have any other liberal-arts schools, including the ones I visited.) Chris Marsicano, an associate professor of education studies who had introduced me to Hines and Worley, told me that the school was way ahead of the national conversation on campus dialogue in any case. In 2019, it created a Deliberative Citizenship Initiative, which runs programming to help students and faculty engage on issues about which disagreement is likely, such as immigration and border control. “We’re the hipsters of civil discourse,” Marsicano said. “We were doing it before it was cool.”

Certainly these sorts of efforts can be found at lots of universities: Ohio State has a Civil Discourse for Citizenship initiative, for instance, and WashU has just launched an Ordered Liberty Project, which includes associated coursework on the topic of “disagreement.” But they may be most likely to succeed when they’re applied to smaller student bodies, like Davidson’s. At lunch in the school’s campus commons, I watched President Douglas Hicks greet a dozen students by name. My tour guide explained that students and faculty tend to mingle there; in fact, they can’t avoid it, because everyone eats in the same place. Some might find this stifling or claustrophobic, but being forced to live together day by day may also stimulate openness and mutual respect. “You can’t hide,” Hicks told me.

At a small liberal-arts college, where a cohort may number fewer than 500 people, admissions officers can also take a stronger hand in assembling a group of students who match the institution’s culture and its vibe while also having very different backgrounds. And the fact that almost everyone at a small liberal-arts college tends to live on campus, or very close to it, adds to the sense of intimacy. “It’s just much easier for me to get to know faculty here, much easier for me to get to know students, much easier for me to hear what’s on their minds,” Amherst’s president, Michael Elliott, told me.

One effect of this, he said, is that professors actually show up to faculty meetings to talk about the future of their institution. They participate in budgeting conversations, debate the creation of majors, and approve new courses. This is decidedly not the norm at many larger universities, where professors may not see these meetings as a core part of the job, and where administrators can ignore them altogether. (Last year, Northwestern reached a settlement with the Trump administration despite 98 percent of its voting faculty having recommended otherwise.) Elliott admits that all of this faculty participation can make the college move more slowly in decision making. But done right, faculty governance is a form of healthy campus discourse, too.

Perhaps no threat to higher ed is more acute than the recent, rapid spread of generative AI. “It’s just about crushed me,” one college teacher told me in the spring of 2023. “I fell in love with teaching, and I have loved my time in the classroom, but with ChatGPT, everything feels pointless.”

The remarkable test-taking, paper-writing power of AI is hardly under control at liberal-arts colleges such as Amherst or Davidson. But in my conversations with students and faculty, I witnessed a struggle to understand and respond to it with greater earnestness and complexity than I have encountered elsewhere in higher education. In my experience, students and faculty at research universities tend to have a Manichaean view of the technology: Either AI is an existential threat to be cast out, or a vital tool to be embraced as a professional virtue. Little room is left for nuance, which means that little progress can be made on shaping policy.

Davidson prides itself on having an unusually deliberate honor code. (Students I spoke with said this code is taken so seriously that they can leave their belongings anywhere on campus without fear that they will be stolen.) But the seductions of ChatGPT are hard to resist, and Marsicano noted that the college has seen an increase in code violations due to AI. That sounded like less of a problem here than elsewhere, though. If the students are availing themselves of the technology, then at least they appear to be doing so with some reservations.

Hines told me that he uses AI tools, though not for academic work. Worley said she’s avoided AI so far, because “I’m still struggling with what makes me comfortable about it and what doesn’t.” At Davidson, each professor can set their own approach to AI in the classroom, but that can be confusing. In the meantime, Worley and her roommates ponder what the rules should be. They ask, for instance: If it’s now okay to have AI write your emails for you, why is that okay? And they talk about AI data centers’ environmental costs. “Everyone’s wrestling with it,” she said.

Learning how to wrestle with an issue like AI, which is ambiguous and undecided, is the whole point of an education undertaken in the liberal tradition. It’s also made easier in a context where faculty-to-student ratios can be much smaller than they are at even elite research universities. (At a school like Davidson or Amherst, some classrooms will contain just a handful of students and a professor—a scenario in which siphoning work through Claude would not be easy.) Carina Cole, a Vassar media-studies student, told me that a supportive culture on campus also makes it possible to treat AI with greater care. Her fellow students are more likely to ask one another for help than turn to technology, she said. But Worley admitted that the situation feels fragile no matter what: “I’m holding on for dear life.”

At Amherst, I sat down with Matthew McGann, the dean of admission and financial aid. I asked how his school stacked up against the nation’s most prestigious universities. If a student also gains admission to Yale, do they go there instead? “They do,” he said. Amherst has a sterling reputation, but it still cannot compete against a famous Ivy.

The relative obscurity of even the best small liberal-arts colleges may be helping them to avoid the Trump administration’s war on higher ed. But that doesn’t mean that they’re immune from any risk of being targeted. Haverford College, in Pennsylvania, for example, has been made the subject of a civil-rights investigation for allegedly failing to address anti-Semitic harassment against Jewish students. (This is the same charge, and the same government action, that has been directed or threatened against Columbia, UCLA, Stanford, Cornell, Rutgers, and many other big universities.) Haverford may not rely on the federal government for giant research grants, but even just defending itself against investigation would be costly, as would, say, losing federal Pell Grants that subsidize low-income students.

Small colleges’ endowments could also be attacked, even if the schools are never targeted specifically. In 2025, Congress voted to increase the tax on endowment income, which private colleges and universities draw on for financial aid, from 1.4 percent to as much as 8 percent. (The wealthiest liberal-arts colleges spend a large portion of their endowment earnings to fund students who can’t afford to spend up to $100,000 a year to attend.) For the moment, institutions with fewer than 3,000 tuition-paying students—which means most liberal-arts colleges—are exempted from this increase, so their budgets remain untouched. But that could change.

Then there is the nagging question of practicality. Even if you believe that a liberal-arts college offers the best education, going to school to learn how to think might seem like a luxury today. In the end, you’ll still need to earn some kind of living. If the paths for getting there—which may include postgraduate study in a doctoral program or professional school—are diminishing, then college itself will follow suit.

Still, after spending several weeks on my tour of wealthy, liberal-arts colleges, I grew to think that the pitch they’re making to prospective students and their parents for the fall of 2026 was convincing. All things considered, when the time comes, I might rather see my own preteen daughter attend a school like Amherst or Davidson, Smith or Vassar, than a research university such as my own. The form of higher ed that they provide seems poised to be the most resilient in the years to come.

In a way, that resilience may pass on to the students who attend them. On my last night in western Massachusetts, I was set up to have dinner with a group of graduating Amherst seniors. By all measures, these were tremendously successful young adults. Hedley Lawrence-Apfelbaum intends to complete a fellowship at the University of Oxford on his way to Harvard Law. Ayres Warren, who has already published a journal article on breast-cancer disparities, will pursue a career in environmental health-care management. Shane Dillon is plotting out a career in politics. All three of them told me they were worried about their futures—not because they had attended Amherst instead of Yale or Emory or Michigan State, but because the world seems so uncertain on the whole.

These seniors weren’t panicking, though—this was very clear. “We’ll see,” Dillon said when I asked what was next, what he feared, and what he hoped for. I’ve known a lot of brilliant undergraduates during the course of my career at research universities. Some have become wealthy in business; others have become famous; still more have made the world better through research and invention. But Dillon and the other students whom I met during my college tour struck me as being unusually attuned to the facts of their predicament. They were already living in the thickness of their own lives, aware of who they are and not just what they might become. They seemed to understand, by virtue of the education they’d received, that uncertainty is to be expected, and that the future lasts a long time.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Bruce Springsteen's song 'Streets of Minneapolis' is a direct protest against federal law enforcement and the Trump administration, drawing parallels to historical protest anthems like 'Ohio.' While the critic finds the lyrics blunt and the music formulaic, the song is noted for its raw anger and its place within the long tradition of American protest rock.

        <hr/>
        The first few strums of Bruce Springsteen’s new song make you feel like you’re in for, well, a Bruce Springsteen song—a rollicking sing-along about rough-and-tumble but ultimately hopeful times in some troubled American town. And this song, “Streets of Minneapolis,” is exactly that.

It’s also a response to ICE’s bloody record in Minneapolis. It excoriates, by name, Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller, and “Trump’s federal thugs.” It memorializes Alex Pretti and Renee Good—the Americans killed by federal agents—and the “whistles and phones” still in use by demonstrators. The song’s considerable power lies in the way it transposes a classic, even hoary, mode of protest rock into the present. Springsteen conveys that we’re living through a time that will be sung about for years to come, and that the future depends a lot on what we do in this moment.

Springsteen has made many protest songs: the inequality elegy of “The Ghost of Tom Joad,” the post-9/11 rallying cry of “The Rising,” the Vietnam-veteran anthem “Born in the U.S.A.” As a reaction to law-enforcement overreach, “Minneapolis” especially recalls Springsteen’s 2000 song “American Skin (41 Shots),” about the police killing of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed Black man. And across his catalog, Springsteen’s concrete lyricism and drawling vocals channel folk music’s titans of protest, Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie. Here, those influences are worn proudly, ringing out in a buoyant harmonica solo.

But the song that “Minneapolis” most evokes is Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young’s 1970 touchstone, “Ohio,” recorded after the National Guard killed four students during a protest at Kent State University. “Tin soldiers and Nixon coming,” sang Neil Young in a scene-setting verse; “King Trump’s private army from the DHS,” sings Springsteen now. Here we are again, late in a culture war, with a champion of a supposed silent majority breaking norms and pushing polarization. Here we are again as armed agents menace civilians. “Ohio” crystallized a moment that had already captured national attention, but it also invited listeners to suss out where they stand. “What if you knew her and found her dead on the ground?” Young asked. “How can you run when you know?”

“Streets of Minneapolis” doesn’t bother with questions. Its mission is to rouse in the manner of drinking songs, which its sloping melodies and gang-sung harmonies evoke. Springsteen has sounded bitter before, and mournful, but never this purely angry. His voice slithers and spits, reserving extra phlegm for the names of Donald Trump and his allies. Grace and warmth peek out in strategic moments as well, like the chorus’s oh-so-slowly intoned slant rhymes: the words Minneapolis, stranger in our midst, and—the poignance of this one took a moment to understand—26.

Twenty-six as in 2026: the exotic-sounding name of this new year in a decade that remains baffling more than halfway through. Who expected to be living this far in the future and yet trapped in the same old story? One can trace Minneapolis back not only to Kent State but also to the civil-rights movement, and to the labor riots and fascist takeovers abroad that inspired Guthrie. The details change, but the fundamental shape of the struggle remains stubbornly familiar: On one side, gun-toting agents of the establishment; on the other, advocates for the freedom of the less powerful. The clashes result in deaths that get called “senseless” but take on enduring symbolic weight thanks to songs just like this one.

To be clear, “Minneapolis” is not “Ohio,” a paradigm-pushing masterpiece. Springsteen’s language—“thugs,” “King Trump,” “they trample on our rights”—is more Facebook post than poetry. The wordplay about fire and ice and ICE is cheap. The music is heavy-footed and formulaic. The immediate acclaim for it makes the critic in me a little resentful: Artists of all kinds routinely make songs engaging with their times, but so often these days, prestige is reserved for the music that copies the Boomers’ glory days. However, as this song suggests, that era shines in the public memory for a reason.

After sitting with “Streets of Minneapolis,” I tried again to get into Jesse Welles, a 33-year-old folk singer who makes scathingly anti-Trump songs with titles such as “Join ICE” and “No Kings.” Musically, he imitates Dylan and Springsteen to the point of parody. The way the media and rock institutions have embraced him—he’s played Stephen Colbert, performed with Joan Baez, and is up for four Grammys this year—implies that he is the great hope for musical resistance, but his blend of modern buzzwords with Woodstock aesthetics has struck my ear as injuriously hokey.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> The article explores how university faculty are increasingly using generative AI to streamline time-consuming administrative tasks like drafting recommendation letters, grant proposals, and syllabi. While initially concerned about student cheating, professors are now leveraging tools like ChatGPT to overcome the 'blank page' problem and handle formulaic work, allowing them to focus more on the human and heartfelt aspects of their professional responsibilities.

        <hr/>
        Early spring greened outside the picture window in the faculty club. I was lunching with a group of fellow professors, and, as happens these days when we assemble, generative artificial intelligence was discussed. Are your students using it? What are you doing to prevent cheating? Heads were shaken in chagrin as iced teas were sipped for comfort.

But then, one of my colleagues wondered: Could he use AI to generate a reference letter for a student? Faculty write loads of these every year, in support of applications for internships, fellowships, industry jobs, graduate school, university posts. They all tend to be more or less the same, yet they also somehow take a lot of time, and saving some of it might be nice. Other, similar ideas spilled out quickly. Maybe ChatGPT could help with grant proposals. Or syllabi, even? The ideas seemed revelatory, but also scandalous.

Scandalous because we faculty, like all faculty everywhere, were drawn into an educators’ panic about AI over the winter. When ChatGPT began to spread around the internet last December, fears of its impact gripped our profession: The college essay is dead! It’s the end of high-school English! Students will let computers do their homework! Task forces were launched to investigate. Syllabi were updated with academic-integrity warnings. Op-eds were written. And now, in the faculty club, we professors were musing over how to automate our own assignments?

Large language models can be pretty bad at generating accurate facts and knowledge. But they’re pretty darn good at creating plausible renditions of the work output you don’t care that much about. It is here, where exhaustion meets nuisance, that AI brings students and faculty together.

Take reference letters. ChatGPT can’t explain why you would (or wouldn’t) recommend a specific individual for a specific role, but it can give you a detailed template. A University of Texas professor I spoke with uses AI as a starting point for both lecture content and reference-letter writing. “Quite generic,” the faculty member reported, “but then the average letter is … ?” I’m withholding the faculty member’s name to protect this person from feared reprisal. A shortcut like this can easily be seen as shirking work, but with so much work to do, maybe something has to give. ChatGPT seemed to cut the time involved in writing letters by half.

“A dirty secret of academe is that most professors have a cache of letters separated into different categories,” says Matt Huculak, another AI-using academic and the head of advanced research services at the University of Victoria libraries. They’ll typically have folders full of excellent, good, and average ones, which can be adjusted and repurposed as appropriate. But Huculak wondered if AI might help break that chain, especially for top students. So he asked ChatGPT to write an “excellent” reference letter, and then, instead of using it as a template, he treated it as an enemy. He opened the ChatGPT output in one window and tried to compose the very opposite of what he saw: an anti-formulaic recommendation letter. “What I wrote ended up feeling like the most ‘human’ and heartfelt letter I’ve written in a long time,” he told me. The student won a prestigious scholarship at Cambridge.

Nothing was stopping Huculak from applying the same technique to one of his own formulaic letters, striving to produce its inverse. But having a machine “lay the genre bare,” as Huculak put it, somehow gave him the comfort to play around with the material. It also broke him of the terror of the blank page.

Stephanie Kane, who teaches at George Mason University, also told me that ChatGPT upends the difficulty of creating something out of nothing. When she began developing a syllabus for a new class, she asked ChatGPT to generate ideas, “kind of like a rubber duck that talks back.” Kane quickly discovered that ChatGPT can’t be trusted to suggest readings that actually exist, but it could suggest topics or concepts. Kane also asked colleagues on social media, as faculty tend to do, but that burdens her colleagues. “I think ChatGPT was better, honestly. It doesn’t judge, so I could ask any questions I want without being worried of sounding silly or unprepared,” she said.

Huculak and Kane hoped to overcome platitude, but Hank Blumenthal, a film producer who has worked in both industry and academia, looked to ChatGPT to gain more insight into cliché. Having been passed over for academic jobs in his area, Blumenthal wondered if his required position statement on diversity, equity, and inclusion might have been too unusual for their tastes. “My current diversity statement is about all the movies I produced where I hired Black, Asian, female, diverse crew, directors, actors,” he told me. “Still, I think schools want something else.” Given what ChatGPT can do, Blumenthal said, “I was looking to see what might be the expected discourse.”

Blumenthal doesn’t want ChatGPT to take a diversity position on his behalf. Rather, he hopes that it can help him conform to expectations. “I sought the differences between what I had done and the expected versions,” he told me. Likewise, an American University professor I spoke with copped to using AI to generate the formal “assessment criteria” that now must be a part of course and degree proposals, for example. “It did a great job at sounding like the sort of thing someone evaluating a course without knowing anything about the field would want to hear,” the professor said. The generated material was good enough to make it into the actual proposal. (I granted the professor anonymity so that the proposals would not be penalized for incorporating computer-generated text.)

A common lament about large language models holds that, having been trained on piles of existing material, they can’t provide originality. But a professor isn’t often charged with saying something truly new. Much of what we do all day is office work: writing letters, processing forms, compiling reports. AI can tame that labor, or at least offer a feeling of superiority over it.

        Updated at 5:49 p.m. ET on February 10, 2025

“I personally think that the post–World War II system of big research universities funded heavily by the government will not continue.” That’s how one professor at a big state research university responded when I asked how he was feeling about our shared profession. That system is the cornerstone of U.S. higher education—at Harvard or Princeton, yes, but also the University of Michigan and Texas A&M. The research university has helped establish the meaning of “college” as Americans know it. But that meaning may now be up for grabs.

In the past two weeks, higher ed has been hit by a series of startling and, in some cases, potentially illegal budget cuts. First came a total freeze of federal grants and loans (since blocked, perhaps ineffectually, by two federal judges), then news that the National Science Foundation, which pays for research in basic, applied, social, and behavioral science as well as engineering, could have its funding cut by two-thirds. On Friday night, the National Institutes of Health, which provides tens of billions of dollars in research funding every year, announced an even more momentous change: According to an official notice and a post from the agency’s X account, it would be slashing the amount that it pays out in grants for administrative costs, effective as of this morning.

This latest move may sound prosaic: The Trump administration has merely put a single cap on what are called “indirect costs,” or overhead. But it’s a very big deal. Think of these as monies added to each research grant to defray the cost of whatever people, equipment, buildings, and other resources might be necessary to carry out the scientific work. If the main part of a grant is meant to pay for the salaries of graduate students and postdocs, for example, along with the materials those people will be using in experiments, then the overhead might account for the equipment that they use, and the lab space where they work, and the staff members who keep their building running. The amount allotted by the NIH for all these latter costs has varied in the past, but for some universities it was set at more than 60 percent of each grant. Now, for as long as the Trump administration’s new rule is in place, that rate will never go higher than 15 percent. Andrew Nixon, the director of communications for the Department of Health and Human Services, told me the administration takes the view that it could force universities to pay back any overhead above this rate that was received in the past. “We have currently chosen not to do so to ease the implementation of the new rate,” he said.

In practical terms, this means that every $1 million grant given to a school could have been transformed, at the stroke of midnight, into one that’s worth about $700,000. Imagine if your income, or the revenue for your business, was cut by nearly 30 percent, all at once. At the very least, you’d have a cash-flow problem. Something would have to give, and fast. You’d need to find more money, or cut costs, or fire people, or cease certain operations—or do all of those things at once.

It’s safe to assume that those consequences now affect every American research university. Some campuses stand to lose $100 million a year or more. Schools with billions of dollars in endowments, tens of thousands of students, or high tuition rates will all be affected. Just as your family has to pay bills or your business has to pay salaries, so do universities. “I think we could lose $1 million to $2 million a week,” one top university administrator, who declined to be named to avoid political scrutiny, told me. But the loss could also be much larger. Administrators can only guess right now. They don’t yet know how to figure out the impact of this cut, because they’ve never been through anything like it.

Within an hour of this article’s initial publication, a federal judge in Massachusetts put a hold on the cap on indirect costs, just as the freeze on federal funds was quickly stopped in court. (Stuart Buck, who has a law degree and is the executive director of the Good Science Project, a think tank focused on improving science policy, had told me that the cut probably wouldn’t pass legal scrutiny.) But whatever happens next, a jolt has already been administered to research universities, with immediate effects. And the sudden, savage cuts are setting up these institutions for more punishment to come. A 75-year tradition of academic research in America, one that made the nation’s schools the envy of the world, has been upset.

The “post–World War II system” of research that the state-school professor mentioned can be traced back almost entirely to one man: Vannevar Bush. His diverse accomplishments included his vision, published in The Atlantic, for a networked information system that would inspire hypertext and the World Wide Web. In 1941, Bush became the first director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, funded by Congress to carry out research for military, industrial, medical, and other purposes, including that which led to the atom bomb.

Universities in America received little public-research funding at the time. Bush thought that should change. In 1945, he put out an influential report, “Science: The Endless Frontier,” arguing that the federal government should pay for basic research in peacetime, with decisions about what to fund being made not by bureaucrats, but by the scientific community itself. Bush advocated for a new kind of organization to fund science in universities with federal money, which was realized in 1950 as the National Science Foundation. Then his model spread to the NIH and beyond.

Money from these agencies fueled the growth of universities in the second half of the 20th century. To execute their now-expanded research mission, universities built out graduate programs and research labs. The work helped them attract scientists—many of them the best in their field—who might otherwise have worked in industry, and who could also teach the growing number of undergraduates. The research university was and is not the only model for college life in America, but during this period, it became the benchmark.

Now many university professors and researchers believe that this special fusion of research and teaching is at risk. “I feel lost,” a research scientist at a top-five university who works on climate and data science told me. (She asked not to be named, because she is concerned about being targeted online.) Like others I spoke with this week, she expressed not only fear but anger and despair. She feels lost in her own career, but also as an American scientist whose identity is bound up in the legacy of Bush’s endless frontier. It’s “like I don’t know my own country anymore,” she said. Even though her work isn’t funded by the NIH, she worries that similar cuts to indirect costs will come to the NSF and other agencies. She said that her salary and benefits are paid for entirely by federal grants. If money for overhead gets held up, even temporarily, the work could get stopped and the lab shut down—even at a wealthy and prestigious school like hers.

Others I spoke with had similar reactions. Bérénice Benayoun, a gerontologist at the University of Southern California who studies how male and female immune systems respond differently to aging, has already heard that the NIH overhead cut might lead to salary freezes and layoffs at her institution. The people working in administrative, purchasing, and shared-services roles are all funded by this pool of money, she said, so they might be the first to lose their job. Mark Peifer, a cell biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, worries that his doctoral students and research techs might not get their paycheck if the lab’s accounting staff, which is also paid from overhead, are let go.

Both Benayoun and Peifer suggested that, in addition to harming their friends and co-workers, these changes would affect the pace of science overall. Some administrative duties might be handed off to faculty. “We’ll be able to do less science and train fewer talented people,” Benayoun said. Support for doctoral tuition—often paid from grants—could also be at risk, which would mean fewer graduate students doing lab work. That would slow down research, too. Some of these consequences might arrive “within weeks,” she told me.

Peifer told me he feels “both devastated and defiant.” His research relies on advanced confocal microscopes that are priced as high as $1 million each. Indirect costs on grants help a school like UNC invest in that equipment, along with laboratory cold rooms, electricity bills, and other, more mundane needs. Universities also use overhead to cover start-up costs, sometimes millions of dollars’ worth, for setting up new faculty with labs. Those kinds of investments would also be endangered if the NIH overhead cut is maintained. “It will mean the end of biomedical science in the United States,” Peifer said.

Biomedical science is probably not about to end. But Peifer and his peers do have reason to worry. Many scientists have devoted most of their lives to doing research, and they’ve done so in a system that is designed, through its structure and incentives, to wind them up. Even as their fields have grown more crowded over time, and grant funding more competitive, they may be pressured by their universities to spend more money on their work. The schools compete for rankings, status, talent, and students based in part on the number of dollars that they dole out in doing research, a metric known as “research expenditures.” Given all the pressure on professors to win more grants, and pay more bills, even just the prospect of a major funding cut can feel like a cataclysm.

The one that kicked in and then was stopped today may not be coming back. When the first Trump administration tried to limit overhead on NIH grants in its 2018 budget proposal, its plan didn’t work. Congress rejected the idea, and the NIH appropriations language that lawmakers adopted in response is very clear: Indirect-cost rates cannot be touched. The fact that the administration went ahead and changed them anyway suggests “no theory of reform,” Stuart Buck said.

At the very least, the cut to indirect costs has precipitated a short-lived funding crisis, of a type that should now be familiar to American scientists. George Porter, a computer-science professor at UC San Diego whose work focuses on how to reduce the energy required to run big data centers, has been through similar scares. In 2017, the Department of Energy briefly halted payment on a $12 million grant he was awarded after the administration sought (unsuccessfully) to eliminate the agency that funded it, Porter told me. Government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019 created further obstacles to his getting access to federal grants. “I’ve been trying to tell people that science funding is very fragile for some time,” he said.

But after most of a century of success and support from the federal government, research universities and their faculties may have become inured to risk. One computer-science professor who declined to be named because he was coming up for a performance review told me that few of his colleagues believed that anything would really change that much because of Donald Trump. “Everyone was wondering whether their grant funding would be delayed. The idea that it might be canceled, or that two-thirds of the NSF budget may be cut, just wasn’t something anyone believed could happen,” he said.

Now the sense of dread has reached even those in computer science, where grant money tends to come from other sources—the NSF, the Department of Defense, NASA, the Department of Energy. Any budget cuts brought on by the NIH could be felt by everyone across the university. “Suddenly there are some very serious rumors going around,” the computer-science professor said, including the possibility that faculty in his department would have to pay some of their grant funds back to the university to make up for the total shortfall. Even university leaders seem surprised. “This literally breaks everything,” one senior administrator at a major public university told me after learning about the NIH overhead cut. “What are they doing?”

If this cut is reinstated, or if new ones follow, universities will need to figure out how to respond. Some might press researchers to make up the deficit with future research funds, a practice that would make an already hard job even harder. Some might choose to invest more of their endowment or tuition proceeds in research, a choice that could cut financial aid, making college even less affordable. Big state schools could try to appeal to legislatures for increased funding.

Even if they head off a crisis, other institutions of higher ed might suffer in their stead. Nicholas Creel is a business-law professor at Georgia College & State University, a small, public liberal-arts college. Schools like his focus on teaching, which might suggest that it’s immune to the sort of government cuts that would be catastrophic for a large research university. But Creel worries that his college could be in trouble too, if the state government responds by shifting money to the bigger institutions. “That’ll mean less funding for schools like mine, schools that operate on a budget that those major research universities would consider a rounding error.”

In the meantime, the Trump administration’s cuts aren’t even set up to make research more efficient. The real problem, Robert Butera, an engineering professor and the chief research operations officer at the Georgia Institute of Technology, told me, is compliance bloat. Buck agrees. More changes to the regulations and policies affecting federal grants have accrued since 2016 than they did in the 25 years prior, and universities must hire staff to satisfy new demands. In other words, the federal government’s own rules have helped create the rising overhead costs that the same government is now weaponizing against higher ed.

Inside universities, faculty members squabble about the details. Many scientists would agree that overhead is too high—but only because they perceive that money as being taken from their own grant funds. Administrators say that overhead never covers costs, even at the rates that were in place until last week. Despite all of this, few of those I’ve spoken with in the past few days seem to have considered making any lasting change to how universities are run.

Maybe this was never about efficiency. American confidence in higher education has plummeted: Last year, a Gallup poll reported that 36 percent of Americans had “a great deal or quite a lot” of confidence in higher ed, a figure that had reached nearly 60 percent as recently as 2015; 32 percent of respondents said they had “very little or no” confidence in the sector, up from just 10 percent 10 years ago. These changes don’t have much to do with scientific research. According to Gallup, those who have turned against universities cite the alleged “brainwashing” of students, the irrelevance of what is being taught, and the high cost of education. Destroying American university research does not directly target any of these issues. (It could very well result in even steeper tuition.) But it does send a message: The public is alienated from the university’s mission and feels shut out from the benefits it supposedly provides.

Scientists, locked away in labs doing research and scrabbling for grants, may not have been prepared to hear this. The climate and data scientist, for one, simply couldn’t believe that Americans wouldn’t want the research that she and others perform. “I just can’t understand how so many people don’t understand that this is valuable, needed work,” she said.

But now may not be the perfect time to make appeals to the value and benefit of scientific research. The time to do that was during the years in which public trust was lost. In a way, this error traces back to the start of modern federally funded research on college campuses. In “Science: The Endless Frontier,” Vannevar Bush appealed to the many benefits of scientific progress, citing penicillin, radar, insulin, air-conditioning, rayon, and plastics, among other examples. He also put scientists on a pedestal. Universities make the same appeals and value judgments to this day. Cutting back their research funding is not in the nation’s interests. Neither is insisting on the status quo.

        <hr/>
        The start of spring semester is a hopeful time on college campuses. Students fill the quads and walkways, wearing salmon shorts or strappy tank tops. Music plays; Frisbees fly. As a career academic, I have been a party to this catalog-cover scene for more than 30 years running. It looks made-up, but it is real. Every year in the United States, almost 20 million people go to college, representing every race, ethnicity, and social class. This is college in America—or it has been for a long time.

But college life as we know it may soon come to an end. Since January, the Trump administration has frozen, canceled, or substantially cut billions of dollars in federal grants to universities. Johns Hopkins has had to fire more than 2,000 workers. The University of California has frozen staff hiring across all 10 of its campuses. Many other schools have cut back on graduate admissions. And international students and faculty have been placed at such high risk of detainment, deportation, or imprisonment that Brown University advised its own to avoid any travel outside the country for the foreseeable future.

Higher education is in chaos, and professors and administrators are sounding the alarm. The targeting of Columbia University, where $400 million in federal grants and contracts have been canceled in retribution for its failure to address campus anti-Semitism and unruly protests against the war in Gaza, has inspired particular distress. Such blunt coercion, Princeton University President Christopher Eisgruber wrote in The Atlantic earlier this month, amounts to “the greatest threat to American universities since the Red Scare.” In The New York Times, the Yale English professor Meghan O’Rourke called it and related policies “an attack on the conditions that allow free thought to exist.”

Those assessments are correct, but they’re also incomplete. So are the many paeans to the social and economic benefits of university research that schools have posted in the past two months. Yes, academic freedom is at stake, along with scientific progress. But the government’s attacks also threaten something far more tangible to future college students and their parents. The entire undergraduate experience at residential four-year schools—the brochure-ready college life that you may once have experienced yourself, and to which your children may aspire—is itself at risk of ruination.

Few administrators have talked about this risk in public, but they take a different tone in private as they try to figure out how broken budgets can be fixed. I’ve spent the past month discussing the government’s campaign to weaken higher learning with current and former college presidents, provosts, deans, faculty, and staff. And in the course of these informal, sometimes panicked text exchanges, emails, and phone calls, I’ve come to understand that the damage to our educational system could be worse than the public comprehends—and that calamity could arrive sooner than people expect.

Any one of the Trump administration’s attacks on research universities, let alone all of them together, could upend the college experience for millions of Americans. What’s at stake is far from trivial: Forget the Frisbees on the quad; think of what it means to go to college in this country. Think of the middle-class ideal that has persisted for most of a century: earning a degree and starting a career, yes, but also moving away from home, testing limits, joining new communities, becoming an adult.

This might all be changing for fancy private schools and giant public universities alike. If you, or your son, or your daughter, are in college now, or are planning to enroll in the years ahead, you should be worried.

The familiar image of campus life was well established by the early 20th century. Whether a student was enrolled at Yale or Ohio State, they could expect to find the same mix of fraternities, coursework, and college sports; the same commingling of parties and protests.

At first that experience was limited to the wealthy. The American approach to higher ed had arisen from a melting pot of influences, some homegrown and others pulled from overseas. U.S. schools combined the practicality of land-grant institutions with the research focus of German universities. They borrowed also from British residential colleges, adopting both pastoral campuses and an aristocratic temperament. But after World War II, U.S. higher education was transformed. It quickly spread into the middle class, and helped expand it. The GI Bill, among many other efforts by the government, made college more accessible. Federal funding for research turned the college campus into a source of valuable expertise, and the locus for its own, growing set of jobs. And the rise of the knowledge economy made the skills one learned in college more desirable for all. In 1940, only 5 percent of American adults had earned a bachelor’s degree. By 1960, 45 percent of high-school graduates were enrolled in college; by 1997, that figure reached 67 percent.

All of this seems natural to Americans, but it was, and is, an unusual way to handle higher learning. Elsewhere in the world, colleges are not defined as mediators between childhood and adulthood. They may not be specific places where a student “goes” (as in the common formulation “I went to college”) but rather sets of nondescript buildings interwoven with cities. Only in America could “college” refer to the amalgamation of a coming-of-age experience and a credentialing service, based in a planned community that was mainly built to facilitate scientific research but also provides diversion, dining, and professional-quality sporting events.

As this peculiar form of college life expanded, Americans became attached to it. Many meet their future spouses while in college, then settle down not far away from where they went to school. Many cheer for their alma mater’s teams on television. Many send their alma mater money every year. College life stretches far beyond the years they spend on campus. In a way, it even stretches beyond the people who take part in it directly. It imbues the culture.

But creating this experience has always been just one of many, varied roles that schools must play. Tens of thousands of people—undergraduates, but also faculty researchers, administrative staff, and residential-life personnel—might go about their business on a given campus unaware of the purposes of those with whom they cross paths. Amid this web of private factions and concerns, the day-to-day routines of students—their “college experience”—can be a fragile thing. One part of that experience is learning: going to class, pursuing a major, studying, doing research, and completing a thesis. But for the schools, the cost of providing these activities doesn’t balance with tuition revenue. In 2024, Columbia spent about $3 billion on instructional expenses, facilities costs, and operations. It took in about $1.75 billion in tuition and fees (such as room and board). The balance is made up by combining revenue from all across the campus, including money that comes in from its investments, for example, or from taking care of patients at its hospital.

That’s why even just the Trump administration’s first strike against its targets—a mass curtailment of science-research funding—could end up being felt by students right away. At research universities, federal grant dollars may represent 15 to 25 percent of overall budgets. Even schools with huge endowments—Columbia’s is about $15 billion, for example—lack an easy way to fill the gaps, because that money may be spread across thousands of accounts, each of which may have rules for how it can be spent. Cutting grant dollars so substantially and unexpectedly cannot be addressed in a way that limits the impacts of those cuts to research alone. Something else will have to give.

If a school’s athletics program is unable to cover its own costs, it may need to scale back spending on its sports teams. I’ve also heard from colleagues at schools across the country that construction projects have been scrapped, that study-abroad programs are getting canceled, and that career services face cuts. In the meantime, faculty hiring freezes such as those adopted at Harvard, the University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Vermont could mean that fewer classes will be taught next year.

And all of that could be just the beginning. About one-third of U.S. college students rely on federal Pell grants, a financial-aid program for low-income families. That program was already facing a shortfall, and now the Trump administration is dismantling the Department of Education and its Office of Federal Student Aid. The White House claims that financial-aid programs will be unaffected, but personnel who manage those grants, other loans, and federal work-study programs now say they are unable to carry out their duties effectively. For students who rely on these funds, even short disruptions could end their college aspirations.

In the meantime, the need-blind admissions and no-loan financial-aid packages that many elite private universities have adopted over the past decade may start to seem untenable amid a budget crunch; top schools could focus on enrolling students whose families can pay top dollar, at the expense of everybody else. Public universities could respond to their duress by bringing in more, higher-paying students from out of state. (That trend is preexisting, but it could get much worse.) And those who can’t afford the rising costs would be relegated to community colleges and online degrees—useful options, but far removed from the cherished image of American higher education.

The point is this: It’s not just research; all of the trappings of college life are potentially at risk, and soon. If the campus experience is able to survive, it may revert to a more elitist, century-old version of itself, where the sons and daughters of oligarchs are among the only students on its lawns.

Those who plan to study the humanities may have the most to lose. The speed and scale of funding cuts demand immediate action, one top administrator at a state flagship university told me, and that could put programs in English, natural languages, art history, and the like into the crosshairs.

Doctoral students in such fields are mostly paid out of general university funds, which means that their salaries could easily be reclaimed and used as filler for any budgetary holes. (In contrast, money tied to research grants must be spent in certain ways.) But these same grad students also teach large numbers of undergraduates, so losing them might cause a university’s course catalog to shrink. When fewer people are on campus to teach humanities classes, fewer humanities classes will be taught on campus.

It doesn’t help that the programs the White House seems most interested in targeting are found in the humanities. At Columbia, for example, the Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies has been stripped of its independence in accordance with one of the Trump administration’s specific demands. Another, related problem is that the humanities faculty are already alienated from the grant-funded research mission of the postwar university. Professors of cultural studies, or history, or the arts, have long seen themselves as critics of institutions, including the universities that employ them. At Columbia and elsewhere, the attack on research funding is only worsening intrafaculty resentments that have been felt for decades.

The present crisis also carries existential risks for general education, the part of college that requires students to take courses from across the curriculum. Some humanities departments with shrinking majors have been able to persevere in part by fostering humanistic education and scholarship on campus. But the state-flagship-university administrator said that just this sort of work may start to seem expendable, at a time when STEM investments are imperiled.

For the coming crop of undergraduates, cuts to the humanities, paired with the collapse of general education, would alter the foundations of their college experience. The long-standing idea that you go to college to discover your interests and abilities—to “find yourself”—would be replaced by a full embrace of professional training. Admittedly, this change has already been in the works for years, even at prestigious schools: The rising cost of college makes experimentation more difficult to justify, and students have grown more market-focused over time. Up until this point, even the most practical-minded among our undergraduates could still balance their vocational majors with breadth-giving minors, or see the benefits of merely a passing exposure to other fields and forms of inquiry. But now the university—a home for all knowledge, universally—could be forced to downsize its ambition.

“Our problem in part is a failure of imagination,” Lee Bollinger, a former Columbia president, told The Chronicle of Higher Education earlier this month. “We cannot get ourselves to see how this is going to unfold in its most frightening versions.” Now the most frightening versions are taking shape, as specters in the hallways of the ivory tower. Jobs are being cut, labs closed, building projects canceled. Faculty members may decide that their devotion to the pursuit of knowledge may not be worth the occupational risk. Those in science, medicine, and engineering whose grants have been withheld may start exiting for jobs abroad or in industry while they still can.

The college experience could very soon be one that bears little semblance to the classic picture. Your kid could end up on a campus with reduced student services and activities, aging rec centers, shrunken-down humanities departments, less prestigious faculty, and a class cohort that has been stripped of foreign students, and also thinned of anyone who happens not to be well-off. It could be a dreary and degraded version of the life at school that you may have once enjoyed yourself.

College students’ prospects would have been slightly better if the schools had seen this coming. Attacks on higher education are not new, but they have never been waged at this level and this speed. The government has at other times threatened to withhold funds from universities in order to enforce federal law, but such examples have been “rare and marginal,” David Labaree, a Stanford historian who studies higher education, told me. That may be why no university in America was prepared for this assault, and none seems ready to respond.

Neither the White House nor the Department of Education responded to a request for comment for this story. But even the most enthusiastic advocates for going after higher ed may have been surprised by the intensity of the Trump administration’s actions. Max Eden, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, suggested in an essay for the Washington Examiner in December that the new regime, and its then-presumptive education secretary, Linda McMahon, should increase the endowment tax on universities and threaten to withhold federal funds to bring them into line on matters of DEI and anti-Semitism. “To scare universities straight, McMahon should start by taking a prize scalp,” he wrote. “She should simply destroy Columbia University.”

Eden, who did not respond to a request to comment for this story, seemed to expect at least some kind of formal process for this scalping. In the bloodthirsty scenario laid out in his op-ed, McMahon would threaten Columbia before cutting off its funds. In fact, the Trump administration cut off those funds just days after McMahon had been confirmed, and before demands were even made. Then it pressed for multiple concessions before the school would have any opportunity at all to negotiate for the funding to restart. The Justice Department attorney Leo Terrell insisted that the school was still “not even close” to having its funds unfrozen; the next day, Columbia gave in.

For two months now, universities have had no idea what, if anything, might stave off further punishments. The state-flagship-university official I spoke with admitted to hoping that the problem will just go away. Perhaps one scalp will be enough, a message sent. For the moment, though, the demands themselves (whatever those might be for different schools) seem less destructive than the sudden, chaotic application of extreme financial leverage: “It’s all arson and no architecture,” the official said. Universities might be amenable to adjusting the terms of their relationship with the federal government, but they cannot do so quickly and under such duress. The Trump administration appears to want them not to talk, but to die.

As for future college students and their parents, the campus experience they expect—the one that generations of Americans took for granted—is no longer guaranteed. Here on campus, the undergraduates seem unaware of this alarming fact. The crisis for universities may be existential, but another spring is blooming on the quad. College has persisted for a whole lifetime in its present form, in a pastoral setting, underwritten by federally funded research, with football crowds cheering in the distance. Last week, a student in my course on artificial intelligence bounded into the lecture hall, full of energy and optimism. “How was your break?” she asked. I’d designed the class to give undergraduates from across the university insights into the changes AI might wreak on their future professions, but just then I found myself wondering more about the future of my own. Not because technology may disrupt it, but because my own government seems intent on destroying it. “It was good,” I said, faking a smile, unsure of what to say. “It was good.”

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, generative AI has rapidly transformed higher education from a source of academic confusion to a ubiquitous tool. Data indicates that a vast majority of undergraduates now use AI regularly, driven not necessarily by a desire to cheat, but by a pragmatic need to manage heavy workloads and a focus on professional achievement in a competitive job market.

        <hr/>
        A college senior returning to classes this fall has spent nearly their entire undergraduate career under the shadow—or in the embrace—of generative AI. ChatGPT first launched in November 2022, when that student was a freshman. As a department chair at Washington University in St. Louis, I witnessed the chaos it unleashed on campus. Students weren’t sure what AI could do, or which uses were appropriate. Faculty were blindsided by how effectively ChatGPT could write papers and do homework. College, it seemed to those of us who teach it, was about to be transformed.

But nobody thought it would happen this quickly. Three years later, the AI transformation is just about complete. By the spring of 2024, almost two-thirds of Harvard undergrads were drawing on the tool at least once a week. In a British survey of full-time undergraduates from December, 92 percent reported using AI in some fashion. Forty percent agreed that “content created by generative AI would get a good grade in my subject,” and nearly one in five admitted that they’ve tested that idea directly, by using AI to complete their assignments. Such numbers will only rise in the year ahead.

“I cannot think that in this day and age that there is a student who is not using it,” Vasilis Theoharakis, a strategic-marketing professor at the Cranfield School of Management who has done research on AI in the classroom, told me. That’s what I’m seeing in the classes that I teach and hearing from the students at my school: The technology is no longer just a curiosity or a way to cheat; it is a habit, as ubiquitous on campus as eating processed foods or scrolling social media. In the coming fall semester, this new reality will be undeniable. Higher education has been changed forever in the span of a single undergraduate career.

“It can pretty much do everything,” says Harrison Lieber, a WashU senior majoring in economics and computer science (who took a class I taught on AI last term). As a college student, he told me, he has mostly inhabited a world with ChatGPT. For those in his position, the many moral questions that AI provokes—for example, whether it is exploitative, or anti-intellectual, or ecologically unsound—take a back seat to the simple truth of its utility. Lieber characterized the matter as pragmatic above all else: Students don’t want to cheat; they certainly don’t want to erode the value of an education that may be costing them or their family a small fortune. But if you have seven assignments due in five days, and AI could speed up the work by tenfold for the cost of a large pizza, what are you meant to do?

In spring 2023, I spoke with a WashU student whose paper had been flagged by one of the generally unreliable AI detectors that universities have used to stem the tide of cheating. He told me that he’d run his text through grammar-checking software and asked ChatGPT to improve some sentences, and that he’d done this to make time for other activities that he preferred. “Sometimes I want to play basketball,” he said. “Sometimes I want to work out.”

His attitude might have been common among large-language-model users during that first, explosive year of AI college: If a computer helps me with my paper, then I’ll have more time for other stuff. That appeal persists in 2025, but as these tools have taken over in the dorms, the motivations of their users have diversified. For Lieber, AI’s allure seems more about the promise of achievement than efficiency. As with most students who are accepted to and graduate from an elite university, he and his classmates have been striving their whole life. As Lieber put it, if a course won’t have “a tangible impact on my ability to get a good job,” then “it’s not worth putting a lot of my time into.” This approach to education, coupled with a “dismal” outlook for postgraduate employment, justifies an ever more ferocious focus on accomplishment. Lieber is pursuing a minor in film and media studies. He has also started a profitable business while in school. Still, he had to network hard to land a good job after graduation. (He is working in risk management.)

Da’Juantay Wynter, another rising senior at WashU who has never seen a full semester without AI, told me he always writes his own essays but feels okay about using ChatGPT to summarize readings, especially if he is in a rush. And like the other students I spoke with, he’s often in a rush. Wynter is a double major in educational studies and American-culture studies; he has also served as president of the Association of Black Students, and been a member of a student union and various other campus committees. Those roles sometimes feel more urgent than his classwork, he explained. If he does not attend to them, events won’t take place. “I really want to polish up all my skills and intellect during college,” he said. Even as he knows that AI can’t do the work as well, or in a way that will help him learn, “it’s always in the back of my mind: Well, AI can get this done in five seconds.”

Another member of his class, Omar Abdelmoity, serves on the university’s Academic Integrity Board, the body that adjudicates cases of cheating, with AI or otherwise. In almost every case of AI cheating he’s seen, Abdelmoity told me, students really did have the time to write the paper in question—they just got stressed or preoccupied by other things, and turned to AI because it works and it is available. Students also feel the strain of soaring expectations. For those who want to go to medical school, as Abdelmoity does, even getting a 4.0 GPA and solid MCAT scores can seem insufficient for admission to the best programs. Whether or not this is realistic, students have internalized the message that they should be racking up more achievements and experience: putting in clinical hours, publishing research papers, and leading clubs, for example. In response, they seek ways to “time shift,” Abdelmoity said, so they can fit more in. And that’s at an elite private university, he continued, where the pressure is high but so is the privilege. At a state school, a student might be more likely to work multiple jobs and take care of their family. Those ordinary demands may encourage AI use even more.

In the end, Abdelmoity said, academic-integrity boards such as the one he sits on can only do so much. For students who have access to AI, an education is what you make of it.

If the AI takeover of higher ed is nearly complete, plenty of professors are oblivious. It isn’t that they fail to understand the nature of the threat to classroom practice. But my recent interviews with colleagues have led me to believe that, on the whole, faculty simply fail to grasp the immediacy of the problem. Many seem unaware of how utterly normal AI has become for students. For them, the coming year could provide a painful revelation.

Some professors I spoke with have been taking modest steps in self-defense: They’re abandoning online and take-home assignments, hoping to retain the purity of their coursework. Kerri Tobin, an associate professor of education at Louisiana State University, told me that she is making undergrads do a lot more handwritten, in-class writing—a sentiment I heard many times this summer. The in-class exam, and its associated blue book, is also on the rise. And Abdelmoity reported that the grading in his natural-science courses has already been rejiggered, deemphasizing homework and making tests count for more. These adjustments might be helpful, but they also risk alienating students. Being forced to write out essays in longhand could make college feel even more old-fashioned than it did before, and less connected to contemporary life.

Other professors believe that moral appeals may still have teeth. Annabel Rothschild, an assistant professor of computer science at Bard College, said she’s found that blanket rules and prohibitions have been less effective than a personal address and appeal to social responsibility. Rothschild is particularly concerned about the “environmental harms” of AI, and she reports that students have responded to discussions that vein. (AI data centers consume a large amount of water and electricity.) The fact that she’s a scientist who understands the technology gives her message greater credibility. It also helps that she teaches at a small college with a focus on the arts.

Today’s seniors entered college at the tail end of the coronavirus pandemic, a crisis that once seemed likely to produce its own transformation of higher ed. The sudden switch to Zoom classes in 2020 revealed, over time, just how outmoded the standard lecture had become; it also showed that, if forced by circumstance, colleges could turn on a dime. But COVID led to little lasting change in the college classroom. Some of the students I spoke with said the response to AI has been meager too. They wondered why faculty weren’t doing more to adjust teaching practices to match the fundamental changes wrought by new technologies—and potentially improve the learning experience in the process.

Lieber said that he wants to learn to make arguments and communicate complex ideas, as he does in his film minor. But he also wonders why more courses can’t assess those skills through classroom discussion (which is hard to fake) instead of written essays or research papers (which may be completed with AI). “People go to a discussion-based class, and 80 percent of the class doesn’t participate in discussion,” he said.

The truth is that many professors would like to make this change but simply can’t. A lot of us might want to judge students on the merits of their participation in class, but we’ve been discouraged from doing so out of fear that such evaluations will be deemed arbitrary and inequitable—and that students and their parents might complain. When professors take class participation into account, they do so carefully: Students tend to be graded on whether they show up or on the number of times they speak in class, rather than the quality of what they say. Erin McGlothlin, the vice dean of undergraduate affairs in WashU’s College of Arts & Sciences, told me this stems from the belief that grading rubrics should be crystal clear in spelling out how class discussion is evaluated.

For professors, this approach avoids the risk of any conflicts related to accommodating students’ mental health or politics, or to bureaucratic matters. But it also makes the modern classroom more vulnerable to the incursion of AI. If what a student says in person can’t be assessed rigorously, then what they type on their computer—perhaps with automated help—will matter all the more.

Like the other members of his class, Lieber did experience a bit of college life before ChatGPT appeared. Even then, he said, at the very start of his freshman year, he felt alienated from some of his introductory classes. “I would think to myself, What the hell am I doing, sitting watching this professor give the same lecture that he has given every year for the last 30 years?” But he knew the answer even then: He was there to subsidize that professor’s research. At America’s research universities, teaching is a secondary job activity, at times neglected by faculty who want to devote as much time as possible to writing grants, running labs, and publishing academic papers. The classroom experience was suffering even before AI came onto the scene.

Now professors face their own temptations from AI, which can enable them to get more work done, and faster, just as it does for students. I’ve heard from colleagues who admit to using AI-generated recommendation letters and course syllabi. Others clearly use AI to write up their research. And still more are eager to discuss the wholesome-seeming ways they have been putting the technology to use—by simulating interactions with historical authors, for example, or launching minors in applied AI.

But students seem to want a deeper sort of classroom innovation. They’re not looking for gimmicks—such as courses that use AI only to make boring topics seem more current. Students like Lieber, who sees his college education as a means of setting himself up for his career, are demanding something more. Instead of being required to take tests and write in-class essays, they want to do more project-based learning—with assignments that “emulate the real world,” as Lieber put it.

But designing courses of this kind, which resist AI shortcuts, would require professors to undertake new and time-consuming labor themselves. That assignment comes at the worst possible time. Universities have been under systematic attack since President Donald Trump took office in January. Funding for research has been cut, canceled, disrupted, or stymied for months. Labs have laid off workers. Degree programs have cut doctoral admissions. Multi-center research projects have been put on hold. The “college experience” that Americans have pursued for generations may soon be over.

The existence of these stressors puts higher ed at greater risk from AI. Now professors find themselves with even more demands than they anticipated and fewer ways to get them done. The best, and perhaps the only, way out of AI’s college takeover would be to embark on a redesign of classroom practice. But with so many other things to worry about, who has the time? In this way, professors face the same challenge as their students in the year ahead: A college education will be what they make of it too. At some point, everyone on campus will have to do the work.
