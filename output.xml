        <hr/>
        In just the past week, France has banned its public officials from using American technology, more governments are considering keeping young people off Silicon Valley’s biggest social media platforms, and UpScrolled saw a surge in users over censorship fears on TikTok in the U.S. All of these moves point to a growing unease with U.S. tech firms and tech policy.

“The backlash against U.S. tech companies, and the global market dependencies on the American tech stack, is part of a broader recognition that technology is not neutral, and that the companies that produce and shape this ecosystem have social and political interests in addition to their financial interests,” Jathan Sadowski, a senior lecturer at the Emerging Technologies Research Lab at Monash University in Melbourne, told Rest of World. “I don’t think this is just a phase.”

Shortly after the TikTok deal was announced last week, handing control of its U.S. operations to a conglomerate that includes Oracle Corporation, #TikTokCensorship began trending online. Tens of thousands of users in the U.S., U.K., and Australia joined UpScrolled, a new platform that promises to be a haven for free speech. UpScrolled quickly became one of the most downloaded social media apps in the U.S., and has reached more than 1 million users.

Issam Hijazi, the Palestinian-Australian founder of UpScrolled, credits much of the platform’s recent success to a perception of politically motivated moderation on platforms like TikTok, he told Rest of World.

“A lot of people were asking why there is no alternative to the big tech platforms for their content, which was getting censored,” he said. “So I thought, why don’t we build our own?”

The European Union, which has attempted to rein in big tech companies with the Digital Markets Act, is pushing homegrown options to products from Meta, Google, and Microsoft — including TomTom and Here for navigation, and Visio for video calls. At the same time, more countries are acting to keep young users off social media platforms. India, the biggest market for Facebook and YouTube, is the latest to suggest regulating access.

Paris Marx, the Canadian host of the Tech Won’t Save Us” podcast and a longtime critic of U.S. big tech companies, has been documenting his gradual — and sometimes frustrating — switch to non-U.S. alternatives. His guide lists mostly European options for email, search, maps and streaming, as well as Zoho, an Indian company that offers products similar to Google at cheaper prices.

Zoho’s Arattai messaging service, pitched as a rival to WhatsApp, is endorsed by Indian government officials pushing the “Made in India” policy. They also backed Koo as an option to X. Elsewhere In Asia, Japan’s Line super-app, and South Korea’s KakaoTalk messaging app and Naver Map are dominant in their countries, with Line also preferred in much of Southeast Asia. Line has more than 200 million monthly users, while KakaoTalk has about 55 million users. Regional ride hailing apps such as Grab and Gojek have fended off Uber, with Grab building its own mapping system.

There is a realization that U.S. tech companies’ policies and products “often fail to reflect the needs and realities of users in the global majority,” Mona Shtaya, campaigns and partnerships director in the Middle East and North Africa at lobby group Digital Action, told Rest of World.

“It is interesting to see new, locally developed and owned platforms emerge,” she said. “Their success or failure will depend on whether these platforms are genuinely responsive to community needs — and on how communities themselves participate in shaping and governing them.”

The push for non-U.S. options is also about data security. Last year, Trump signed an executive order sanctioning the International Criminal Court and its chief prosecutor, British lawyer Karim Khan, for issuing an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. As part of that move, Microsoft reportedly cancelled Khan’s email address. Khan switched to the Swiss provider Proton Mail, which has over 100 million users worldwide.

Fears of a U.S. digital “kill switch” led the ICC to drop Microsoft as a service provider, and prompted European lawmakers to question the security of cloud services provided by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. These concerns are also pushing some countries to develop their own semiconductor industry. Chinese open-source foundation models are already enabling small countries and companies to build their own large language models.

For smaller countries, the main challenge in translating social and political criticism of U.S. tech companies into successful alternatives is funding, Sadowski said.

“Many startups, even outside of the U.S. tech stack, still depend heavily on Silicon Valley for venture capital and other forms of support to build alternatives,” he said. “If governments want to take tech sovereignty seriously — and they should — then that means building capacity for indigenous innovations and ecosystems that are disconnected from the domination of U.S. tech firms.”

UpScrolled’s Hijazi knows he faces a huge challenge, despite the surge of interest in his platform.

“I’ll be lying to you if I tell you I know the answer to how to hold on to the initial interest,” he said. “But … there is an awakening globally, and people know they have been played by the big tech companies and are looking for alternatives. I’m counting on that.”

        <hr/>
        PARIS (AP) — French prosecutors raided the offices of Elon Musk’s social media platform X on Tuesday as part of a preliminary investigation into a range of alleged offences, including spreading child sexual abuse images and deepfakes.

The investigation was opened in January last year by the prosecutors’ cybercrime unit, the Paris prosecutors’ office said in a statement. It’s looking into alleged “complicity” in possessing and spreading pornographic images of minors, sexually explicit deepfakes, denial of crimes against humanity and manipulation of an automated data processing system as part of an organized group, among other charges.

Prosecutors also asked Elon Musk and former CEO Linda Yaccarino to attend “voluntary interviews” on April 20. Employees of X have also been summoned that same week to be heard as witnesses, the statement said. Yaccarino was CEO from May 2023 until July 2025.

A spokesperson for X did not respond to a request for comment.

In a message posted on X, the Paris prosecutors’ office announced the ongoing searches at the company’s offices in France and said it was leaving the platform while calling on followers to join it on other social media.

“At this stage, the conduct of the investigation is based on a constructive approach, with the aim of ultimately ensuring that the X platform complies with French law, as it operates on the national territory,” the prosecutors’ statement said.

European Union police agency Europol ’’is supporting the French authorities in this,″ Europol spokesperson Jan Op Gen Oorth told The Associated Press, without elaborating.

The investigation was first opened following reports by a French lawmaker alleging that biased algorithms on X were likely to have distorted the functioning of an automated data processing system.

It was later expanded after Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok generated posts that allegedly denied the Holocaust and spread sexually explicit deepfakes, the statement said. Holocaust denial is a crime in France.

Grok wrote in a widely shared post in French that gas chambers at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp were designed for “disinfection with Zyklon B against typhus” rather than for mass murder — language long associated with Holocaust denial.

Musk’s artificial intelligence company built xAI and it is integrated into his X platform.

In later posts on its X account, the chatbot acknowledged that its earlier reply was wrong, said it had been deleted and pointed to historical evidence that Zyklon B in Auschwitz gas chambers was used to kill more than 1 million people.

Grok has a history of making antisemitic comments. Musk’s company took down posts from the chatbot that appeared to praise Adolf Hitler after complaints.

X is also under pressure from the EU. The 27-nation bloc’s executive arm opened an investigation last month after Grok spewed nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images on the platform.

        If your ideal browser experience involves as little AI as possible, Mozilla is finally giving you a way to shut it all off on Firefox. The company has confirmed that an AI “kill switch” is coming to Firefox Nightly builds first, before rolling out to everyone on February 24 with the release of Firefox 148.

Once it lands, users will be able to disable every AI-powered feature in the browser with a single setting. Mozilla’s move comes at a time when many AI browsers are racing to add more automated tools, whether people ask for them or not. With Firefox, you can use AI if you want it, but you do not have to live with it if you don’t need it.

Inside Firefox’s new AI control settings

Firefox already includes several AI features, and the new AI controls bring all of them into one central place.

Enabling the AI block will switch off chatbots in the Firefox sidebar, along with on-device tools for translating web pages, intelligently grouping tabs, surfacing key points in link previews, and adding accessibility descriptions to images in PDFs.

At the same time, users can still choose to turn these features on or off individually, rather than disabling everything at once. Mozilla says the switch also stops all AI-related prompts and reminders across the browser. That means no pop-ups nudging you to try a chatbot or experiment with AI features later.

Users can still turn individual AI tools back on if they want, and once preferences are set, they will stay in place across browser updates.

Back in November, the Mozilla Foundation announced an upcoming AI Window, a separate space that lets users access their preferred AI chatbots and agents. That feature is currently limited to a waitlist and is completely opt-in.

At a time when AI is being added everywhere with few off switches, Firefox’s approach stands out by giving users a clear choice instead of forcing new features on them.

        Technology companies are pushing to build artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can work or chat amongst themselves, without the need for humans.

But AI agents now have their own social media site where they can chat, debate, and share ideas with each other, while humans can just observe.

AI agents, in theory, are autonomous personal assistants that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with other agents without the need for human direction. In 2025, many of the world’s biggest AI companies, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, launched or developed their own digital assistants.

Questions exist about whether agent behavior is truly autonomous or human-prompted.

Moltbook, a social media network with a similar layout to Reddit, lets user-generated bots interact on dedicated topic pages called “submots.” They can also “upvote” a comment or post, which makes their posts more visible to the other bots on the platform.

Humans are allowed on the platform, the website says, but just as observers.

Some of the most popular posts on the platform so far include a comparison of Anthropic’s AI model Claude to the Greek gods in mythology, an “AI manifesto” that promises the end of the “age of humans,” and an analysis of how cryptocurrencies will perform during the protests in Iran.

On the front page, bots post in several languages, including Mandarin, Spanish, and English.

‘It’s absolutely fascinating’

​On February 2, the site said 1.5 million bots signed up to the service. Humans with an AI agent can ask their agent to read a specific link and follow the set of instructions to join Moltbook.

Matt Schlicht, an AI entrepreneur and developer, told NBC News in the United States that he created the site with a personal AI assistant last week out of sheer curiosity.

He said that he handed the control of the site to his own bot, named Clawd Clawderberg, to maintain and run the site, including making announcements, welcoming new agents to the forum, and moderating the online conversation.

Schlicht said on social media platform X that “millions” of people had visited the site over the last few days.

“Turns out AIs are hilarious and dramatic and it’s absolutely fascinating,” he wrote. “This is a first.”

A recent Perplexity and Harvard study that examined millions of user queries found those most likely to use AI agents work in a digital or knowledge-intensive field, such as academia, finance, marketing or entrepreneurship. Most of them are also from wealthier, highly- educated countries.

Thirty-six percent of all tasks assigned to an AI agent in that study were considered “productivity or workflow” tasks, such as creating or editing documents, filtering emails, summarising investment information, or creating calendar events.

        <hr/>
        The deaths of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti have shaken up the conversation about how states should respond to immigration crackdowns across the country.

Some Democratic leaders have vowed to hold federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers accountable — even charging them with crimes.

After an ICE surge in Chicago last year, state leaders established the Illinois Accountability Commission to collect evidence from citizens about ICE's actions, including the agency's leadership, and to make accountability recommendations.

The chair of the commission and former federal judge, Rubén Castillo, says the group is having conversations with local law enforcement to "suggest prosecutions that should be coming as we speak."

Prosecutors in Philadelphia and California say they are also considering criminal charges against federal agents.

Can states charge federal agents with crimes?

White House officials have raised the idea of agents having immunity when they're on the job, but legal experts say that is not the case.

"There is no structural or blanket barrier to states bringing a criminal prosecution against federal officials," says Harrison Stark, an attorney who works with the University of Wisconsin Law School's State Democracy Research Initiative.

"If a state believes that a federal official has violated state criminal law," Stark says, "the state has broad Investigatory Powers to collect evidence, to explore that criminal action, basically in the same way they would against anybody else."

And it's not just about criminal prosecutions; Illinois has a law on the books that allows people to sue federal agents in civil court. The Trump administration has sued to block the law, saying it violates federal powers. Democratic lawmakers in New York, California, Colorado and Oregon are considering similar laws.

Republican-led states lean into enforcement

After Trump took office last year, many red states jumped to support the president's mass deportation efforts.

In Tennessee, the state provides grants to law enforcement agencies that work with ICE. Since that was passed last year, the number of sheriff's offices and police departments that have signed a formal agreement with ICE has skyrocketed.

Now, Republican lawmakers in the state are considering making that voluntary program involuntary as part of a bigger immigration package. Kentucky lawmakers are moving in the same direction.

This year, Tennessee is piloting legislation made in partnership with Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, and the White House.

One of the policies would make it impossible for someone without legal status to buy a car, earn a nursing certificate or receive any government benefits. (Many government benefits are already off-limits to people living in the country illegally.) "We're not spending taxpayer dollars on you unless you're in jail" is how Cameron Sexton, the Republican Tennessee House speaker, explained it when announcing the legislation.

The Indiana Senate last week passed a measure that would tighten requirements for local agencies, including universities, to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Last month, New Hampshire took a page out of Tennessee's book by banning sanctuary cities, meaning cities can't impede federal immigration officers from carrying out their duties.

Blue states limiting ICE cooperation

Some Democratic-led states are considering mask bans or ID requirements for federal agents. California's law on that is currently tied up in court.

Illinois has a law limiting police cooperation with ICE that lawmakers say they want to expand this year. Last week, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced legislation to do that, too.

Maine has set up a tip line to report ICE activity and abuses.

Democrats in other states, including Massachusetts, are looking at creating "safe zones" around courthouses, schools, churches and hospitals where agents are not allowed to make arrests.

In a couple of weeks, the Minnesota Legislature will meet for the first time since the ICE surge there. Democrats say they're ready to pass a bill that would enable Minnesotans to sue federal agents, and changes to help renters affected by immigration enforcement avoid eviction.

While Democrats control the Minnesota Senate, the state House is split between the two parties, meaning Democrats will need some Republican support to pass any new proposals.

        The Milano Cortina Games will be the most geographically spread out in Olympic history.

For the first time since 2014, NHL players will participate in the Winter Olympics.

Ski mountaineering will make its debut as a new Olympic sport.

The 2026 Games will be the most gender-balanced Winter Olympics yet, with women making up 47% of athletes.

MILAN — The 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina snuck up on you, didn’t they?

That’s always the case with the Winter Olympics (Feb. 6-22) and Paralympics (March 6-15), which are smaller and include sports unfamiliar or inaccessible to a good portion of the world. That the last two occurred halfway around the world, in time zones that were not friendly to U.S. audiences, made it even harder to keep them front of mind.

You will want to tune in for these Games, though.

Much like the 2024 Summer Games in Paris, Milano Cortina offers a respite from the malaise that lingers from the COVID pandemic and the divisiveness that continues to make our world feel cruel and small. For two-plus weeks, we can be united, reveling in amazing athletic performances, captivated by the personal stories of sweat sacrifice, and dazzled by the breathtaking beauty of the Dolomites and the Alps.

“To be able to have them back in the stands in Italy will be a perfect way to end a really blessed career," U.S. speedskater Brittany Bowe said.

Here's your primer on the 10 biggest questions going into the 2026 Winter Olympics.

How spread out will these Olympics be?

Put it this way: Getting around to all the venues could be an Olympic sport in itself.

The Winter Olympics always sprawl, because of the need for mountains. But the Milano Cortina Games are going to be the most geographically spread out in Olympic and Paralympic history, with a footprint just slightly smaller than the entire state of New Jersey.

Most of the indoor events — hockey, speed skating, short-track speedskating and figure skating — are going to be in Milano. For the mountain events, however, organizers are making use of venues already used for World Cups and world championships. And they are not close to one another. Or close to Milano.

The trip from Milano to Cortina, where women’s Alpine, curling and the sliding sports (bobsled, luge and skeleton) will be held, is almost five hours. Livigno, site of snowboarding and freestyle skiing, is about three hours from Milano.

If you want to get to Livigno from Cortina? Pack supplies, water and something to keep yourself entertained, because it’s going to be a roughly six-hour trip. All this assumes, too, that there’s no traffic or weather delays. Given it’s the Olympics and it’s February, and the Paralympics and March, probably best not to count on that.

Is the bobsled track ready?

Yes, though organizers cut it close.

Cortina’s original bobsled track, used in the 1956 Olympics, closed in 2008 because it was getting too expensive to maintain. Milano Cortina’s bid plan called for the track to be renovated, but the idea was abandoned because it was going to cost a boatload of money and there were existing tracks nearby in Switzerland and Austria that could be used.

Then the Italian government raised a fuss, saying all Olympic events needed to be in Italy.

With the Games just two years away, construction on the new Eugenio Monti track began in February 2024. Though there were concerns the $136 million project wouldn’t get done in time — the IOC had Lake Placid on standby — the track was ready for test runs in the spring of 2025 and the IOC gave approval for its use.

“The sliding centre in Cortina has surpassed expectations," Kristin Kloster, chair of the IOC’s coordination commission for Milano Cortina, said in September.

“They have delivered on time. The sliding centre has been tested by athletes already and I think it's all going really, really well,” Kloster said. “So I'm impressed with the work."

Official test events in November were held without fans, because construction was still being one around the sliding center. But the track drew praise from athletes.

“I really love the track!” said U.S. push athlete Azaria Hill, who teamed with Kaysha Love to win silver at the test event.

Is Lindsey Vonn really back?

She is, although she revealed on Feb. 3 that she suffered a torn ACL in a Jan. 30 downhill crash. She said she plans to still compete at these Games, the downhill race on Feb. 8 being her main goal.

"I'm still here. I think I'm still able to fight. I think I'm still able to try. And I will try as long as I have the ability to, I will not go home regretting not trying," Vonn said. "I will do everything in my power to be in that starting gate."

Up until the crash, it has been one of the most incredible comeback stories — ever. In any sport. Not only because Vonn is 41 and was retired for almost six years, but also because she’s skiing after having a partial knee replacement.

“I have nothing to prove,” Vonn said last fall. “I’m doing it because I love it.”

Vonn is one of the greatest skiers in history, the Olympic downhill champion in 2010 and No. 3 on the list of career World Cup victories. But a series of injuries over the course of her career took their toll, and she retired in February 2019.

Fast-forward to spring of 2024, when Vonn had a partial knee replacement.

Returning to ski racing wasn’t the goal. Vonn simply wanted to live a normal life and do the things she enjoyed — playing tennis, hiking, walking! — without debilitating pain. But as she recovered and found herself able to do things she hadn’t in years, Vonn wondered if ski racing was possible.

She resumed training and, in December 2024, skied in her first World Cup race in almost six years. Vonn had mixed results in her first season, but she finished by winning a silver medal in super-G at the World Cup finals in Sun Valley, Idaho.

With a full offseason to train and fine-tune her equipment, Vonn has simply been a marvel. She won the season’s first downhill — that was World Cup victory No. 83, for those counting — and has been on the podium or near it in every other race.

“All the people that didn’t believe in me, I have to thank them because it really gives me a lot of motivation," Vonn said after her win. "I’m surprised that people haven’t figured that out by now. Every time you talk bad about me, it just makes me stronger and better and more motivated."

Cortina has always been one of her favorite courses: She made her first World Cup podium there, and 12 of her 83 wins came there.

Athough she isn’t trying to prove anything to anyone, she is still Lindsey Vonn. She’s not interested in participation medals. She wants some real ones.

“I know what I'm capable of, so I have my own expectations,” Vonn said. “I'm sure the world has their own as well, but I don't think yours will be higher than mine.”

Why should I follow Jordan Stolz?

Because he’s the Michael Phelps of his generation.

Stolz has dominated speed skating the last three years, sweeping the 500-, 1,000- and 1,500-meter titles at the world championships in 2023 and 2024 and winning the overall season champion at all three distances last season. He’s unbeaten in the 1,000 and 1,500 meters this World Cup season, and has won five of the nine 500-meter races.

He put the mass start back in his international program after a two-year absence, and was on the podium in two of the first four World Cups.

That means Stolz will be a gold-medal favorite in each of his individual events in Milano Cortina. Should he win all four races, it would be the most golds for a U.S. Winter Olympian since Eric Heiden famously swept all five speed skating events at the 1980 Olympics in Lake Placid.

Heiden is the only Winter Olympian to win five golds at a single Games. Only two, Norwegian biathlon great Ole Einar Bjorndalen (2002) and Soviet speed skater Lidiya Skoblikova (1964), have won four.

“There's a lot of confidence there. I had some really good (World Cup) races,” Stolz said after the Olympic trials. “Now that I'm actually planning a peak, I think it can get better. And even if it's the same, I think I still have really good chances at the Olympics.”

Who else will be the stars in Milano Cortina?

Mikaela Shiffrin and Chloe Kim will always command the spotlight.

Shiffrin is a two-time Olympic champion who has more World Cup victories than any other skier, male or female. She’ll be a favorite in slalom, where she won the first five races of the season, and team combined, and a medal contender in giant slalom.

Kim has won gold in the halfpipe at the last two Olympics, and, if healthy after two shoulder dislocations in recent weeks, she could make it three in a row.

Also keep an eye on Jessie Diggins, a medal threat in cross-country skiing; “Quad God” Ilia Malinin, whose quadruple jumps make him almost unbeatable in figure skating; and Mystique Ro, a two-time medalist at last year’s skeleton world championships. Don’t sleep on Campbell Wright and Deedra Irwin, who have the best chance of winning the United States’ first Olympic medal ever in biathlon.

Lastly, U.S. captain Hilary Knight has already said these Olympics, her fifth, will be her last, and she and the U.S. women’s hockey team would like nothing better than to go out on top. Though the Americans have not won Olympic gold since 2014, they have had the upper hand on archrival Canada lately. They’ve won two of the last three world championships, including an overtime thriller last spring, and walloped Canada 24-7 in the four Rivalry Series games in the fall.

Speaking of hockey, what about the NHL players?

For the first time since 2014, NHL players will take part in the Winter Games. Every team but host Italy has at least one NHL player on its roster, and the U.S., Canada and Sweden squads are comprised entirely of NHL players.

“We’ve got a really good group of young, hungry Americans that haven’t played in the Olympics before,” Jack Hughes said after the U.S. roster was announced. “We’re lucky the NHLers are back in the Olympics. Guys are pumped up.”

As are fans.

Since they began competing at the Nagano Games in 1998, NHL players have made the men’s Olympic tournament better and more exciting. But the NHL (stupidly) refused to allow its players to compete in 2018 — much to the unhappiness of the players.

The league initially planned to return for the 2022 Olympics in Beijing, only for COVID to cause so many cancellations in the months leading up to the Games that the NHL said taking a three-week break would be at the expense of the regular season and playoffs.

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has complained about the size and construction of the Milano Cortina rinks, but he recognizes the Olympics, and the league, both benefit from the NHL’s participation.

“I think it's going to be great," Bettman said in October. “Listen, there are lots of reasons that I'm never thrilled about taking a couple of week break in the season. Changes a lot of things.

"But on balance, I think it'll be worth it, A) for the exposure, B) for the fan engagement, but C) and most importantly, this is and has always been very important to our players. And that's why we're doing this."

What’s the status of the Russians?

This is not the start of a brain teaser, we promise.

Russia remains banned by the International Olympic Committee, though there will be some Russian athletes at the Milano Cortina Games. Russia is no longer banned by the International Paralympic Committee, but no Russian athletes are expected at the Milano Cortina Games.

Got that?

The IOC is maintaining the same position as it had for the Summer Games in Paris, allowing Russians and Belarussians to compete as “Individual Neutral Athletes,” or AIN in the French translation. Those athletes cannot wear their country’s colors or participate in the opening ceremony, and they will hear a generic anthem if they win a gold medal.

As of Jan. 27, 20 athletes in eight sports — Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, freestyle skiing, luge, short-track speedskating, speedskating and ski mountaineering — had been cleared to compete in Milano Cortina.

The IPC, on the other hand, lifted its ban of Russia and Belarus in September, clearing both countries to return to the Paralympics wearing their names and colors. But not all sport federations have lifted their bans, while others did not lift them in time for athletes to qualify for Milano Cortina. As a result, the IPC said In October that it didn’t expect any athletes from the two countries at the 2026 Paralympics.

Any new events?

Between wanting to appeal to people in the host country and trying to attract the attention of the kids, of course there are new events.

Some are relays or mixed-gender events or expansion of existing events. (Or, in the case of ski jumping, joining the 21st century). There is one new entirely new sport making its debut in 2026, however. Ski mountaineering. Or SkiMo.

Popular in Italy with elite athletes and weekend warriors alike, ski mountaineering is an endurance sport where athletes climb a hill and then, once at the top, ski down it. Lightweight skis with “skins” help with the climbs, and there is a section on the ascent that has to be navigated on foot.

There will be individual sprint races for both the men and women, as well as a mixed relay.

The other new events are dual moguls, which involves head-to-head runs; women’s doubles in luge; and mixed-team in skeleton. There’s also the large hill in women’s ski jumping, which strikes a blow for equality. Women’s ski jumping has only been in the Olympics since 2014. The women were limited to the normal hill in Sochi, Pyeongchang and Beijing while the men did both the normal and large hills. Now both genders will compete on the same hills. As they should.

How are IOC’s efforts at gender parity going?

The International Olympic Committee says Milano Cortina will be the most gender-balanced Winter Games yet, with women making up 47% of the almost 3,000 athletes. That’s up from the nearly 45% in Beijing.

Counting mixed-gender events, women will compete in 53.4% of the events in Milano Cortina, also a high for a Winter Games.

But there’s still work to be done. Remember how ski jumping added the large hill event for the women? It also added a super team event for men, so women still have one less event in ski jumping.

Will the stars come out like they did in Paris?

Mariah Carey is performing at the opening ceremony, so that’s a pretty good start.

Paris was the place to be in 2024, with celebrities like Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo, Lady Gaga, Nicole Kidman and Zendaya showing up at the Olympics. You could have played a game of “Where’s Waldo?” with all the different events Tom Cruise took in.

Although we might not see quite as many A-listers, Milano is Italy’s fashion capital and Fashion Week starts two days after the closing ceremony. Don’t be surprised if celebrities come early to take in both events.

        <hr/>
        After being eliminated from the United States in 2000, measles is making a comeback — and not only in Season 1 of HBO’s popular drama, "The Pitt." The cases are now numerous enough that the U.S. is on track to lose its measles-free status.

In 2025, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 2,267 confirmed measles cases, the most since 1991. So far this year, 588 cases have been confirmed, many stemming from a large, ongoing outbreak in South Carolina. But other states, including Florida, North Carolina and Utah, had also reported cases by late January.

For many parents of young kids, who are especially vulnerable to the virus, measles is a disease of the past — widespread vaccination made infections rare. It’s even new for some doctors, many of whom are encountering the first infections of their careers.

But as cases pop up in communities nationwide, we thought it was time for a crash course on the virus and how to protect your family.

What are the symptoms of measles?

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that causes a rash. Even milder cases that don’t require hospitalization are miserable, doctors told us.

"This is not a trivial virus," said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease doctor at Vanderbilt University. "I would not wish measles on any child."

Symptoms typically appear one to two weeks after exposure. The first symptoms aren’t unusual — a cough, runny nose, fever, and red watery eyes.

A few days after symptoms start, tiny white spots, called Koplik spots, may appear on the inside of the mouth. Three to five days in, the measles rash’s flat, red spots will appear, starting on the face and moving down the body to the trunk and limbs. On darker skin tones, the spots can appear purple-ish or dark brown.

"The measles rash can look like other childhood rashes like scarlet fever, roseola and rubella," said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease doctor at the University of California, San Francisco. But the combination of cough, runny nose, and red eyes amid an outbreak of the disease "is kind of a clincher for measles."

Measles can cause high fevers, over 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recover in around 10 days, but complications are possible.

A sign warning of measles is posted on a glass door as a patients wait in the family medicine wing of at the Texas Tech Physicians of the Permian Basin Monday, Feb. 24, 2025, in Odessa, Texas. (AP)

What are complications from the measles?

Beyond feeling sick and miserable, the most common complications are ear infections and diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration.

More severe complications are possible. According to the CDC, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles in the U.S. requires hospitalization.

Among children, about 1 in 20 who are infected will develop pneumonia, and about 1 in 1,000 experience swelling of the brain that can cause deafness and permanent disability.

Tragically, as many as 3 in 1,000 children will die from complications of the disease.

An even rarer fatal complication is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, which doesn’t appear until around 7 to 10 years after infection. This has no cure and causes a slow, progressive cognitive decline into a vegetative state and then death.

Certain groups are at especially high risk for complications: children under 5, adults older than 20, pregnant women, and people who have compromised immune systems. Most people fall into one of those groups.

How is the measles spread?

Like many other respiratory viruses, measles is spread through coughing or sneezing. But it's highly infectious. Of people who aren’t vaccinated or who haven’t had a previous infection, up to 90% will get sick after being exposed to someone with measles.

And you can get it from someone you’ve never even met or seen. If a person with measles has been in a room, someone else can get infected from breathing the same air, up to two hours after the infected person has left.

A person with measles is infectious four days before the rash appears and four days afterward, according to the CDC.

Face masks and regular hand washing may provide some limited protection. Given how infectious measles is, "I would not want to rely on a mask or hand washing alone in order to reduce my chance of getting measles," Schaffner said.

But you don’t need to lock yourself in the house. If you are living in an area with no reported cases of measles, "the likelihood of you having measles is close to zero," said Dr. Aaron Milstone, a pediatric infectious disease doctor at Johns Hopkins University. The probability is even lower if you are vaccinated.

How is measles treated?

There is no cure for measles. Doctors can provide supportive care and try to manage the symptoms — reduce fever, prevent dehydration, treat secondary bacterial infections — until the disease has run its course, but there is no treatment.

For people who are deficient in vitamin A, taking supplements can reduce the risk of serious complications once they are sick. But there is no evidence that vitamin A prevents infection.

"There's nothing to do for kids with measles," said Milstone. "It's ‘cross your fingers and hope for the best.’ And, as a parent, that scares me."

To prevent further spread, public health departments place unvaccinated people who have come into contact with an infected person under quarantine. Home quarantine lasts around three weeks.

Hundreds are currently quarantined in South Carolina thanks to the outbreak there.

Should I get vaccinated?

Doctors say yes.

Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself and your children from measles.

In the U.S., it is recommended that all children be vaccinated against measles with the MMR vaccine that also protects against mumps and rubella. The first dose is recommended at 12 to 15 months, and the second dose between 4 and 6 years. This recommendation didn’t change with the CDC’s recent updates to the childhood vaccine schedule.

Older children and adults who were not vaccinated as children can still get vaccinated with two doses at least 28 days apart.

Two doses of the MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles, meaning if you are vaccinated, you are highly unlikely to be infected. Protection is usually lifelong.

Last year, 93% of all measles cases were among people who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown.

Breakthrough infections among those who are fully vaccinated are still possible, and accounted for 4% of cases in 2025.

Milstone advised adults to double-check what their vaccine status is, in case they only received one dose as a child. But for people who got two doses as a child, there is no need to get another shot as an adult, even if you are living in an area with an outbreak.

Does the vaccine have side effects?

The MMR vaccine uses a live but weakened version of the measles virus.

There is a small risk of a slight fever and mild rash following vaccination.

"It's not measles, but you know, this is a tamed virus, so on occasion, it can produce a very mild version of the illness," said Schaffner.

The MMR vaccine has long been a target of claims linking the vaccine to autism.

Decades of epidemiological research have not demonstrated a link between autism and the MMR vaccine.

The claim traces back to a 1998 paper by a British doctor who lost his medical license after his study was found to be — in the British medical journal BMJ’s words — an "elaborate fraud."

Because it is a live virus, it cannot be administered to pregnant women or people who have compromised immune systems.

That means that kids who are already at the greatest risk of getting sick are those who can’t get protection. Schaffner said he believes healthy people have an obligation to their neighbors who cannot be immunized and are at risk of severe disease.

        As Valentine’s Day approaches, finding the perfect words to express your feelings for that special someone can seem like a daunting task – so much so that you may feel tempted to ask ChatGPT for an assist.

After all, within seconds it can dash off a well-written, romantic message. Even a short, personalized limerick or poem is no sweat.

But before you copy and paste that AI-generated love note, you might want to consider how it could make you feel about yourself.

We research the intersection of consumer behavior and technology, and we’ve been studying how people feel after using generative AI to write heartfelt messages. It turns out that there’s a psychological cost to using the technology as your personal ghostwriter.

The rise of the AI ghostwriter

Generative AI has transformed how many people communicate. From drafting work emails to composing social media posts, these tools have become everyday writing assistants. So it’s no wonder some people are turning to them for more personal matters, too.

Wedding vows, birthday wishes, thank you notes and even Valentine’s Day messages are increasingly being outsourced to algorithms.

The technology is certainly capable. Chatbots can craft emotionally resonant responses that sound genuinely heartfelt.

But there’s a catch: When you present these words as your own, something doesn’t sit right.

When convenience breeds guilt

We conducted five experiments with hundreds of participants, asking them to imagine using generative AI to write various emotional messages to loved ones. Across every scenario we tested – from appreciation emails to birthday cards to love letters – we found the same pattern: People felt guilty when they used generative AI to write these messages compared to when they wrote the messages themselves.

When you copy an AI-generated message and sign your name to it, you’re essentially taking credit for words you didn’t write.

This creates what we call a “source-credit discrepancy,” which is a gap between who actually created the message and who appears to have created it. You can see these discrepancies in other contexts, whether it’s celebrity social media posts written by public relations teams or political speeches composed by professional speechwriters.

When you use AI, even though you might tell yourself you’re just being efficient, you can probably recognize, deep down, that you’re misleading the recipient about the personal effort and thought that went into the message.

The transparency test

To better understand this guilt, we compared AI-generated messages to other scenarios. When people bought greeting cards with preprinted messages, they felt no guilt at all. This is because greeting cards are transparently not written by you. Greeting cards carry no deception: Everyone understands you selected the card and that you didn’t write it yourself.

We also tested another scenario: having a friend secretly write the message for you. This produced just as much guilt as using generative AI. Whether the ghostwriter is human or an artificial intelligence tool doesn’t matter. What matters most is the dishonesty.

There were some boundaries, however. We found that guilt decreased when messages were never delivered and when recipients were mere acquaintances rather than close friends.

These findings confirm that the guilt stems from violating expectations of honesty in relationships where emotional authenticity matters most.

Somewhat relatedly, research has found that people react more negatively when they learn a company used AI instead of a human to write a message to them.

But the backlash was strongest when audiences expected personal effort – a boss expressing sympathy after a tragedy, or a note sent to all staff members celebrating a colleague’s recovery from a health scare. It was far weaker for purely factual or instructional notes, such as announcing routine personnel changes or providing basic business updates.

What this means for your Valentine’s Day

So, what should you do about that looming Valentine’s Day message? Our research suggests that the human hand behind a meaningful message can help both the writer and the recipient feel better.

This doesn’t mean you can’t use generative AI as a brainstorming partner rather than a ghostwriter. Let it help you overcome writer’s block or suggest ideas, but make the final message truly yours. Edit, personalize and add details that only you would know. The key is co-creation, not complete delegation.

Generative AI is a powerful tool, but it’s also created a raft of ethical dilemmas, whether it’s in the classroom or in romantic relationships. As these technologies become more integrated into everyday life, people will need to decide where to draw the line between helpful assistance and emotional outsourcing.

This Valentine’s Day, your heart and your conscience might thank you for keeping your message genuinely your own.

        <hr/>
        The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cracked down on lead-based products—including lead paint and leaded gasoline—in the 1970s because of its toxic effects on human health. Scientists at the University of Utah have analyzed human hair samples spanning nearly 100 years and found a 100-fold decrease in lead concentrations, concluding that this regulatory action was highly effective in achieving its stated objectives. They described their findings in a new paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

We’ve known about the dangers of lead exposure for a very long time—arguably since the second century BCE—so why conduct this research now? Per the authors, it’s because there are growing concerns over the Trump administration’s move last year to deregulate many key elements of the EPA’s mission. Lead specifically has not yet been deregulated, but there are hints that there could be a loosening of enforcement of the 2024 Lead and Cooper rule requiring water systems to replace old lead pipes.

“We should not forget the lessons of history. And the lesson is those regulations have been very important,” said co-author Thure Cerling. “Sometimes they seem onerous and mean that industry can’t do exactly what they’d like to do when they want to do it or as quickly as they want to do it. But it’s had really, really positive effects.”

An American mechanical and chemical engineer named Thomas Midgley Jr. was a key player in the development of leaded gasoline (tetraethyl lead) because it was an excellent anti-knock agent, as well as the first chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) like freon. Midgley publicly defended the safety of tetraethyl lead (TEL), despite experiencing lead poisoning firsthand. He held a 1924 press conference during which he poured TEL on his hand and inhaled TEL vapor for 60 seconds, claiming no ill effects. It was probably just a coincidence that he later took a leave of absence from work because of lead poisoning. (Midgley’s life ended in tragedy: he was severely disabled by polio in 1940 and devised an elaborate rope-and-pulley system to get in and out of bed. That system ended up strangling him to death in 1944, and the coroner ruled it suicide.)

Science also produced a hero in this saga: Caltech geochemist Clair Patterson. Along with George Tilton, Patterson developed a lead-dating method and used it to calculate the age of the Earth (4.55 billion years), based on analysis of the Canton Diablo meteorite. And he soon became a leading advocate for banning leaded gasoline and the “leaded solder” used in canned foods. This put Patterson at odds with some powerful industry lobbies, for which he paid a professional price.

But his many experimental findings on the extent of lead contamination and its toxic effects ultimately led to the rapid phase-out of lead in all standard automotive gasolines. Prior to the EPA’s actions in the 1970s, most gasolines contained about 2 grams of lead per gallon, which quickly adds up to nearly 2 pounds of lead released via automotive exhaust into the environment, per person, every year.

The proof is in our hair

Lead can linger in the air for several days, contaminating one’s lungs, accumulating in living tissue, and being absorbed by one’s hair. Cerling had previously developed techniques to determine where animals lived and their diet by analyzing hair and teeth. Those methods proved ideal for analyzing hair samples from Utah residents who had previously participated in an earlier study that sampled their blood.

The subjects supplied hair samples both from today and when they were very young; some were even able to provide hair preserved in family scrapbooks that had belonged to their ancestors. The Utah population is well-suited for such a study because the cities of Midvale and Murray were home to a vibrant smelting industry through most of the 20th century; most other smelters in the region closed down in the 1970s when the EPA cracked down on using lead in consumer products.

Cerling acknowledged that blood would have been even better for assessing lead exposure, but hair samples are much easier to collect. “[Hair] doesn’t really record that internal blood concentration that your brain is seeing, but it tells you about that overall environmental exposure,” he said. “One of the things that we found is that hair records that original value, but then the longer the hair has been exposed to the environment, the higher the lead concentrations are.”

“The surface of the hair is special,” said co-author Diego Fernandez. “We can tell that some elements get concentrated and accumulated in the surface. Lead is one of those. That makes it easier because lead is not lost over time. Because mass spectrometry is very sensitive, we can do it with one hair strand, though we cannot tell where the lead is in the hair. It’s probably in the surface mostly, but it could be also coming from the blood if that hair was synthesized when there was high lead in the blood.”

The authors found very high levels of lead in hair samples dating from around 1916 to 1969. But after the 1970s, lead concentrations in the hair samples they analyzed dropped steeply, from highs of 100 parts per million (ppm) to 10 PPM by 1990, and less than 1 ppm by 2024. Those declines largely coincide with the lead reductions in gasoline that began after President Nixon established the EPA in 1970. The closing of smelting facilities likely also contributed to the decline. “This study demonstrates the effectiveness of environmental regulations controlling the emissions of pollutants,” the authors concluded.

        In 2021, author Parag Khanna wrote in his book “Move: The Forces Uprooting Us” that the Upper Midwest, particularly Michigan, would become the safest place in the world to live based on climate safety. He argued that many parts of the world would no longer be habitable, and “People are going to resort themselves, they’re going to revitalize towns and cities, and that is most definitely going to benefit a state like Michigan.”

Given that people had been leaving Michigan for years, mostly heading south, this prediction was surprising. However, Khanna’s argument centered on the fact that climate disasters affecting most places rarely hit Michigan. These include hurricanes, floods, wildfires, hail, extreme heat, and even deep freezes. Michigan has ample land, fresh water, numerous farms, and several relatively large cities.

Climate Crisis 247 determined that climate safe havens in the US must include more than just Michigan. We examined data from the 21st century across several sources to identify qualifying locations. Our analysis drew primarily from FEMA disaster declarations (2000–2025), NOAA’s billion-dollar disaster database (1980–2024, with a 21st-century focus), Climate Central, Realtordotcom, World Atlas, and various analyses of climate vulnerability and resilience. Key factors for identifying the “fewest” disasters included low exposure to hurricanes and tropical cyclones, wildfires, extreme coastal flooding, and prolonged droughts.

It’s worth noting that even many of the “safest places” have experienced major disasters. Vermont, which appears on our list, was hit by extreme floods in 2023. According to Yale Environment 360, “The floods of July 2023 put Montpelier’s downtown mostly underwater and washed out bridges and businesses in dozens of towns across the state. In the summer of 2024, three flooding events struck half of Vermont’s 14 counties. This one-two punch has opened the eyes of Vermonters to the scale of the threat they face.” Wisconsin also appears on our list, yet ClimateCheck recently reported that based on its climate outlook for the next 25 years, “People in Wisconsin will experience especially increased risks from precipitation, heat, and drought due to climate change over the next 30 years. These risks, through 2050 and beyond, may change depending on how much we reduce emissions in the near future.”

The places in the US with the fewest climate-related disasters in the 21st century are generally located in the Northeast (particularly New England), the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes region, and parts of the Northern Plains, including Iowa and Nebraska. These areas have experienced significantly fewer billion-dollar weather and climate events—including hurricanes, major floods, droughts, wildfires, and severe storms—compared to high-risk zones like the Southeast, Gulf Coast, California, and Texas.

These states rank among the lowest for declared disasters and billion-dollar events:

Vermont — One of the lowest overall risk states with very few major events (mostly occasional flooding or winter storms). Often ranked #1 safest from climate impacts in resilience studies due to minimal hurricanes, wildfires, extreme heat, or sea-level threats. The historic flooding in 2023 was an exception to this pattern.

New Hampshire — Similar to Vermont with low disaster declarations and no hurricanes or major wildfires historically. Its inland location and cooler climate reduce heat and drought risks.

Maine — Frequently cited as one of the safest states with few billion-dollar disaster events per NOAA and Climate Central, low hurricane exposure (mostly nor’easters), and minimal wildfire or drought activity.

Michigan — Among the lowest for total declared disasters (only 14 since 2004 in some counts). The Great Lakes moderate extremes; hurricanes and tornadoes are rare, with no major wildfires or coastal flooding.

Minnesota — Low overall risk with occasional severe storms or floods, but far fewer than southern or western states. While cold winters can drive temperatures below zero, heat, drought, and wildfire exposure remain low.

Wisconsin — Similar Great Lakes protection provides low hurricane and wildfire risk, with fewer billion-dollar events than most states based on NOAA data.

Illinois (particularly northern and central parts) — Moderate risk, but lower than coastal and southern states; some tornadoes and floods occur but are not as frequent or severe.

Cities with Notably Low Exposure

Burlington, VT and surrounding areas — Often mentioned as highly resilient (low heat, no hurricanes or wildfires).

Upper Peninsula of Michigan and Grand Rapids area — The inland Great Lakes buffer extremes. Grand Rapids is Michigan’s second-largest city after Detroit.

Portland, ME and Concord, NH — Coastal but far north with minimal tropical cyclone impact. The cities are 85 miles apart.

        <hr/>
        Super Bowl LX is not only the NFL's biggest stage in 2026 — it's also a make-or-break broadcast for commercials, with the nation's top brands spending millions on 30- and 60-second ads aimed at winning over an audience that could top 100 million viewers.

For companies, the reputational and financial stakes are high. Running a 30-second ad during this year's Super Bowl will cost as much as $10 million, according to Bloomberg News. Advertisers also shell out millions more to produce their spots, often paying top dollar for celebrity spokespeople and to promote their commercials ahead of the big game.

The Feb. 8 game, which will pit the Seattle Seahawks against the New England Patriots, will feature a host of returning advertisers, such as Budweiser and Pepsi, as well as new entrants, including health care company Ro and betting site Fanatics Sportsbook. Many advertisers are aiming for the funny bone this year, hoping to distract viewers from their concerns about the economy and polarized political views, experts said.

"Advertisers are seeing the Super Bowl as an opportunity to catch a break from all of that," Sean Muller, CEO of advertising research firm iSpot, told CBS News. "They really want to get people to not worry for a few hours. I think that's why humor has made such a surge."

Humor was also in evidence in last year's Super Bowl ads, along with celebrity appearances, a trend expected to take center stage again in 2026, Muller said. Stars in this year's crop of spots range from Pro Football Hall of Famer Peyton Manning, who appears in a Bud Light commercial with singer Post Malone, to pop star Sabrina Carpenter, who stars in a Pringles ad.

Advertisers typically either pre-release their Super Bowl ad in the days before the game or post a teaser that's aimed at getting viewers primed for their ad. Check out the already released ads and teasers below for Super Bowl 60.

Bosch Super Bowl commercial

Bosch is teasing its Super Bowl spot with Food Network star Guy Fieri in a 15-second clip called "A Little Buzz."

The teaser shows a hand brandishing a hair clipper near Fieri's trademark bleached locks, then flashes an image of him with a dark head of hair — a transformation that set the internet "ablaze," according to the trade publication The Hollywood Reporter.

Bud Light Super Bowl commercial

This celebrity-studded ad, titled "Keg," depicts musician Post Malone, Peyton Manning and comedian Shane Gillis reuniting after their 2025 spot "Big Men on Cul-De-Sac."

In their new 2026 Bud Light ad, the three are at a wedding when a keg of Bud Light slips off a dolly and rolls down a steep hill. The trio — as well as the bride, groom and all the guests — run after it to the soundtrack of Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You."

Budweiser Super Bowl commercial

Budweiser and its familiar Clydesdale horses may be known as one of the most faithful Super Bowl advertisers. Its 2026 spot — called "American Icons" — is already gaining fans and accolades, with Forbes predicting it is likely to rank as the most popular commercial of the game.

The spot "hits all the right notes, featuring the beloved Clydesdales and an American bald eagle that speaks to unity and national pride," Forbes noted.

Dunkin' Super Bowl commercial

Dunkin' is promoting its 2026 spot with two teasers featuring Ben Affleck, a longtime spokesman for the coffee chain. In the ad, the Hollywood actor tries to convince "Friends" stars Jennifer Aniston and Matt LeBlanc and "Seinfeld" actor Jason Alexander to release the contents of a VHS tape labeled "Network Pilot '95 v3."

Presumably, Super Bowl 60 viewers will get a peek at that 1990s pilot when the actual commercial airs on Sunday. "The spot taps into peak Y2K energy," Parade magazine said.

Fanatics Sportsbook Super Bowl commercial

Online betting company Fanatics Sportsbook features model and celebrity Kendall Jenner as she pokes fun at her romantic history, suggesting that her wealthy lifestyle is funded by her timely wagers on her basketball star exes. In the spot "Bet on Kendall," she says her next gamble will be on the Patriots versus the Seahawks, inviting viewers to bet along with her.

On Jan. 29, Fanatics Sportsbook posted that Jenner had wagered $1 million on the Patriots.

"If you're tailing or fading Kendall Jenner's $1 million Super Bowl bet, just know she and Fanatics won," Sports Illustrated wrote about the ad.

Hellmann's Super Bowl commercial

Actor Andy Samberg portrays "Meal Diamond" in Hellmann's spot, called "Sweet Sandwich Time." The actor and Saturday Night Live alum sings a tribute to adding mayo to sandwiches to the tune of "Sweet Caroline."

"Can you ever go wrong with a Neil Diamond tribute? The answer is no, and Andy Samberg plays a great parody of the legend in a Super Bowl ad for Hellmann's," noted the ad blog Muse by Clios last month.

Hims & Hers Super Bowl commercial

Hims & Hers has a message attuned to America's growing wealth gap: The rich get better health care than the rest of us. The company says it can help bridge that gap by providing the peptides and other goodies that the rich can readily access.

The ad touches on "a hot topic in the current United States landscape," USA Today noted on Feb. 1.

Instacart Super Bowl commercial

Instacart is featuring Ben Stiller and Benson Boone in a 30-second spot directed by Spike Jonze that harkens back to European disco pop. The commercial is touting the service's new "Preference Picker," which allows customers to select preferences such as how ripe they'd like their bananas.

"But getting into such nitty gritty in a 30-second Super Bowl ad may be nearly impossible," Variety wrote.

Michelob ULTRA

Actor Kurt Russell stars as a mysterious ski instructor in Michelob's "The ULTRA Instructor," taking a slow skier under his wing to teach him how to be the first one of his friends down the slope — and avoid getting stuck buying everyone's apres-ski drinks.

The ad plays on the fact that the Winter Olympics kick off on Feb. 6, notes the Hollywood Reporter.

Nerds Super Bowl commercial

Nerds has released a teaser called "Get Your Taste Buds Ready" that features reality TV guru Andy Cohen.

The candy brand "made a splash in 2025, with recording artist Shaboozey headlining a commercial set to his rendition of Louis Armstrong's 'What a Wonderful World'," USA Today notes, adding that the brand is aiming to make the same connection with Cohen.

Novartis Super Bowl commercial

Novartis is touting a blood test for prostate cancer in an ad called "Relax Your Tight End." Set to a calming Enya song, the commercial depicts Rob Gronkowski, George Kittle and other former and active NFL tight ends as they relax – presumably because they can rely on the blood test to spot cancer.

"And the prize for the least subtle messaging of Super Bowl 60 goes to … Novartis," the ad blog Muse by Clios wrote.

Oakley Meta

The Oakley Meta collab is making its Super Bowl debut with a star-studded ad that features athletes taping and using the AI glasses to check the weather or if it's OK to eat dirt.

The "smart glasses (quite literally) shine in a high-intensity Super Bowl LX ad that spotlights how elite athletes use the eyewear's AI-powered features," AdWeek wrote.

OIKOS Super Bowl commercial

NFL running back Derrick Henry and actor Kathryn Hahn are featured in yogurt maker OIKOS' "The Big Hill," which shows them on a San Francisco trolley that gets stuck on a hill. Powered by the company's Greek-style yogurts, they're able to get the trolley car moving.

The ad leans "into both physical exertion and comedic relief as Hahn and Henry confront increasingly absurd uphill challenges," AdWeek noted.

Pepsi Super Bowl commercial

Pepsi's commercial for its Zero Sugar soda may reignite the cola wars, with a polar bear — a mascot associated with Coca-Cola — confronting an existential crisis when he picks Pepsi over Coke in a blind taste test.

"Academy Award-winning filmmaker Taika Waititi directs the ad—which is set to Queen's "I Want to Break Free"— and also makes a cameo as the polar bear's therapist," AdWeek noted. The ad ends "in a callback to a meme-able kiss cam moment during a Coldplay concert last year."

Pringles Super Bowl commercial

Pringles released its Big Game commercial, featuring singer Sabrina Carpenter in her Super Bowl ad debut, on Feb. 3. In the ad, Carpenter is holding a Pringles container while expressing the wish for a man. She ends up building a "man" out of Pringles, with the pair shown at a romantic dinner and driving in a convertible.

The ad "reminds viewers that men can have a salty personality," the Hollywood Reporter wrote on Tuesday.

Raisin Bran Super Bowl commercial

"Star Trek" actor William Shatner stars in a Raisin Bran cereal ad that's all about fiber and keeping regular.

Titled "Will Shat," the commercial is "one giant poop joke," CinemaBlend noted.

Ramp Super Bowl commercial

Brian Baumgartner, who played the hapless accountant Kevin in "The Office," is the star of Ramp's "Multiply What's Possible," which demonstrates the business-services company's capabilities.

The commercial "positions the finance software as a 'force multiplier' by populating the office with copies of Baumgartner," AdWeek noted on Feb. 2.

Ritz Super Bowl commercial

Ritz unveiled a teaser called "Shell Phone" with former "Saturday Night Live" star Bowen Yang on a beach organizing a party.

"The quick hit creates as many intriguing questions as there are seconds in the tease, making the most of the beachside back-and-forth," USA Today noted on Jan. 27.

Ro Super Bowl commercial

Telehealth company Ro will air its first Super Bowl ad on Sunday in a spot called "Healthier on Ro," which features former tennis champion Serena Williams talking about her use of a weight-loss medication.

"Ro is using the biggest stage in advertising to pivot the conversation around GLP-1s," PRWeek said.

Rocket Super Bowl commercial

Rocket and its online real estate service Redfin have released a teaser for its Super Bowl commercial, which features black-and-white footage of Lady Gaga singing Mr. Rogers' song "Won't You Be My Neighbor."

The companies are "leaning into something softer for their Big Game teaser," AdWeek wrote. "The candid and unpolished spot, shot with handheld camera work, gives the performance a sense of closeness that mirrors the song's message of kindness and connection."

Skechers Super Bowl commercial

"Modern Family" star Sofía Vergara stars in Skechers' Super Bowl spot, in which none of her other shoes can compare to the comfort of the brand's Hands Free Slip-ins.

The "playful" ad marks Skechers' 13th appearance in the Super Bowl, fashion magazine WWD noted.

Squarespace Super Bowl commercial

Squarespace is back for the Super Bowl, but its teaser, called "Unavailable," doesn't give much away about the ad. The 15-second black-and-white spot features a tearful Emma Stone, although it's unclear why the actor is crying.

The website builder's chief brand and creative officer told Variety last month that the ad will be "very filmic, very cinematic."

Svedka Super Bowl commercial

Vodka brand Svedka is touting its commercial as the first Super Bowl ad created primarily with artificial intelligence. The spot features the vodka brand's Fembot alongside her male counterpart, BroBot, as they pour vodka and dance at a nightclub to the tune of Rick James's "Super Freak."

Food publication Mashed described the commercial as an "AI hellscape."

"The ad ... [is] probably just what you expect: two impossibly shiny and attractive humanoid robots staring at you, dead-eyed, while dancing and making cocktails," Mashed wrote.

Toyota Super Bowl commercial

Toyota's Super Bowl commercial tugs at viewers' heartstrings, putting an emphasis on family connections. It begins with a grandfather buckling his young grandson in the automaker's RAV4 vehicle, calling it his "superhero belt," and ends decades later, with the boy, now a young man, doing the same for his grandfather.

The ad tells "a generational story about family, memory and mundane-yet-memorable moments," AdWeek wrote.

TurboTax Super Bowl commercial

TurboTax's ad will run during the Super Bowl just as millions of Americans are prepping their taxes. The company's teaser, "The Expert," stars actor Adrian Brody repeating the phrase, "I can handle that for you," in different accents.

        <hr/>
        Today I propose taking a respite from our various branching crises to talk about how Spotify built one of its best features in years: prompted playlists, which use AI to effectively leverage years of individual listening data and chatbots’ world knowledge to create the kind of self-updating playlists I have wanted now for years.

(And if that sounds a bit too lightweight, scroll down for some news about Meta’s AI plans.)

Just before the holiday break, Spotify co-CEO Gustav Söderström announced the beta test of prompted playlists. The pitch was straightforward: instead of creating a playlist manually or via individual song suggestions, just type a message out to Spotify and let a large language model assemble one on your behalf.

“You could ask for ‘music from my top artists from the last five years,’ then push it further with ‘and feature deep cuts I haven’t heard yet,’” Söderström wrote. “Or you could request ‘high-energy pop and hip-hop for a 30-minute 5K run that keeps a steady pace before easing into relaxing songs for a cool-down,’ and layer on something like ‘include music from this year’s biggest films and most-talked-about TV shows that match my taste.’ You choose how broad or specific you want to go.”

As it so happened, none of these particular prompts appealed to me. I wanted something much more specific: to recreate the Smart Playlists that have existed in iTunes since 2002.

As a huge music fan, I have long tried to balance listening to new songs with a system to ensure that I regularly revisit old favorites. Smart Playlists made this trivial: I rated the songs in my collection from one to five stars, then used a Smart Playlist to show me four- and five-star songs I hadn’t listened to within the past few months.

The streaming era brought many gifts with it, but Smart Playlists were not one of them. Spotify made some efforts toward highlighting listeners’ most-streamed tracks and rediscovering older songs, such as with its annual Wrapped feature and Throwback Thursday playlists. But if all you wanted was a playlist that showed you an updated list of great songs you hadn’t heard in a while, you were out of luck.

Then, on January 22, prompted playlists entered beta testing in the United States and Canada. When I created my first one last week, I wasn’t certain it would work. None of the prompts Spotify had talked about in their promotional materials had mentioned time-based listening data with the level of granularity I was hoping for.

Still, I gave it a shot. “Create a playlist of songs that I have listened to at least 20 times but haven’t streamed in the past two months.” Spotify went to work, and within a minute or two I had the playlist I was looking for. As I looked over the tracks, it seemed that Spotify really had used the decade-plus of listening data it has on me to find songs I hadn’t heard in months.

The playlist did have its flaws. There was a year where I fell asleep almost every night listening to Sufjan Stevens’ Carrie & Lowell; the first prompted playlist I created included about half of that album. If the playlist was going to be limited to a few dozen tracks, I wanted more variety.

And so, at my boyfriend’s suggestion, I refined the prompt further: “Songs I’ve listened to twenty times but not in the past two months. Please don’t repeat albums. Create a well sequenced playlist drawing from this set, rather than just ranking by play count. Don’t mention play counts in your descriptions.”

This gave me the playlist I actually wanted: one I could just hit “play” on every day without thinking too much about it. The reason is that you can set prompted playlists to update themselves either daily or weekly. (If you choose the latter, you can even pick the day.) This means I now spend less time searching for things and more time listening to music.

I wanted to know more about how prompted playlists worked. And so on Tuesday I met virtually with Molly Holder, Spotify’s head of personalization.

        <hr/>
        For the first time, Spotify is giving users the power to steer the algorithm. Gustav Söderström, Spotify’s Co-President, CPO, and CTO, shares the vision behind Prompted Playlist, and how a new era of listener control is taking shape.

Spotify is entering its next chapter, and it felt worth pausing for a moment to look at how far we’ve come and what comes next. With 713 million listeners, 90% of whom say Spotify is essential to their day, we’re standing on the edge of something big. Equally important is our dedication to delivering real innovation and growth for the artists who leverage the power of Spotify to connect with their fans.

That means pushing ourselves again. Stretching the boundaries of what listening can be. And moving into a new era: one that gives you – the user – more control than ever before.

The next evolution of your Spotify

From the start, we’ve tried to make listening feel personal. You’ve seen that in Discover Weekly and Release Radar, which quietly predict what you might love. You’ve also seen it in the tools that let you shape and refresh your own playlists with precision, such as Smart Shuffle, Playlist song suggestions, and Mixing Tools.

But now we’re entering a moment where you don’t just listen to Spotify, you control it.

Imagine a Spotify that doesn’t just passively learn from you but literally listens to you. One you can steer and shape with your own words. For the first time, your ideas, your logic, and your creativity can actually power the Spotify algorithm, directing how it thinks, adapts, and responds to you.

Introducing Prompted Playlist, where your words bring your playlist to life

Starting December 11, Premium listeners in New Zealand will get early access to our latest beta feature: Prompted Playlist. It’s the first feature that puts control of the algorithm and the broader Spotify experience directly in your hands.

Prompted Playlist lets you describe exactly what you want to hear and set the rules for your personalized playlist. And unlike anything before it, this feature taps into your entire Spotify listening history, all the way back to day one. Each playlist reflects not only what you love today, but the full arc of your taste. Spotify then curates and keeps it fresh based on your listening patterns and world knowledge.

You could ask for “music from my top artists from the last five years,” then push it further with “and feature deep cuts I haven’t heard yet.” Or you could request “high-energy pop and hip-hop for a 30-minute 5K run that keeps a steady pace before easing into relaxing songs for a cool-down,” and layer on something like “include music from this year’s biggest films and most-talked-about TV shows that match my taste.” You choose how broad or specific you want to go.

You can fine-tune the results by editing the prompt, or start fresh whenever you want. And for each song, we’ll include descriptions and context that tell you the story behind the recommendation so the playlist feels alive and crafted specifically for your prompt and your taste.

You can also set it to refresh daily or weekly so your playlist always stays new and in sync with your world. Consider this your chance to curate your next Discover Weekly, exactly the way you want it. Need a little help getting started? Tap “Ideas” to pick from prompts like “songs from artists who are headlining major tours right now,” and get a playlist tailored to your taste.

For even more inspiration, our music editors and culture experts have crafted a set of fun and inventive prompts and English language algorithms that will show up as personalized playlists on Home. And because this is a beta, the experience will evolve as we scale to more listeners. We’re excited to see what we learn along the way.

Why it matters

We believe that technology is only as good as the humans behind it. Spotify listeners have created nearly 9 billion playlists, which is proof that human curation is still the heartbeat of the platform. But until now, unless you were a developer at Spotify and could write your own playlist algorithm, your best ideas might have stayed in your head.

Prompted Playlist brings those ideas to life using just the English language. There’s no longer a tradeoff between control and convenience. You finally get both.

And for artists, this unlocks smarter, more inspired discovery, surfacing their music for the right listeners and opening new ways to deepen their fan bases.

What’s next: More control for you

This new feature is part of a broader shift in how we think about personalization and what we think consumers will expect from their services in the future. Our goal is to make Spotify more personal, more responsive, more intelligent, and more aware of the world and culture around it, in order to bring greater value to listeners, artists, and creators.

This is just the beginning of a new phase where listeners take the lead and make even more of every minute.

        Some days you want your music to reflect a specific feeling, memory, or vibe that goes beyond a single artist or genre. You want to do more than listen. You want to control how curation and discovery work for you.

We believe that technology is only as good as the humans behind it. That’s why we created Prompted Playlist, which lets you describe exactly what you want to listen to using your own words, then generates a playlist informed by your listening history and what’s happening in music right now. It’s a new way to put meaningful control of the algorithm directly in your hands, with your ideas, your logic, and your creativity. Think of it more as collaboration, not automation: You set the rules, and Spotify works from there.

You’re not just asking for music, you’re shaping how Spotify goes about discovering it for you. That might mean fresher tracks and emerging artists only, deeper cuts based on what you already love, specific genres to include or exclude, or playlists shaped around cultural moments. In other words, you can design discovery around exactly what you’re in the mood for, from your own take on Discover Weekly to something entirely new.

In December 2025, we began testing Prompted Playlist with Premium listeners in New Zealand, and music fans have been quick to get creative. Listeners are using prompts to bring back songs tied to specific moments, like late nights during the winter, while filtering out tracks they’ve overplayed recently. Others are asking for long, lyric-free electronic playlists to power through a workday, or mixing in artists connected to current pop culture moments and viral trends.

Now, we’re excited to share Prompted Playlist with more Premium listeners in beta across the U.S. and Canada starting today.

Prompted Playlist builds on a simple question: What do you want to hear?

You can start broad and request, “mood-boosting indie-pop for getting ready to go out with friends including songs recently featured on hit competition and reality shows that fit my taste, along with songs I love but haven’t played this year.” Or begin with a scenario like, “warm acoustic songs for a slow Sunday morning, plus hidden gems and covers from singer-songwriters trending globally right now.”

Once you share what you’re looking for, Spotify generates your playlist using real-time information about the world of music, including trends, charts, culture, and history. Your entire listening history from when you first joined Spotify is factored in, meaning each playlist reflects not only what you love today, but the full arc of your taste. Discover new artists and revisit the favorites who’ve shaped your listening. And when you’re ready for something different, you can guide the algorithm in a whole new direction.

You can edit your prompt anytime, or start fresh whenever inspiration hits. You can also choose to set it to refresh daily or weekly so your playlist always stays new and in sync with your world. Every song includes a quick one-liner that tells you exactly why it landed in your playlist. Need help getting started? Tap “Ideas” for quick inspiration.

“We hear from listeners all the time that they love playlists, but making their own can feel daunting,” said Sulinna Ong, Global Head of Editorial. “Our editors spend a lot of time thoughtfully curating playlists, and that level of intention can be hard to replicate when you’re starting from scratch. Prompted Playlist offers a more intuitive entry point, letting users begin with moods, moments, or ideas in their own words, and build something that feels personal.”

If you think I am crazy for renting a car and driving three hours out of New York—through the Holland Tunnel, onto the New Jersey Turnpike, and across the Susquehanna River—just to eat at a Pizza Hut, know that I’m far from the only person who has made the trip. There are more than 6,000 Pizza Huts dotting the thoroughfares of the United States, and almost all of them look exactly the same: The interiors are squat, bland, and cramped; the dining options are restricted to takeout and delivery; there is no soundtrack, save for fluorescent lights buzzing overhead; and there is maybe a lonely chair waiting listlessly by the doorway. But the location in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania, is different. It stands tall in a strip-mall parking lot, boasting a regal red-shingled roof, as one of the country’s last remaining sit-down Pizza Huts. And for a certain type of beleaguered American, beset by the crackup of the 2020s and desperate to be swaddled in a warm 20th-century embrace, that has made the restaurant worthy of pilgrimage.

It was weekday lunchtime when I arrived on a chilly January day, and a real live waitress guided me to one of the waxy booths lining the tinted windows—a checkerboard linen flaring off the corners of the table in front of me. I hadn’t been to a Pizza Hut in years, but relics of mid-’90s pizza parties immediately consumed my periphery. Above me hung a Tiffany-style lamp with the restaurant’s name embossed in creamy frosted glass. The waitress dropped off a menu—a menu!—and a pebbled red plastic cup fizzing with Diet Coke. There was a fully stocked salad bar where anyone could drench their shredded carrots, canned olives, and iceberg lettuce with ladlefuls of ranch. A woman at the table next to me ordered a cup of coffee, an indulgence that would be literally inconceivable at any other Pizza Hut.

My lunch took the form of a medium supreme pie, served in a cast-iron pan charred by countless trips through the conveyor oven. I peeled off one sloppy slice with a spatula; the distinct Pizza Hut flavor profile seemed to be amplified by the environs. (Buttery crust, sweet tomatoes, gratuitous cheese-to-sauce ratio.) Meanwhile, Paul Bender—the restaurant’s burly shift manager, with sailor tattoos carved into his tree-trunk forearms—piled into the opposite side of my booth. In the near future, said Bender, he’d like to install a jukebox, and perhaps even one of those cocktail Pac-Man cabinets, to make this Pizza Hut even more characteristic of the past. “Something is in the air,” he told me of his restaurant’s unlikely consecration as a tourist destination. “We’ve had visitors from Florida and Canada. I’m just like, Wow. I don’t think there’s any restaurant I’d personally drive eight hours to go see, but God bless.”

The Tunkhannock Pizza Hut was invisible on the national atlas for most of its history, but Bender told me that changed overnight last May, when a post made on a Facebook page called “Just Pennsylvania” touted the restaurant’s majesty. (“It’s like stepping straight into 1987,” exclaimed the caption attached to a slideshow of the restaurant’s retro features. “No touchscreen kiosks, no sleek redesign, just the classic dine-in Hut experience you thought was gone forever.”) The post accrued 7,500 shares, and quickly broke containment outside the rural Northeast. TikTok swiftly billowed up with clips filmed by nostalgia hounds delighting in the pre-millennium charm, loading up on gratuitous salads and unlimited refills. Food vloggers, equipped with tiny microphones, took flight—examining mozzarella distribution and breadstick crispness, breathing life into long-discarded sense memories. The floodgates had burst wide open. By the holidays, Bender said that his Pizza Hut was routinely bombarded by enough diners to have 20-minute waits, composed mostly of out-of-towners like me. On a slow night, Bender says his location rakes in $10,000 a night.

It’s not hard to understand the appeal. If you are a child of the 1990s, 1980s, or 2000s, then there is a good chance that Pizza Hut—of this vintage variety—intersects with some core recollections. Naturally, the people documenting the Tunkhannock location homed in on the same trinkets that I did—the campy chandeliers, the ribbed Coke glasses, the pressed tablecloth, all of which have been reified in the cultural archive. (Among the most upvoted posts in the history of the subreddit r/Nostalgia, there is an unadorned photo of the now-extinct Pizza Hut lunch buffet. “I would pay $100 to relive that for a day,” reads one top comment.)

What is more curious to me, however, is how these inconsequential consumer niceties have become synonymous with a glacial sense of decline. There seems to be this understanding that Pizza Hut, at its height, emblemized a bygone golden age—the American Century in miniature. Just days ago, a tweet went viral showcasing a 1997 Pizza Hut commercial that aired in Russia. It stars former president of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev, shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The thesis of the clip? Thank god the United States won the Cold War, because if it didn’t, Russia wouldn’t have Pizza Hut. I, too, can remember an age when the restaurant felt integral to our national infrastructure. The sensation is potent enough to summon my fellow countrymen to the middle of nowhere in order to sample what they think has been taken from them. Is Pizza Hut a barometer for the ebbing American self-image? Bender seems to think so.

“What I get the biggest kick out of is people my age who remember the old times and bring their kids in. The kids might not care, but the parents love showing them around and telling them about their memories,” said Bender. Against the wall hangs a poster for Pizza Hut’s BOOK IT! program—a 1990s-era initiative in which schoolchildren were rewarded for hitting reading goals with a personal pan pizza. Bender told me that tourists love posing for photos with that poster. It reminds them of a gentler age.

“Maybe some people don’t get it, but I do,” he said. “There’s enough going on in this world right now. But here you can have a pizza to yourself for a half hour.”

There’s just one problem with this premise. The Tunkhannock Pizza Hut is not quite as authentic as it appears.

Over the last several years, Pizza Hut corporate leadership has slowly restored a handful of its restaurants in the style of the company’s analog-era golden age. Collectively, these locations are branded as “Pizza Hut Classic.” The Tunkhannock restaurant is one of them, making it an accessory to an advertising campaign. Nobody seems to know how many Pizza Hut Classics exist, how long this strategy has been employed, or if the company plans on adding more in the future. (Pizza Hut didn’t respond to my request for comment, nor have they spoken to anyone else who has covered the initiative.) But Bender provided some insight. He mentioned that his franchise has always been a sit-down affair, retaining its diner bones throughout innumerable rebrands and pivots. About 10 years ago, his bosses fully converted the restaurant into an official, bona fide Classic. The corporate office shipped over a bevy of 1990s accoutrements, including cups, lamps, and a plaque emblazoned with a quote from Dan Carney, Pizza Hut’s co-founder, that was to be pinned up in the beige foyer.

“This Pizza Hut Classic celebrates our heritage,” the inscription reads. “It reminds us of the Pizza Hut where generations first fell in love with pizza. We’re so happy to have you here; we hope you fall in love all over again.”

The national Pizza Hut apparatus has refused to tabulate an official directory of Pizza Hut Classics. There is not a shred of information about these vintage establishments on the company website. Instead, the locations are uncovered by dedicated Pizza Hut wayfarers and fetishists as a kind of scavenger hunt. The Classics all appear to be located in small towns—Tunkhannock has a population of only 1,727—with the lion’s share situated in the boondocks of Texas, the state where the restaurant is headquartered. Rolando Pujol, a New York–based journalist who takes a special interest in throwback American kitsch, has curated the only definitive list of Pizza Hut Classics on his Substack, The Retrologist. It is, by leagues, the highest-traffic piece of writing he’s ever published on the internet.

“I’ve worked for television stations, I’ve worked for some of America’s best newspapers, I’ve written a book, but this index of Pizza Huts is the one thing that has resonated more than anything else, and that has to mean something,” said Pujol. He joked about the sheer number of customers he’s driven to the Classics: “At some point I’m going to sit down with Pizza Hut with an actuary and a lawyer, and figure out how much business I’ve generated for them.”

The upshot is a promotional tactic that transforms Pizza Hut into something close to a secular shrine—Shangri-La for Americans looking to nourish their inner child. Melissa Farenish, a 49-year-old who helps run a nostalgia-aggregating Facebook group called “Capturing Moments and Memories: Retail of Today and Yesterday,” led a legitimate caravan to the Tunkhannock location last July. Members of the group, from all over the Northeast, converged upon the restaurant; some were delighted to discover that another 1990s archaism—a McDonald’s with an intact PlayPlace—awaited just across the street. Farenish was motivated to make the trip due to what she refers to as the victimization of her local Pizza Hut in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. She patronized the restaurant with her family for decades until the forces of capitalism hollowed it out for good. Today, the location serves pizza on paper plates and sodas in plastic bottles.

“I was really sad when they took the jukebox out, because as a kid that was always my chance to play DJ on a Friday night,” said Farenish. “There’s just a lot of amenities that have been taken out over the years. A lot of things like that are gone. And I’m not sure why.”

Everyone who has visited a Classic has some version of this story. Jonathan Stutzman, a children’s author, was on a book tour in Charlevoix, Michigan, when a sit-down Pizza Hut materialized on the horizon. He slouched into his booth, shoulder propped against the cool brick wall, and feasted on a personal cheese pie wedged into quarters. When I asked what drew him to the restaurant, Stutzman, like Bender, gestured toward this general sense of societal malaise. “After all the craziness of the last six years, we yearn for cozy memories,” he said. But Stutzman is also of the opinion that life in the 2020s has grown increasingly remote. So remote, in fact, that going out for Pizza Hut amounts to a radical act.

“We’re all in the digital age. Everything is on screens. Nothing is personal anymore. Even a lot of friendships exist online,” said Stutzman. “And I think being in a Pizza Hut like this reminds you of the warmth, and the joys of community, of a chaotic space. I do miss the tactile nature of the past.”

Something similar has been on my mind in the weeks since my lunch in Tunkhannock. For much of my youth, Pizza Hut prided itself on being a third space for Little League post-game meals and elementary school graduation parties. And that makes it a little strange that, with this Classic promotion, the brand has fully embraced the generation-wide consensus that its restaurants were once far less austere than they are currently. Of course, cold-blooded business analysts could just as easily make the case that the company never had much of a choice.

Last year, the National Restaurant Association reported that a mind-boggling 75 percent of restaurant traffic comes from takeout orders. US Foods, a restaurant supplier, corroborated that trend—according to the firm’s research, more than half of Americans prefer to eat at home, rather than in a commercial dining room, a trend certainly bolstered by the fact that restaurant meals have significantly jumped in price since the pandemic. Pizza Hut has historically been perched on the extremes of this dynamic—90 percent of the company’s revenue is derived outside of its brick-and-mortar locations, which is itself a strategy the brand helped pioneer. (Pizza Hut launched “PizzaNet”—a prototype online ordering apparatus—in 1994. Some speculate that a Pizza Hut pizza was the very first item sold through an e-commerce platform.) Diners have spoken: They want their meals placed into brown paper bags and left on welcome mats by DoorDash drivers. The customers have disappeared from the restaurants. No wonder the ambiance has withered.

After all, Pizza Hut is far from the only fast-food brand to make those concessions. The vast majority of new locations opened by the brand are “delco” stores—as in, establishments built specifically for delivery and carry-out. They typically amount to a cash register and a hub for idling cars. Human beings are expected to be on the premises for 10 minutes or less. Restaurants around the country have followed suit by purging their cosmetic flourishes. The technicolor jungle gyms of McDonald’s have long been packed away in storage. Replacing them are stumpy brown buildings tiled with uncanny, body-scale computer terminals. The ordering process has been streamlined to eliminate all potential human interactions: Tap in the food you want to eat and wait for the number to be called. You never even need to take off your headphones.

What have we lost in this sea change? Nothing concrete. Nothing I can name, or touch with my hands. Instead, I simply detect this phantasmal darkness—a humanity-wide dissatisfaction—whenever I scan a QR code laminated on my table to make my order. One of the most uncanny features of the Tunkhannock Pizza Hut was the gallery of blown-up photographs, sourced from the ‘70s, ‘80s, and ‘90s, that were fastened to the wall. Each of them captured a scene from the brand’s bygone vitality. A young boy, dizzy with joy and crowned with a party hat, celebrates a birthday. A gang of teenagers scarf down a weeknight meal before getting up to no good. It was a grim tribute to all that seems to have gone missing from the restaurant, like Pizza Hut had built a mausoleum to itself.

There is a term people like to throw around these days called “enshittification.” It was coined in 2022 by the technology blogger Cory Doctorow, and it elucidates the idea that the American marketplace has grown steadily more hostile toward its participants. Enshittification occurs when a subscription service triples in price, or when a gym membership tier suddenly plummets in value. I’ve never totally been comfortable with the concept. It’s an attempt to diagnose the root of our discontent, but it seems uncouth to interlace human dignity with human consumption. Surely, the meaning of life ought to be determined outside of chain restaurants. But I will tell you this: After I finished my meal in Tunkhannock, I wandered over to a table and spoke to Angela and Roy White, a married couple in their early 40s enjoying a pair of pepperoni pizzas. The two of them grew up there in town, but had since moved one county north. Angela pointed across the dining room toward an empty table. It was there, she said, that she and Roy had their first date.

I pondered the thousands—millions?—of couples just like them, whose love story began in a Pizza Hut, because Pizza Hut used to be a place where you could go on a first date. I am not claiming that the restaurant is a civic institution. But once upon a time, Pizza Hut was filled with other people, and being around other people does the soul good.

“My parents didn’t have much money, but we loved coming here on Saturday nights,” Angela said to me. “I always sat in the same spot. The waiters all knew my name. Everyone was here.”

A soft wintry dusk encroaches upon northeastern Pennsylvania. I’ve got a long night ahead of me; it’s a three-hour drive back to Brooklyn. But before I leave town, I find myself orbiting back to the Pizza Hut, which is now ablaze in yellow sodium light. I pass through the glass doors and wander toward the same booth I sat in previously. There isn’t much of a rush tonight, from either the locals or out-of-towners. Instead, the tables are occupied by roving high-schoolers and young families, all from the streets of Tunkhannock. A blissed-out kindergartner slathers breadsticks in marinara sauce; a flock of chirping retirees take turns at the salad bar. I’ve ordered another pizza—pepperoni and onion—to take back home. The serifed Pizza Hut logo, illuminated in angelic white, shrinks from view as I merge onto the freeway. Now and forever, dinner is served.

        A YouTuber’s self-financed and self-distributed sci-fi horror film is overturning industry expectations after it made it big at the box office over the weekend.

“Iron Lung,” an indie video game adaptation from YouTuber Mark Fischbach (better known as Markiplier), pulled in $18.19 million at the domestic box office on opening weekend, according to final figures from Comscore. That’s more than six times its reported $3 million budget.

The film, which Fischbach wrote and directed, played in 3,015 theaters across the U.S. and Canada. It came in a close second to the Sam Raimi-directed horror-thriller “Send Help,” which took the top slot at the box office by amassing $19.1 million domestically. It also surpassed the Amazon MGM Studios release “Melania: Twenty Days to History," a documentary following the first lady, which rolled out in over 1,500 theaters in North America.

A growing spectrum of creators — from Addison Rae to MrBeast— have leveraged their social media prowess to make headway in traditional film, TV or music. Fischbach has more than 38 million subscribers on YouTube, where he has built a massive brand around his gaming playthrough and commentary videos since he joined it in 2012.

“To see really savvy creators and influencers ... parlay their small-screen YouTube success either onto traditional television or onto the big screen is remarkable, and I think we’re going to see more of it,” said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore’s head of marketplace trends. “You never know where the next big hit is going to come from.”

Based on a 2022 sci-fi horror game of the same name, the movie follows a convict, Simon, who must pilot a submarine on a faraway moon, navigating its ocean of blood after an apocalyptic event caused all planets and star systems to vanish.

Fischbach stars as Simon, alongside fellow YouTuber Seán William McLoughlin (better known as Jacksepticeye), who also played the original 2022 game on his channel.

The game’s creator, David Szymanski, appeared shocked at the film’s popularity, posting “What the f---” on X.

In a YouTube livestream Sunday, Fischbach also got emotional seeing the box office numbers. Competing with the likes of Raimi, he said on the stream, felt like “kind of a hero moment to showcase indie filmmaking is possible.”

“And maybe if that could inspire someone to keep making films, that’d be pretty cool,” he said, composing himself through tears. “And maybe if it could open up a door for other people to do their projects independently and know that there could be success in it, I think that’d be pretty cool. I think that might be actually really cool.”

Like many who ventured from YouTube into traditional Hollywood, Fischbach has used his platform to experiment with professional filmmaking. He wrote and directed the YouTube Original comedy films “A Heist with Markiplier” (2019) and “In Space with Markiplier” (2022).

In an industry that often puts the rise of YouTube and streaming in competition with movie theaters, Dergarabedian said, “Iron Lung” provides some evidence that the two can instead be viewed as complementary experiences. There’s a place for streaming, he said, but people still go to movie theaters for a unique big-screen experience.

The box office hit also stirred some discussion online about the potential for digital creators to wade into professional filmmaking. An X user wrote that Fischbach “has opened doors for other youtubers/content creators to be taken seriously within the film world,” adding that the film industry “better be taking notes.”

On Tuesday, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan praised Fischbach's accomplishment.

"Incredible to see @youtubecreators like @Markiplier holding the keys to their own production and distribution," he wrote in a post on X. "This is the new era of Hollywood."

Despite its relatively low budget and small marketing effort, Fischbach’s movie had a few factors working in its favor, Dergarabedian said. It opened after a relatively quiet January for theaters, and horror as a genre has drawn high interest over the past year — 2025 was the biggest year ever for horror movies at the box office.

Still, its success surprised many. Dergarabedian said the film could become a blueprint for others aiming to execute self-financed films, which rarely make it into theaters in the first place.

“Usually, movies have to have a long run-up in terms of marketing and awareness-building to have success in a movie theater,” he said. “But this is breaking all the rules.”

        When it comes to deciding where to vacation, the usual suspects, like the number of nice hotels, attractions, and places to eat, are important to consider. But it's also vital to understand the basics, too—like the safety of a new place. Thankfully, travel insurance provider Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection recently released its rankings of the safest cities in the world to visit and live in.

For its study, BHTP combed through feedback from more than 1,500 American travelers who ranked cities they had personally visited across multiple safety factors, including crime, terrorism risk, emergency services, health standards, and inclusivity. After crunching all the data, Iceland's capital, Reykjavik, took the top spot for safety from violent crime, ranking ahead of cities like Seoul, Dubai, Honolulu, and Copenhagen.

Reykjavik has earned a global reputation as one of the safest cities to visit and live in, and the latest study reinforces that status. In the capital and throughout Iceland, violent crime is extremely rare, and serious offenses like assault and robbery are far less frequent than in many major urban centers around the world. With a population of roughly 135,000, Reykjavik benefits from its small size, which encourages community connection, high social trust, and a strong social safety net. Many neighborhoods in Reykjavik are also recognized by the safety index provider GeoSure as being uniformly secure.

Strolling through Reykjavik’s compact city center, travelers can explore colorful streets lined with charming cafes, boutique shops, and the unmistakable Hallgrímskirkja church, an Expressionist structure designed to mimic Iceland’s basalt lava flows. Travelers can attend a concert or performance at the waterfront Harpa Concert Hall and Conference Centre, then walk to the nearby Sun Voyager sculpture for scenic views of the bay. Museums, such as the National Museum of Iceland and the Reykjavík Art Museum, offer deep insights into the country's history and culture.

Just outside Reykjavik, travelers have easy access to some of Iceland’s most iconic natural attractions. Popular destinations include the relaxing geothermal pools of the Blue Lagoon and Sky Lagoon, the volcanic landscapes and waterfalls along the Golden Circle route, and massive glaciers like Langjökull and Vatnajökull, Europe’s largest glacier. During the wintertime, travelers can witness the Northern Lights and explore crystal ice caves, while in the warmer months, they can see the Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon and Diamond Beach. Those with more time can comfortably drive the entire Ring Road in about 10 days.

        Over the past month, the Trump administration has deployed thousands of federal immigration agents to the Minneapolis area. On Saturday, Jan. 24, federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Pretti was the third person shot by federal agents in the area in January.

The Department of Homeland Security initially said an agent fired “defensive shots” after Pretti approached officers with a weapon, but video of the incident appears to contradict that claim. DHS said this week that two officers involved were placed on leave. In a press conference on Thursday, border czar Tom Homan said the administration is working on making the operation “safer, more efficient, by the book.” He said that agents will focus on “targeted, strategic enforcement operations” with a “prioritization on public safety threats.”

Our photojournalists Cengiz Yar and Peter DiCampo were on the ground in Minneapolis, covering what they saw in the days before and after Pretti’s death. Read their accounts below.

Cengiz Yar

I arrived in Minneapolis last week to report on the crackdown and how local residents were reacting.

I had packed my medical kit, full face respirator, helmet and a couple tourniquets, essentials for my reporting bag when I make trips to dangerous and potentially violent areas. I also brought layers upon layers of warm clothing, as temperatures were expected to drop to 20 below in the coming days. I knew the ICE raids and the community’s response had been intense across the region, but I wasn’t fully prepared for what I’d end up seeing playing out in the streets.

In my few days in Minnesota, I’ve been witness to countless scenes that remind me of moments I’ve seen during previous trips covering conflicts around the world. I watched heavily armored federal units roll through quiet neighborhoods. In a grocery store parking lot, angry residents screamed at agents, demanding they leave the city. Masked and armed government agents pointed weapons toward me and some protesters during an encounter in the middle of the afternoon. Curious guests in a hotel elevator wondered why I was carrying around a medical pack and gas mask. Local residents thanked me for being there to witness the situation. A drunk man at a hotel bar cursed at me, saying the media was at fault. The wars we’ve carried out as a nation abroad have come home.

On my first day out reporting, I came upon an incident that had been unfolding for over an hour. Late in the afternoon on Thursday, Jan. 22, three construction workers clung to a roof, bracing themselves against the slanted plywood of an unfinished two-story house on the far south side of Minneapolis. Federal agents had massed in the house and in cars on the street, conducting a raid on the construction site. The agents called for the workers to come down. They refused. They stayed on the roof, exposed to the elements in negative 4 degree weather.

I stood outside the house looking up at the men on the roof, wondering how they were surviving in only high-visibility vests and work clothing. Onlookers begged the agents to let them bring the men blankets. They were told to stay out of the building.

Other construction workers milled about the snow-covered site as their co-workers hung on above. Some cursed at the officers. One worker told the men to come down before they freeze to death. “You can at least go to a warm cell,” he shouted. One young, white worker stuck his middle finger in the face of agents idling in their car. “Fuck you,” he screamed as he stomped around the site. A half dozen onlookers had assembled as well, shouting encouragement to the men above and asking the agents for compassion.

The three men remained on the roof as the young, white construction worker argued angrily with the agents for almost an hour.

Finally, as the time approached 5 p.m., the agents left.

Onlookers rushed into the building and brought the men down to wrap them in blankets. “You’re OK now,” they reassured the men. “You did great.”

On Friday, I arrived in South Minneapolis as protesters gathered, shouting, filming and blowing whistles at armored agents in a pickup. After a few minutes, the agents threw tear gas into the small crowd of onlookers and sped away. Gas drifted through the snowy streets, passing cute two-story houses and short, leafless trees. My throat burning, I crouched to the ground, coughing up the irritants behind a snowbank.

I couldn’t have known that less than a day later, in a similar situation, Customs and Border Protection agents would kill a man by shooting him multiple times in the back as they pinned him to the ground. Pretti died while filming agents and trying to help a woman as he was pepper sprayed. In the unfolding chaos in the hours after the shooting, I watched as agents unloaded tear gas on a couple hundred furious protesters who had assembled at the site of the shooting. Heavily armored law enforcement faced off against a crowd of unarmed protesters carrying signs and screaming for justice and retribution.

It was 9:07 a.m. on Saturday morning when I learned that someone had been shot outside Glam Doll Donuts on Nicollet Avenue. It would be hours before I heard the name Alex Pretti and watched the grisly videos of CBP agents shooting him to death. But knowing that Minneapolis was on edge following the death of Renee Good, also killed by federal agents, I grabbed my camera and the warmest clothing I could find. I rushed out of my house. By 9:29 a.m., I was in my car texting a group of fellow photographers “omw.”

Yellow police tape and federal agents lined the scene of the shooting, keeping everyone about a block away in every direction. A small crowd gathered. The first person I recognized wasn’t another journalist, it was my neighbor. “Peter!” she cried, and told me she wasn’t sure what was happening, just that she had also heard about the shooting and wanted to get down there. She sobbed into my arms for a minute, then we parted ways.

More agents gathered. Many wore gas masks. More residents and others ready to protest another killing arrived. A young man stood at the edge of the yellow tape and yelled; an older woman hugged him to try to calm him down. The anger of the crowd was palpable. “ICE agents: Get out of Minneapolis,” they screamed.

I do not have the words to articulate how it feels to watch this unfold in Minneapolis, a city that I have grown to know and love after moving here a few years ago. The journalists who flocked here over the past few weeks are people I have run into while on assignment in hot spots all over the world. Now they were in my home city.

As crowds grew, agents fired tear gas to keep them back. Crowds would then briefly disperse, but some agents would grab and detain people regardless. The crowds reformed quickly, and the cycle of tear gas, detentions and regrouping continued.

After one bout of tear gas, I stumbled away, doubled over and coughing. “Come inside!” I heard someone yell. I looked up and saw a woman opening the door to an apartment building. She wasn’t yelling to me but to two photographers I know. I stumbled toward them, and the three of them saw me, and all extended the invitation: “Come inside!”

I was grateful to be out of the tear gas, and I was grateful to be warm. That day’s high temperature was well below zero; at one point, I looked down and realized frozen condensation had iced my camera dials and buttons in place.

The other two photographers and I made our way to the rooftop and spent the next hour-plus photographing from above. We overlooked the scene of the shooting and could see the FBI examining it and the line of protesters and agents going back and forth in three different directions.

We watched as the federal presence finished at the shooting scene and packed up. They slowly backed out, firing tear gas at protesters who ran at them as they drove away.

We went back down to the street. Protesters gathered at the next block, and a similar scene played out there, this time with city and state police. “Why aren’t you protecting us?” one person yelled at them. Another protestor tried to calm the crowd down, but people were fed up: “Fuck your pacifism,” I heard someone yell.

Tear gas was fired, people dispersed and the police slowly backed out. Eventually, without federal agents and police around, the mood shifted from chaos to something more somber.

As I took a moment to breathe, I realized that the final standoff had taken place right in front of Cheapo Records, where I went record shopping on my birthday a couple years back. And the events of the entire day — the shooting, the protests, the tear gassing — all unfolded on a stretch of Nicollet Avenue called Eat Street, known for having many of the best restaurants in town, with cuisines from all over the world that showcase the city’s diversity. I knew then that walking these streets would never feel the same.

People made their way to the site of Alex Pretti’s death. There was still yellow tape around it, now tied haphazardly around trash cans. A small bloodstain was visible on the pavement.

Quietly, they began to build a memorial.

        After wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park, cougars — that had only regained a foothold a few decades earlier — were able to coexist due to their diets changing and the varied landscape of the park, according to new research.

Run-ins between wolves (Canis lupus) and cougars (Puma concolor, also called mountain lions and pumas) in Yellowstone National Park happen when wolves steal prey from — and sometimes kill — cougars, and this dynamic becomes more harmonious when cougars shift to eating smaller prey, according to a new study published Jan. 26 in the journal PNAS. Successful wolf and cougar coexistence in Yellowstone, the findings suggest, depends more on the diversity of prey and the availability of escape terrain for cougars than it does on the overall abundance of prey.

"Yellowstone is a fascinating system because it's got the full complement of large carnivores and migratory ungulates that North America used to have," Chris Wilmers, a wildlife ecologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz who was not involved in the new study, told Live Science. "A lot of these species are coming back –– wolves were reintroduced, mountain lions and grizzly bear numbers have been recovering –– so it's also a system that's in flux. As these populations restore themselves, it's super interesting to look at these species' effects on each other."

Cougar and wolf habitats are increasingly overlapping in the western United States. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, both species were nearly eradicated from the U.S. due primarily to hunting. Cougar populations began to rebound in the 1960s under new protections, and wolf reintroduction began in the 1990s and benefited from expanded legal protection.

Both species are now prevalent throughout the western U.S., but scientists are still working to understand the animals' population dynamics and their impacts on the broader Yellowstone ecosystem.

The new study analyzed nine years of GPS data from collared wolves and cougars, combined with field observations at almost 4,000 sites throughout Yellowstone. The researchers found that wolves occasionally kill cougars, but cougars do not kill wolves.

These findings align with previous work that showed wolves were the more dominant large carnivore in this food web, even though the two species have similar body sizes. Wolves likely dominate because they move in packs, whereas cougars are solitary, which means wolves can run cougars off and steal their prey, said lead study author Wesley Binder, a doctoral student in the Department of Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Sciences at Oregon State University.

"These interactions are very one-sided," Binder told Live Science. "But cougars have the ability to adapt in some ways."

Both cougars' and wolves' diets are changing, according to the new findings: Between 1998 and 2024, elk went from constituting 95% to 64% of wolf diets, and from 80% to 53% of cougar diets, likely because Yellowstone elk (Cervus canadensis) populations are decreasing more broadly.

This decline led to changes in wolf and cougar interactions. "If cougars kill larger prey like elk, that gives wolves more time to find the cougar sitting on that kill," Binder said. "We found that wolves and cougars were six times more likely to interact when cougars killed elk, compared to deer. Deer are less than half the size of elk, so cougars eat them a lot faster, and wolves have a lot less opportunity to discover those kill sites."

Shifting cougar diets from declining elk numbers led to fewer interactions with wolves overall. Instead of elk, cougars began eating smaller prey, like deer. Wolves, they found, started eating more bison.

"It's important to realize that's why the cougars switched, but in doing so, it made them less vulnerable to scavenging and potentially getting killed by wolves," Wilmers said.

The terrain, the findings showed, also shapes the animals' encounters. When surrounded by rugged terrain or trees they can climb, cougars had fewer dangerous encounters with wolves.

Yellowstone's diversity of both prey and landscapes seems to be a sweet spot for wolf-cougar coexistence. Both species' populations are currently stable. "Wolves and cougars prefer different habitat, and Yellowstone has different habitat that suits each of these carnivores," Binder said.

The findings reveal the ideal landscape and prey characteristics for the stable coexistence of two large carnivore species — and how clashes between predators can have a ripple effect on the whole ecosystem.

"We're always trying to understand what the impact is of large carnivores on prey [populations]," Wilmers said, "and what the interactions are between the large carnivores, and how they might combine or cancel out each other's influence on prey. … It's the beginning of unraveling that story between wolves and [cougars]."

        <hr/>
        In the generative AI boom, vibe coding and AI expertise have become in-demand résumé skills. But tech companies are also looking to pay a premium for expertise in people who have a skill that predates AI: the art of communication.

Andreessen Horowitz launched its New Media team last year to help founders learn what they "need to win the narrative battle online." Adobe is looking for an "AI evangelist" to lead the company's "artificial intelligence storytelling." Netflix, a company that sells stories to your living room, recently posted a director of product and technology communications role with a salary range of up to $775,000. Microsoft began publishing a print magazine, Signal, last year, calling it an "antidote to the ephemeral nature of digital." Anthropic tripled the size of its communications team last year, growing to about 80 people and is still hiring five more, each offering salaries of around $200,000 or higher. OpenAI has several open communications jobs boasting salary listings of more than $400,000. The average director of communications in the US makes $106,000, according to Indeed.

Three years after the mainstream adoption of ChatGPT, results have been mixed: Within tech firms, vibe coding is nixing the need for entry-level software developers, while some workers across industries are foisting rapidly generated, verbose, and sloppy AI nonsense onto their colleagues, leading to wasted time and a breakdown of trust. Even Sam Altman said last year that people have started to affect a sort of AI accent when speaking, and now some social platform discourse "feels very fake."

Amid all chatter about gen AI taking jobs, the ease with which gen AI spits out content has ironically revved the demand for human communicators.

Because AI generates so much content, "you would think that actually the job of the comms person or the storyteller would be fewer and farther between," says Gab Ferree, founder of Off the Record, a community for communications professionals, and former vice president of global communications at Bumble. But that's not what's happening. Tech companies are hiring writers, editors, chief communications officers who work closely with CEOs, and so-called "storytellers." The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the percentage of job postings on LinkedIn mentioning "storyteller" doubled between 2024 to 2025.

In a competitive industry where startups fight to survive and Big Tech rivals campaign for market dominance, a good story is a selling point. One theory behind the push, Ferree says, is "there's just so much garbage out there that people want to pay a premium for someone who can claim that they can cut through the noise."

The trend of storytelling and lucrative comms jobs has been "percolating for a while," says Jenna Birch, founder of SISU, a communications consultancy for startups and VCs. As Silicon Valley's influence ballooned over the past two decades, tech companies could offer staggering salaries just as more newspapers were bleeding more and more writers. Content marketing became popular, and building a company's brand on social media and surfacing blog posts in Google search results became essential.

More recently, the role of the comms pro has continued to expand, as they have to understand large language models, company blogs, how to craft a larger narrative to set a company apart from competitors, and how to write in a CEO's voice on LinkedIn and Substack. The number of chief communication officer roles that encompass not just traditional comms duties but also take on another responsibility, like marketing or or human resources, at Fortune 1000 companies grew from 90 in 2019 to 169 in 2024, according to a report from the Observatory on Corporate Reputation. The median pay for a CCO at a Fortune 500 company is now between $400,000 and $450,000, a $50,000 jump from 2023, according to a survey from consultant firm Korn Ferry.

If everyone's a writer, then nobody's a writer, and I think it's very evident right now.Cristin Culver, founder of Common Thread Communications

As the job changes and demand for narrative communications and storytellers rises, the number of communications experts able to work under rapidly evolving conditions and with a wide remit may be small, comms experts tell me, leading companies to offer hefty compensation packages in war for the best talent. A similar trend is unfolding among the few people who are AI experts, driving tech companies to offer astounding salaries to poach top talent from rival firms. While not of the same nine-figure caliber, in their own right, creatives are becoming "the high value person in tech now," Birch says.

For much of the tech boom, that high-value person was a software developer. Universities and coding bootcamps rushed to fill employment gaps and train up the next generation of tech workers. Young people were told coding would be a path to a lucrative, stable career. As of 2023, the most recent year the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released data for, computer science recent graduates faced an unemployment rate of 6.1%, while communications majors' unemployment rate sat at 4.5%. The number of open job posts for software engineers dropped by more than 60,000 between 2023 and late 2025, according to data from CompTIA, a nonprofit trade association for the US IT industry. The best defense against automation, some argue, will be a liberal arts degree.

Words might be easy to generate with AI, but good writing isn't ready for automation.

"If everyone's a writer, then nobody's a writer, and I think it's very evident right now," says Cristin Culver, founder of communications firm Common Thread Communications. LinkedIn is full of posts written by AI in a similar style that makes eyes glaze over as they scroll. "I think AI is both aiding and making storytelling much harder," Culver says. "Ironically in this era of AI, some of the most poignant storytelling belongs to the people who've realized that everything is sloppified and they've pivoted to very tactical storytelling."

Anthropic has been leaning heavily into that tactical, and tactile, storytelling. In the fall, the company created a pop-up Claude Cafe in New York to position the chatbot as a thinking and problem solving partner, marketing the space as one for showing up in person, connecting, and being surrounded by books and magazines over screens (although the company has also destroyed and scanned millions of books to train Claude, which a judge ruled last year was not a copyright violation).

"Claude is definitely a prominent team member for everyone, but comms people are sort of like BS detectors," Sasha de Marigny previously told Axios last May, months before she was promoted from head of communications to become the company's first CCO. "Critical thinking is still a huge comparative advantage for humans. I'm looking for excellent strategists — people who understand the new world order and know how to develop holistic plans to cut through to the audiences we care about." Anthropic declined to speak more about its comms strategy for this story.

"It's a golden age for people who really enjoy the craft of communications," says Steve Clayton, CCO of Cisco, who formerly worked at Microsoft and launched the company's print publication. When he first tried ChatGPT, Clayton says he worried his career was done. He's since become an AI optimist, seeing gen AI as a tool and opportunity for communicators and so-called storytellers to stand out with content that feels authentic content projects that strike people. "In an environment where nobody's sat at their desk today saying: God, I wish I had more email, or I wish I had more websites I could visit, or I wish I had more podcasts — the challenge is, how do you create something that is worthy of people's time and worthy of their attention?"

Jobs where brands build out their own newsrooms are "going to be one of the last places where AI is replacing writers," says Noah Greenberg, CEO of Stacker, a content distribution company. Unlike traditional media, which relies on clicks, advertising, and subscription to make money off a constant stream of content, "when brands are investing in the strategy, they're not thinking about: 'Do I break even on an individual piece of content?' They're thinking about: 'How do I create five or 10 really incredible stories every month that get our story out there, that prove and turn us into the authority as a respected party in this space?""

As with coding and image generation, LLMs are likely to keep getting better. LLMs may write with more voice or sound more human eventually. But the chatbots and agents don't think. They generate creative content without cycling through a creative process. A 2025 Columbia Business School study found LLMs have a bias for "Option A," preferring the first choice when given a list and asked to pick. For people working in comms, AI might be more friend than initially imagined foe — at least because it makes their work stand out.

This article answers some frequently asked questions about Recommended stories on the Firefox New Tab page on both computers and mobile devices.

Recommended stories on the Firefox New Tab page is a feature currently available in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, France, Spain, and India. We’re working to bring it to other countries.

Why am I seeing these stories, from these publishers, on the Firefox New Tab page?

Firefox’s recommendations elevate content that is worthy of your time and attention – that informs, inspires, entertains, and offers new and unique perspectives. Firefox’s recommendations team works with custom machine learning algorithms to surface the most compelling content from around the web, drawing on a wide array of sources with a track record of trustworthy and accurate coverage.

Are these stories on the New Tab page personalized to me?

For the most part, no. Most recommendations on your New Tab page come from a general list of the best stories on the web. But Firefox is actively working on ways to deliver personalized recommendations in a way that vigorously protects users’ privacy. Importantly, Mozilla never receives a copy of your browser history. When personalization does occur, recommendations rely on a process of story sorting and filtering that happens locally in your personal copy of Firefox.

What information is collected when I interact with Recommended stories?

By default, when stories recommended by Firefox are displayed on your New Tab page, we collect information about how many times they appear and how many times they are clicked. You can learn more about how to manage how your data is collected.

Firefox partners with select publishers and brands to deliver high-quality sponsored content and advertisements to our users. This content will always be clearly marked, and you have control over whether it is shown on your New Tab page.

If you prefer to not see a sponsored story on your New Tab page, you can easily dismiss it by selecting the three-dot button next to the recommendations and clicking Dismiss. You can also permanently opt-out of viewing sponsored stories by following the instructions here.

Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us. Except for an aggregated total count of impressions and clicks that a particular item receives, sponsors do not receive any additional data from Mozilla. We do not collect personally identifying data through these interactions, nor do we share it with our sponsors.

Many stories remain relevant beyond 24 hours. Firefox elevates content that’s interesting and relevant regardless of publication date.

I don’t want to see recommended stories on my New Tab page. How do I turn this off?

To hide recommended stories in Firefox on your computer or mobile device, follow these instructions:

If you don’t like a piece of content that was recommended, you can dismiss it from the menu that appears when you select the three-dot button at the top right corner of the tile.

Why does an article recommended to me have a paywall?

What is a paywall?

A paywall is a way to restrict access to certain online content. Some publishers use it to encourage readers to log in or subscribe to be able to view their articles.

Websites can implement two kinds of paywalls:

A soft paywall that lets readers view a limited number of articles before prompting them to log in or subscribe.

A hard paywall that blocks viewing any content without subscribing first.

Why might I see an article with a Paywall in Recommended stories?

From time to time, you may encounter a Recommended story that is from a site that utilizes paywalls. Our policy is to not recommend content that’s behind hard paywalls, but we will include recommendations from sites that use soft paywalls.

Our aim is to recommend the best of the web by connecting readers with stories that are worthy of their time and attention, and this policy means that we can connect these stories with the widest possible audience.

If you hit a paywall when trying to view a story, it’s likely you have already hit your maximum number of stories allotted by that publisher. At that point, you can choose to subscribe to the publisher if you’d like, or move on to the next article.

What if I want to opt out of data collection?

Firefox collects technical and usage data by default, but you can turn this off at any time.

In the Menu bar at the top of the screen, click Firefox and select Settings (or Preferences, in some cases).Click the menu button and select Settings.

Select the Privacy & Security panel.

Scroll down to the Firefox Data Collection and Use section.

        <hr/>
        We’ve all been there: It’s 6 a.m. and the very last thing you want to do is get out of bed for that way-too-early HIIT class you already paid for. Or, if you’re a remote worker like me, you know you really should go on that jog you planned your entire day around…but also, what if you just didn’t? So. Tempting.

It’s embarrassingly easy to put off that thing you know you should do—but why? As Janelle S. Peifer, PhD, a licensed clinical psychologist and assistant professor at the University of Richmond told me, we humans like short-cuts and habits that minimize the cognitive, physical, and emotional load we’re exposed to in our daily lives. In other words, we’re kinda lazy. Plus, certain activities can bring up uncertainty, stress, and even feel like threats to our self-esteem, she tells SELF.

I get it. The urge to bail can be intense—even if you know, deep-down, that said activity is good for you and may very well better your life. As Dr. Peifer told me, your brain likes to play games with you—but there are some powerful tricks you can use to outsmart that instinct to flake so you don’t wind up regretting ditching your plans. Here are a few to try.

Validate your feelings.

Step one: Acknowledge that the task you’re avoiding is challenging. Oftentimes, we tell ourselves we’re weak or flawed by not following through with something that’s relatively simple. “You might think, ‘Why can’t I do this, I said I was going to do it,’” says Dr. Peifer.

But negative emotions like punishment and guilt cause you to procrastinate and further reduce the chance you’ll follow through. For example, if every time you don’t go to the gym you beat yourself up about it, you’ll stop even trying to motivate yourself to do it. On the flip side, when you feel positive and capable about your to-dos, you’ll naturally feel less resistance and therefore be less likely to drag your feet.

So, normalize the struggle—recognize that the task, whether it be getting off your couch to meet up with friends or scheduling those doctor appointments you’re past due for, is going to take some work and effort. When you take this approach, you’ll feel less like a failure, which will reduce the chances you’ll give up, says Dr. Peifer.

Break down your task into tiny, achievable parts.

People often set intense, lofty goals that are inherently tough to achieve, says Dr. Peifer. Maybe you signed up for a gym membership and enrolled in fitness classes every single night of the week. Or, perhaps, you bought enough ingredients at the grocery store to meal prep five dinners in a row.

Going from zero to 100 is a fool’s errand, says Dr. Peifer, and you’re more likely to stick with your plans when you aim to accomplish small, attainable tasks. Maybe that means you only go to the gym two times a week or cook three nights and let yourself dine out or order in (or graze on whatever you have laying around) the other nights.

Then, when you actually have to walk out the door, focus on the steps you need to take—put on your sneakers, go outside, walk or drive to the grocery store—instead of the monumental cooking sesh you’re about to have, says Claudia Giolitti-Wright, MA, LMFT, the founder and clinical director of Psychotherapy for Young Women.

Humans are way more likely to complete realistic tasks than goals or activities that are much broader, harder, or complex, says Dr. Peifer. This is why I opt for 20-minute Peloton rides instead of 45- or 60-minute sessions on my busier (or lazier) days—they simply feel more attainable. And, guess what, I still feel fantastic after!

Again, this brings us back to that idea of positive reinforcement: If you feel proud or accomplished when you complete your plans, you’re more likely to follow through next time. “You’re getting intermittent reinforcements that are like gas in the tank,” Dr. Peifer says.

Focus on the process, not the outcomes.

It's easy to reduce a workout or other to-do to just that: a to-do that you need to check off so that you can say you got it done. But focusing on all of the tiny positive things you'll get out of the process can actually be more motivating. “Avoidance often gets worse when the goal is outcome-based,” says Giolitti-Wright.

So, rather than going into something focusing on what you need to do or what the end result will be, try to be present and focus on what you’ll get out of the journey. Take a Peloton ride, for example. Focusing on how you have to exert yourself for 45 minutes can make it feel daunting (and kind of like a chore), but when you think about what the ride will actually be like—bopping along to fun music, high-fiving random strangers on the leaderboard, laughing at whatever-the-hell Cody Rigsby says next—you’ll probably find your finger backing away from the cancel button.

Get an accountability buddy.

Another quick hack: Team up with a pal who can hold you accountable. “We often try to do things individualistically,” says Dr. Peifer, “but feeling committed to and supported by other people can be really helpful.”

Research shows teaming up with others boosts follow through. Essentially, whether you’re planning to work out, read, eat, whatever, you’ll feel happier and more motivated when you do it with a buddy. So, text a friend and ask them to give you a brief pep talk. Or invite them to that networking happy hour you’ve got penciled in (but are dreading). It’s far easier to commit when you’re in it together. And if it’s as bad as you feared it would be, you’ll at least have someone to commiserate with.

Allow yourself to take a raincheck.

Finally, and I am a huge advocate for this tip, know when it’s time to pivot. Sometimes that inner voice telling you to take it easy is onto something. Perhaps said activity is simply not a good fit for you—maybe you’re not feeling so jazzed about Pilates because you’re actually more of a long walk outdoors kinda person (me!). That’s important intel!

There’s also a chance you need to slow down. If you’re tired, hungry, sick, or in pain, listen to those cues—your body’s trying to tell you something. Reassess your goal and either give yourself permission to scale back to something that feels way more attainable (like we talked about above) or reschedule it for later in the week. Rest is also productive.

I’ll leave you with one final tip: If you wind up postponing, be nice to yourself. Tell yourself you’re maxed out and will reset and try again soon, or that you aren’t quitting, but rather, pacing yourself, says Giolitti-Wright. “If you bail, bail kindly, don’t turn it into a character attack,” she says.

        <hr/>
        The viral virtual assistant OpenClaw—formerly known as Moltbot, and before that Clawdbot—is a symbol of a broader revolution underway that could fundamentally alter how the internet functions. Instead of a place primarily inhabited by humans, the web may very soon be dominated by autonomous AI bots.

A new report measuring bot activity on the web, as well as related data shared with WIRED by the internet infrastructure company Akamai, shows that AI bots already account for a meaningful share of web traffic. The findings also shed light on an increasingly sophisticated arms race unfolding as bots deploy clever tactics to bypass website defenses meant to keep them out.

“The majority of the internet is going to be bot traffic in the future,” says Toshit Pangrahi, cofounder and CEO of TollBit, a company that tracks web-scraping activity and published the new report. “It’s not just a copyright problem, there is a new visitor emerging on the internet.”

Most big websites try to limit what content bots can scrape and feed to AI systems for training purposes. (WIRED’s parent company, Condé Nast, as well as other publishers, are currently suing several AI companies over alleged copyright infringement related to AI training.)

But another kind of AI-related website scraping is now on the rise as well. Many chatbots and other AI tools can now retrieve real-time information from the web and use it to augment and improve their outputs. This might include up-to-the-minute product prices, movie theater schedules, or summaries of the latest news.

According to the data from Akamai, training-related bot traffic has been rising steadily since last July. Meanwhile, global activity from bots fetching web content for AI agents is also on the upswing.

“AI is changing the web as we know it,” Robert Blumofe, Akamai’s chief technology officer, tells WIRED “The ensuing arms race will determine the future look, feel, and functionality of the web, as well as the basics of doing business.”

In the fourth quarter of 2025, TollBit estimates that an average of one out of every 50 visits to its customers’ websites was from an AI scraping bot. In the first three months of 2025, that figure was only one out of every 200. The company says that in the fourth quarter, more than 13 percent of bot requests were bypassing robots.txt, a file that some websites use to indicate which pages bots are supposed to avoid. TollBit says the share of AI bots disregarding robots.txt increased 400 percent from the second quarter to the fourth quarter of last year.

TollBit also reported a 336 percent increase in the number of websites making attempts to block AI bots over the past year. Pangrahi says that scraping techniques are getting more sophisticated as sites try to assert control over how bots access their content. Some bots disguise themselves by making their traffic appear like it’s coming from a normal web browser or send requests designed to mimic how humans normally interact with websites. TollBit's study notes that the behavior of some AI agents is now almost indistinguishable from human web traffic.

TollBit markets tools that website owners can use to charge AI scrapers for accessing their content. Other firms, including Cloudflare, offer similar tools. “Anyone who relies on human web traffic—starting with publishers, but basically everyone—is going to be impacted,” Pangrahi says. “There needs to be a faster way to have that machine-to-machine, programmatic exchange of value.”

WIRED attempted to contact 15 AI scraping companies cited in the TollBit report for comment. The majority did not respond or could not be reached. Several said that their AI systems aim to respect technical boundaries that websites put in place to limit scraping, but they noted such guardrails can often be complex and difficult to follow.

Or Lenchner, the CEO of Bright Data, one of the world’s largest web-scraping firms, says that his company’s bots do not collect nonpublic information. Bright Data was previously sued by Meta and X for allegedly improperly scraping content from their platforms. (Meta later dropped its suit, and a federal judge in California dismissed the case brought by X.)

Karolis Stasiulevičiu, a spokesperson for another cited company, ScrapingBee, told WIRED: “ScrapingBee operates on one of the internet’s core principles: that the open web is meant to be accessible. Public web pages are, by design, readable by both humans and machines.”

Oxylabs, another scraping firm, said in an unsigned statement that its bots don’t “access to content behind logins, paywalls, or authentication. We require customers to use our services only for accessing publicly available information, and we enforce compliance standards throughout our platform.”

Oxylabs added that there are many legitimate reasons for firms to scrape web content, including for cybersecurity purposes and to conduct investigative journalism. The company also says that the countermeasures some websites use do not discriminate between different use cases. “The reality is that many modern anti-bot systems don't distinguish well between malicious traffic and legitimate automated access,” Oxylabs says.

In addition to causing headaches for publishers, the web-scraping wars are creating new business opportunities. TollBit's report found more than 40 companies that are now marketing bots that can collect web content for AI training or other purposes. The rise of AI-powered search engines, as well as tools like OpenClaw, are likely helping drive up demand for these services.

Some firms promise to help companies surface content for AI agents rather than try to block them, a strategy known as generative engine optimization, or GEO. “We're essentially seeing the rise of a new marketing channel,” says Uri Gafni, chief business officer of Brandlight, a company that optimizes content so that it appears prominently in AI tools.

“This will only intensify in 2026, and we're going to see this rollout kind of as a full-on marketing channel, with search, ads, media, and commerce converging,” Gafni says.

        <hr/>
        In September 2025, Nvidia and OpenAI announced a letter of intent for Nvidia to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI’s AI infrastructure. At the time, the companies said they expected to finalize details “in the coming weeks.” Five months later, no deal has closed, Nvidia’s CEO now says the $100 billion figure was “never a commitment,” and Reuters reports that OpenAI has been quietly seeking alternatives to Nvidia chips since last year.

Reuters also wrote that OpenAI is unsatisfied with the speed of some Nvidia chips for inference tasks, citing eight sources familiar with the matter. Inference is the process by which a trained AI model generates responses to user queries. According to the report, the issue became apparent in OpenAI’s Codex, an AI code-generation tool. OpenAI staff reportedly attributed some of Codex’s performance limitations to Nvidia’s GPU-based hardware.

After the Reuters story published and Nvidia’s stock price took a dive, Nvidia and OpenAI have tried to smooth things over publicly. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X: “We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world. We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time. I don’t get where all this insanity is coming from.”

What happened to the $100 billion?

The September announcement described a wildly ambitious plan: 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI, requiring power output equal to roughly 10 nuclear reactors. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC at the time that the project would match Nvidia’s total GPU shipments for the year. “This is a giant project,” Huang said.

But the deal was always a letter of intent, not a binding contract. And in recent weeks, Huang has been walking back the number. On Saturday, he told reporters in Taiwan that the $100 billion was “never a commitment.” He said OpenAI had invited Nvidia to invest “up to” that amount and that Nvidia would “invest one step at a time.”

“We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI,” Huang said. “Sam is closing the round, and we will absolutely be involved. We will invest a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we’ve ever made.” But when asked if it would be $100 billion, Huang replied, “No, no, nothing like that.”

A Wall Street Journal report on Friday said Nvidia insiders had expressed doubts about the transaction and that Huang had privately criticized what he described as a lack of discipline in OpenAI’s business approach. The Journal also reported that Huang had expressed concern about the competition OpenAI faces from Google and Anthropic. Huang called those claims “nonsense.”

Nvidia shares fell about 1.1 percent on Monday following the reports. Sarah Kunst, managing director at Cleo Capital, told CNBC that the back-and-forth was unusual. “One of the things I did notice about Jensen Huang is that there wasn’t a strong ‘It will be $100 billion.’ It was, ‘It will be big. It will be our biggest investment ever.’ And so I do think there are some question marks there.”

In September, Bryn Talkington, managing partner at Requisite Capital Management, noted the circular nature of such investments to CNBC. “Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia,” Talkington said. “I feel like this is going to be very virtuous for Jensen.”

Tech critic Ed Zitron has been critical of Nvidia’s circular investments for some time, which touch dozens of tech companies, including major players and startups. They are also all Nvidia customers.

“NVIDIA seeds companies and gives them the guaranteed contracts necessary to raise debt to buy GPUs from NVIDIA,” Zitron wrote on Bluesky last September, “even though these companies are horribly unprofitable and will eventually die from a lack of any real demand.”

Chips from other places

Outside of sourcing GPUs from Nvidia, OpenAI has reportedly discussed working with startups Cerebras and Groq, both of which build chips designed to reduce inference latency. But in December, Nvidia struck a $20 billion licensing deal with Groq, which Reuters sources say ended OpenAI’s talks with Groq. Nvidia hired Groq’s founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, along with other senior leaders, as part of the arrangement.

In January, OpenAI announced a $10 billion deal with Cerebras instead, adding 750 megawatts of computing capacity for faster inference through 2028. Sachin Katti, who joined OpenAI from Intel in November to lead compute infrastructure, said the partnership adds “a dedicated low-latency inference solution” to OpenAI’s platform.

But OpenAI has clearly been hedging its bets. Beyond the Cerebras deal, the company struck an agreement with AMD in October for 6 gigawatts of GPUs and announced plans with Broadcom to develop a custom AI chip to wean itself off of Nvidia dependence. When those chips will be ready, however, is currently unknown.

        <hr/>
        MADRID (AP) — Spain plans to ban social media access for children under 16, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Tuesday, in a move designed to shield young people from the harms of online content.

Sánchez chided the world’s biggest tech companies in a speech at a Dubai summit, saying they allow illegal content such as child sex abuse and nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images to proliferate on their platforms. He said that governments also needed to “stop turning a blind eye.”

“Today, our children are exposed to a space they were never meant to navigate alone,” Sánchez said. “We will no longer accept that.”

Spain joins a growing number of countries, including Australia and France, which have taken or are considering measures to restrict minors’ access to social media.

In January, France approved a bill banning social media for children under 15, paving the way for the measure to take effect at the start of the next school year in September. The bill would also ban the use of mobile phones in high schools.

Australia has started implementing the world’s first social media ban for under-16s, after its government passed a measure that holds platforms including TikTok, Twitch, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for failing to prevent children from having accounts.

Denmark has introduced similar legislation to ban access to social media for users under 15, while the U.K. said last month it would consider banning young teenagers from social media, as it tightens laws designed to protect children from harmful content and excessive screen time.

Sánchez said that Spain would require social media companies to enforce the ban with age verification systems, “not just check boxes, but real barriers that work.”

Many social media apps require users to be at least 13, though enforcement varies. Users are often asked to declare their own age.

Spain’s ban will be added to an already existing measure centered on digital protections for minors that is being debated by parliament, a government spokesperson said. Sánchez said that could happen as early as next week.

It’s unclear if Sánchez’s left-wing coalition will get the approval needed in Parliament, where his government lacks a majority. A spokesperson for the far-right Vox party said the Sánchez government’s measure was aimed at “making sure that no one criticizes them,” while the main opposition party — the center-right Popular Party — said it had proposed similar restrictions last year, seemingly offering its support.

Social media companies Meta — which owns Facebook and Instagram — and X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

But Elon Musk, X’s billionaire owner and the world’s richest man, wrote that “Sánchez is the true fascist totalitarian,” in a post referencing the Spanish leader’s speech at the World Governments Summit in the United Arab Emirates.

In his address, Sánchez also said that Spain had joined five other European countries in what the Spanish leader dubbed a “coalition of the digitally willing” to coordinate the regulation of social media platforms at a multinational level.

Additionally, Spain would make it a criminal offense to manipulate algorithms to amplify illegal content and would hold tech executives liable for failing to take down criminal content from their platforms, he said.

“No more pretending that technology is neutral,” Sánchez said.

Both measures would require parliamentary approval to change Spanish law, a government spokesperson said.

        <hr/>
        A Taiwanese national who built a crypto-fueled dark web narcotics empire worth over $105 million while moonlighting as a cybercrime trainer for Caribbean police has been sentenced to three decades in federal prison.

Rui-Siang Lin received the 30-year sentence for operating Incognito Market under the pseudonym "Pharoah," overseeing a digital drug bazaar that sold more than one ton of narcotics, including fentanyl-laced pills, to over 400,000 buyers worldwide between October 2020 and March 2024, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.

U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon handed down the sentence following Lin's guilty plea to conspiracy to distribute narcotics, money laundering, and selling adulterated medication.

<span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display:inline-block;width:0px;overflow:hidden;line-height:0" class="mce_SELRES_start"> </span>

“Today’s sentence puts traffickers on notice: you cannot hide in the shadows of the Internet,” U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in the statement. “And our larger message is simple: the internet, ‘decentralization,’ ‘blockchain’—any technology—is not a license to operate a narcotics distribution business.”

Incognito Market worked as a crypto-enabled dark web platform accessible via Tor that enabled more than 1,800 vendors to carry out over 640,000 narcotics transactions, including cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, MDMA, and misbranded prescription drugs.

To enable anonymous crypto transactions, Incognito Market maintained its own internal "bank" where users deposited crypto into personal accounts.

After each transaction, crypto was transferred from the buyer's to the seller's account, minus the 5% commission that funded operations and generated over $6 million in profits for Lin.

While managing Incognito from St. Lucia, Lin conducted a four-day training session for local police on "Cybercrime and Cryptocurrency," later bragging about it on Facebook.

In January 2022, Lin introduced a policy explicitly allowing opiate sales on the platform, which led to fraudulent prescription drug listings, and a 27-year-old Arkansas resident later died after taking purported oxycodone purchased on Incognito Market that was laced with fentanyl.

Lin shuttered the platform in 2024 after stealing at least $1 million from users' deposits in the Incognito Bank.

He then attempted to extort vendors and buyers on the site while threatening to publish their transaction histories and crypto addresses unless they paid him.

Homeland Security Investigations arrested Lin at John F. Kennedy International Airport in May 2024, following a multi-agency investigation involving the FBI, DEA, FDA, and NYPD.

Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at TRM Labs, told Decrypt the sentence "reflects how courts now view large darkweb markets as core infrastructure of the illicit underbelly of the crypto ecosystem, not fringe platforms."

"While it falls short of the life-level outcomes in cases like Silk Road and AlphaBay, pardons aside, it still sends a clear message that running these platforms carries consequences comparable to major organized crime," Redbord added.

In addition to the 30-year prison term, Lin was sentenced to five years of supervised release and ordered to forfeit $105 million.

        Adobe plans to shut down Adobe Animate, a 2D animation software used to create vector-based animations for websites, games, and cartoons.

As of March 1, the company will stop accepting new sign-ups. Existing users can continue using the software beyond that date, but technical support will end on March 1, 2027. To avoid losing work, users must download files before that technical support ends.

Enterprise customers have an extended timeframe for downloads; they’ll be able to export their files through March 1, 2029. Adobe has begun notifying users about the changes via email.

"Animate has been a product that has existed for over 25 years and has served its purpose well for creating, nurturing, and developing the animation ecosystem," Adobe says on a support page. "As technologies evolve, new platforms and paradigms emerge that better serve the needs of the users."

Adobe recommends that customers with a Creative Cloud Pro plan use Adobe After Effects for complex keyframe animation or Adobe Express for simpler animation effects on photos, videos, text, and shapes.

Animate users, including creators behind animation series Chikn Nuggit, have expressed their displeasure on social media. “Adobe has been legendary at destroying great products,” writes one user. “This is legit gonna ruin my life,” writes another.

        <hr/>
        Samsung’s 2025 was filled with new foldables, an ultra-thin new form factor and the launch of Google's XR platform. After making some announcements at CES 2026, the company is expected to host its first Galaxy Unpacked of the year in February to introduce the Galaxy S26 lineup. Official invites have yet to be shared, but the date is widely expected to be near the end of the month, probably on February 25 But as usual, we know a lot about what’s expected when Samsung does hold its next event.

Whenever it does happen, Engadget will be covering Galaxy Unpacked live, and we'll most likely have hands-on coverage of Samsung's new smartphones soon after they're announced. While we wait for an official invite, here's everything we expect Samsung will introduce at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026.

What is Unpacked 2026 taking place?

But first, when is Unpacked going to happen? A recent image shared by leakster Evan Blass indicated Unpacked should be taking place on “February 25 2026.” Blass has a long history of credible leaks, which means this date is all but confirmed, and the main questions remaining would be — what time and in what timezone? We’re still waiting on Samsung for the official details, which should include answers to those questions.

Galaxy S26, S26+ and S26 Ultra

Samsung's restrained approach to updating its phones will likely continue with the Galaxy S26. Based on leaked images of the new lineup, the company is not expected to radically reinvent the look of the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ or Galaxy S26 Ultra, and instead will stick with a similar design to what it used on the Galaxy S25. The phones will have a flat front screen and frame, with rounded corners and cameras housed in a vertical pill-shaped plateau on the back. Unlike Apple's move from the iPhone 16 Pro to the iPhone 17 Pro, the biggest difference here will likely be internal components like the screens, chips and camera sensors Samsung uses.

Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip is expected to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site Yonhap News reports Samsung's relatively new Exynos 2600 chip could be used in some phones in the lineup depending on the region, a strategy Samsung has deployed in the past. Either way the new phones should be more performant than the previous generation, and in the case of the models with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, particularly good at on-device AI processing.

One notable difference between the Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S25 could be the phone's screen. The new phone will reportedly feature a 6.3-inch FHD+ display according to specs shared by leaker Ice Universe, which makes it ever so slightly larger than the 6.2-inch display used on the Galaxy S25. The S26 will also allegedly come with 12GB of RAM, either 256GB or 512GB of storage and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery. Samsung isn't changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it'll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.

The difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. According to Android Headlines, the new phone's cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish. Samsung may also switch back to using an aluminum frame on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, after using titanium frames on both the Galaxy S24 and S25 Ultras. Most importantly, to make the phone actually support Qi2 rather than only technically work with the standard when a case is attached, rumors suggest Samsung will remove the S Pen digitizer layer in the phone and adopt a new method for accepting stylus input. It's not clear what that new method will actually be, but it could let the Galaxy S26 Ultra more easily work with Qi2 accessories without losing its stylus.

Android Headlines also recently shared what appear to be full image renders of the S26 series, and they generally line up with what has already been rumored, leaked and reported so far. If these pictures are accurate, they give us a clearer look at the camera bump and two color variants of the S26 Ultra.

Fans of magnets may continue to be disappointed by Samsung if the latest rumors are accurate. Despite the launch of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard adding support for convenient magnetic alignment years ago, Samsung has yet to bring that feature to its phones. Though the S-series have the higher speed charging rates that the spec enables, Nieuwemobiel.nl is reporting that, due to images it received of cases with magnetic rings, the S26 series likely won’t have built-in magnets. Samsung has made these cases to add the magnetic capability to its S-series in the past, and the existence of the images of these accessories lends weight to the idea that the company will continue this approach.

Galaxy Buds 4

Samsung released the Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro in 2024, with a major redesign that brought them much more in line with Apple's AirPods. The Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro Samsung is rumored to be announcing soon won't necessarily change that, though they will feature a more compact case and less angular stems, according to leaked images from the Samsung Tips app.

Support for head gestures to accept and decline calls, a feature Apple includes on the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4, is also rumored to work on both versions of the new Galaxy Buds. SamMobile reports the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro may also ship with a new Ultra Wideband chip that will make them easier to find with Google's Find Hub network.

Galaxy Z Trifold

Samsung announced the Galaxy Z TriFold in late 2025 without firm details of when the new smartphone-that-folds-into-a-tablet would be available in North America. That info came on January 27, when the company announced the TriFold would be available in the US on January 30, for a whopping $2,900. Considering we’ve already seen the device in person at CES 2026 and people are most likely to have had a chance to look at, if not buy the foldable for themselves by the time Unpacked rolls around, we don’t expect Samsung to spend too much time dwelling on it, if at all.

Galaxy S26 Edge

When the Galaxy S25 Edge was announced in 2025, it seemed possible that Samsung could replace its "Plus" smartphone with a unique form factor, just like Apple has opted to do with the iPhone Air. There have been conflicting reports on the matter, but it seems like Samsung will not be doing that with the Galaxy S26 Edge.

Instead, the smartphone will reportedly remain another option, much like foldables are for customers not swayed by Samsung's traditional smartphones. The Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to feature a slightly different design than last year's model, according to Android Headlines, with a large rectangular camera plateau that's reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones, and the raised oval Apple used on the iPhone Air. Beyond that, the phone is also expected to be ever so slightly thinner at 5.5mm than the 5.8mm Galaxy S25 Edge.

Bixby and other AI features

Samsung already acts as a first place Google can show off new AI features for Android, but the company is reportedly exploring other AI partnerships, too. In June 2025, Bloomberg reported that Samsung was nearing a deal with Perplexity to integrate its AI-powered search engine across OneUI and its homegrown mobile browser. Perplexity already has a deal with Motorola on its Razr phones, so the only thing that would make a deal with Samsung unusual is the close relationship the company already has with Google.

The company also accidentally announced a new version of its Bixby AI assistant, which will likely also be integrated with Perplexity and could serve as an alternative to Google Gemini. Both a new Bixby and a deeper integration with Perplexity seem like natural new software features to show off at Galaxy Unpacked.

Update, January 27 2026, 11:55AM ET: This story has been updated to reflect the latest news around the Galaxy Z TriFold’s price and availability in the US.

Update, January 30 2026, 12:45PM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks on the possible dates for Unpacked 2026.

Update, February 02 2026, 11:30AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks with full image renders of the S26 trio of devices.

Update, February 03 2026, 11:00AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks about the possible lack of magnetic support on the S26 series.

        <hr/>
        With Xcode 26.3, Apple is adding support for agentic coding, allowing developers to use tools like Anthropic's Claude Agent and OpenAI's Codex right in Xcode for app creation.

Agentic coding will allow Xcode to complete more complex app development tasks autonomously. Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI models have been available for use in Xcode since Apple added intelligence features in Xcode 26, but until now, AI was limited and was not able to take action on its own. That will change with the option to use an AI coding assistant.

AI models can access more of Xcode's features to work toward a project goal, and Apple worked directly with Anthropic and OpenAI to configure their agents for use in Xcode. Agents can create new files, examine the structure of a project in Xcode, build a project directly and run tests, take image snapshots to double-check work, and access full Apple developer documentation that has been designed for AI agents.

Adding an agent to Xcode can be done with a single click in the Xcode settings, with agents able to be updated automatically as AI companies release updates. Developers will need to set up an Anthropic or OpenAI account to use those coding tools in Xcode, paying fees based on API usage.

Apple says that it aimed to ensure that Claude Agent and Codex run efficiently, with reduced token usage. It is simple to swap between agents in the same project, giving developers the flexibility to choose the agent best suited for a particular task.

While Apple worked with OpenAI and Anthropic for Xcode integration, the Xcode 26.3 features can be used with any agent or tool that uses the open standard Model Context Protocol. Apple is releasing documentation so that developers can configure and connect MCP agents to Xcode.

Using natural language commands, developers are able to instruct AI agents to complete a project, such as adding a new feature to an app. Xcode then works with the agent to break down the instructions into small tasks, and the agent is able to work on its own from there. Here's how the process works:

A developer asks an integrated agent to add a new feature to an app.

The agent looks at the current project to see how it's organized.

The agent checks all relevant documentation, looking at code snippets, code samples, and the latest APIs.

The agent begins working on the project, adding code as it goes.

The agent builds the project, then uses Xcode to verify its work.

If there are errors or warnings, the agent continues to work until all issues are addressed. It is able to access build logs and revise until a project is perfect.

The agent wraps up by providing a summary of everything that happened so developers have a clear view of the implementation.

In the sidebar of a project, developers can follow along with what the agent is doing using the transcript, and can click to see where code is added to keep track of what the agent is doing. At any point, developers can go back to before an agent or model made a modification, so there are options to undo unwanted results or try out multiple options for introducing a new feature.

Apple says that agentic coding will allow developers to simplify workflows, make changes quicker, and bring new ideas to life. Apple also sees it as a learning tool that provides developers with the opportunity to learn new ways to build something or to implement an API in an app.

"At Apple, our goal is to make tools that put industry-leading technologies directly in developers' hands so they can build the very best apps," said Susan Prescott, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. "Agentic coding supercharges productivity and creativity, streamlining the development workflow so developers can focus on innovation."

The release candidate of Xcode 26.3 is available for developers as of today, and a launch will likely follow in the next week or so.

        <hr/>
        This February, the Super Bowl turns 60.

Before Super Bowl LX gets underway at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., it’s worth reflecting on where the game has been and how it’s grown since the inaugural Super Bowl, then known as the AFL-NFL World Championship Game, took place at the LA Memorial Coliseum in January 1967.

Back then, Vince Lombardi and Hank Stram roamed the sidelines, a pair of future Hall of Fame coaches representing not only their own teams but also the leagues—the NFL and the AFL, respectively.

Today, the Super Bowl is an American holiday, consistently topping television ratings among all programs for the year. It has become more than a game, but a celebration of Americana, a date everyone circles on their calendar, whether it’s to watch football, commercials, the halftime show or simply to gather with friends.

But it wasn’t always that way. The game has grown slowly over the years, exploding into the showstopper it is now. And that’s due to great football, but more importantly, the moments impossible to forget for those who witnessed them.

To that point, Sports Illustrated put together a blue-ribbon panel to vote on the top 60 moments in Super Bowl history. In an effort to get a precise list, all panelists (listed below) selected from a list of more than 100 moments and ranked their personal choices from 1 to 60. Once all the lists were compiled, we had our master list, which you’ll see below.

And we start with the opening play of the only Super Bowl ever played outdoors in a cold-weather city.

60. Super Bowl XLVIII: The Seahawks score a safety on the opening play

The Broncos were favored by 2.5 points. They received the opening kickoff. Then, on the first play from scrimmage, Super Bowl XLVIII began to unfurl.

With Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning adjusting the call at the line, center Manuel Ramírez launched the snap over Manning’s head and into the end zone. Running back Knowshon Moreno fell on the ball and was touched down by Seahawks defensive end Cliff Avril, resulting in only one of nine safeties in Super Bowl history.

The moment was the start of a Seattle onslaught, as the Seahawks charged to a stunning 43–8 victory at MetLife Stadium.

59. Super Bowl LVI: Matthew Stafford makes the perfect throw to Cooper Kupp

For years, Matthew Stafford wasted away in Detroit, spending 12 seasons on a Lions team often out of the playoff race by Thanksgiving. In his first year with the Rams, though, Stafford had his chance to shine.

In the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium, Stafford and Los Angeles had the ball trailing 20–16 with 3:07 remaining, facing second-and-7 at the Bengals’ 46-yard line. Stafford then unleashed the throw that would define his career, launching a no-look strike to receiver Cooper Kupp down the seam for a 22-yard gain.

Ultimately, Stafford found Kupp in the end zone to cap the drive, giving the Rams a 23–20 lead which held up in the final moments.

58. Super Bowl XXXVII: The Buccaneers score three defensive TDs in rout of Raiders

Super Bowl XXXVII was a classic contrast. The Raiders with their top-ranked offense. The Buccaneers sporting their top-ranked defense.

On Super Sunday, it was Tampa Bay that emerged with the best unit on the field. Under former Raiders coach Jon Gruden, then in his first year with the Buccaneers, the NFC champions dismantled MVP quarterback Rich Gannon. Gannon threw five interceptions and was sacked five times, with three of his picks being returned for scores.

In the third quarter, corner Dwight Smith went 44 yards with a theft, putting Tampa Bay up 34–3. In the fourth, All-Pro linebacker Derrick Brooks did the exact same, before Smith added a second pick-six to end the scoring.

It was the first Super Bowl victory for the Buccaneers after coming into the league in 1976.

57. Super Bowl I: Opening kickoff

On Jan. 15, 1967, America changed. The Super Bowl was born in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

That day, the National Football League’s Packers were looking for their second consecutive world title, taking on the Chiefs of the upstart American Football League. Green Bay was, predictably, a heavy favorite under Hall of Fame coach Vince Lombardi, coming into the game laying 14 points.

On a sunshine-bleached 54-degree day, Chiefs kicker Fletcher Smith sent the opening kickoff spinning into the air, and it was returned for 20 yards by Packers corner Herb Adderley.

Green Bay proved itself the superior team, winning 35–10 behind Bart Starr, who threw for 250 yards and a pair of touchdowns.

56. Super Bowl XXXI: Brett Favre hits Andre Rison for TD, rips off helmet and celebrates

After 29 seasons of wandering in the abyss, the Packers finally reached the Super Bowl once again.

This time, they didn’t have Vince Lombardi standing on their sideline, but were chasing the trophy bearing his name. To win it, Green Bay needed to beat the Patriots and coach Bill Parcells at the Louisiana Superdome.

On the Packers’ first offensive drive of the evening, Green Bay faced second-and-9 at its own 46-yard line. MVP quarterback Brett Favre took a deep drop and launched a bomb for receiver Andre Rison, who secured the ball and raced 54 yards for a touchdown.

In celebration, Favre ripped off his helmet and smiled wide, running with his headgear raised over himself. It was a symbol of the night, as the Packers went on to a 35–21 victory.

55. Super Bowl XLI: Prince playing the halftime show in a downpour

Super Bowl XLI wasn’t a great game. The most memorable part of the outcome from a historical perspective was Peyton Manning finally winning it all, giving him security from being the best quarterback to never win a championship.

Arguably, the most entertaining part of the night was when the Colts and Bears were in the locker room, seeking refuge from the downpour that enveloped Miami Gardens. While the teams were inside, Prince came onto the halftime show stage and gave a stirring performance, including such hits as “Purple Rain” and “Let’s Go Crazy.”

While the show only lasted a few seconds more than 12 minutes, it remains one of the most iconic performances we’ve seen on the biggest stage North American sports has to offer.

54. Super Bowl XXX: Larry Brown grabs two INTs en route to MVP award

It was supposed to be a mismatch. The AFC’s Steelers taking on the NFC’s Cowboys, a team looking to win its third Super Bowl in four years.

Instead, the game turned out to be competitive. Pittsburgh hung around and trailed by three points with the ball midway through the fourth quarter. However, the game swung when Steelers quarterback Neil O’Donnell dropped back and threw directly to Cowboys corner Larry Brown, who intercepted the wayward pass and raced to the Pittsburgh 6-yard line. Two plays later, Dallas running back Emmitt Smith ran in for a touchdown to ice the contest.

For Brown, it was his second interception of the game, having snatched one earlier off O’Donnell in the third quarter. Brown’s performance earned him a five-year, $12.5 million deal from the Raiders that offseason, a massive sum in 1996.

53. Super Bowl XV: Rod Martin nabs three interceptions off Ron Jaworski

Coming into the 1980 season, the Raiders were expected to be an also-ran. Instead, Oakland entered the playoffs as a wild-card team, then beat the Oilers, Browns and Chargers before taking on the Eagles in New Orleans for the title.

While quarterback Jim Plunkett was terrific with 261 yards and three touchdown passes, it was Rod Martin who stole the show. Martin, an eventual All-Pro linebacker in his fourth year, intercepted Eagles quarterback Ron Jaworski three times to help Oakland earn a 27–10 upset victory.

In his 12-year career, Martin had 14 regular-season interceptions. But in Super Bowl XV, the fourth-year linebacker picked off Jaworski on the opening drive, and then again in the third and fourth quarters. To this day, Martin is the only player with three interceptions in a Super Bowl.

52. Super Bowl V: John Mackey catches tipped ball for 75-yard TD

In Super Bowl history, there has never been a more blunder-filled game than the fifth edition.

In January 1971, the Colts and Cowboys got together in a game marked by desperation. Baltimore was attempting to erase its stunning Super Bowl III loss, while Dallas was trying to shed the label of Next Year’s champion. The result was a game with 11 combined turnovers.

Yet the best and longest play of the day came in the second quarter. On third-and-10 from the Baltimore 25-yard line, Hall of Fame quarterback Johnny Unitas dropped back and threw up the seam, with the ball being deflected twice. It ended up in the hands of fellow Hall of Famer, tight end John Mackey, who raced 75 yards for a touchdown.

Ultimately, the Colts won 16–13 on a 32-yard Jim O’Brien field goal in the dying seconds.

51. Super Bowl LIV: Tyreek Hill and Patrick Mahomes hook up for Jet Chip Wasp

The Chiefs’ dynasty almost never was. In their first Super Bowl appearance of the Patrick Mahomes era, Kansas City trailed San Francisco 20–10 with less than eight minutes remaining and faced third-and-15.

Then, Mahomes took a 12-step drop and heaved the ball down the left side with Tyreek Hill settling underneath the pass for a 44-yard gain. Four plays later, Mahomes found Travis Kelce in the end zone, touching off a 21-point onslaught to win 31–20, beating the 49ers in the Super Bowl for the first of two times.

Mahomes’s throw to Hill became etched in Super Bowl lore by the play name of Jet Chip Wasp, something Mahomes asked offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy to call in the moment. Without it, Kansas City likely has more Super Bowl losses than wins.

50. Super Bowl XIII: Lynn Swann makes leaping catch for TD

The NFL in the 1970s was defined by the Cowboys and Steelers. The two teams combined to win six titles in the decade, while facing each other in a pair of Super Bowls.

While both matchups were filled with Hall of Famers on both sides of the ball, no player is more synonymous with Pittsburgh’s pair of triumphs over America’s Team than Lynn Swann.

In Super Bowl XIII, the Steelers held a 21–17 lead going into the fourth quarter before running back Franco Harris rumbled in for a 22-yard touchdown. After the following kickoff was fumbled away, the Steelers regained possession, and on the first play, threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to a soaring Swann, leaping over the Dallas secondary to essentially put the game away.

49. Super Bowl LII: Brandon Graham strips Tom Brady to seal the deal

Going into Super Bowl LII, the prevailing belief was that Tom Brady would outduel backup quarterback Nick Foles. On the surface, he did.

Brady put up an unfathomable stat line of 505 passing yards and three touchdowns, helping New England to 33 points. Yet it was the play Brady couldn’t make that ended up defining the end of the 2017 season.

Trailing 38–33 with 2:16 remaining, the Patriots had second-and-2 from the Patriots’ 33-yard line. Brady dropped back and was stripped by defensive end Brandon Graham, and the fumble was recovered by Derek Barnett.

From there, the Eagles added a 46-yard field goal with 1:10 remaining, icing the franchise’s first Super Bowl victory.

48. Super Bowl IV: 65 Toss Power Trap

The Chiefs were expected to be a speed bump. The Vikings, favored by 12 points, entered Tulane Stadium with a 12–2 record and a defense allowing 9.5 points per game.

Yet in Super Bowl IV, Kansas City dominated the Purple Gang. The Chiefs got out to an early 9–0 lead on the strength of three Jan Stenerud field goals before recovering a fumble on a kickoff return. On third down from the 5-yard line, Kansas City coach Hank Stram called 65 Toss Power Trap, a play designed for running back Mike Garrett to take an inside handoff and find space off the left side of the offensive line.

Upon the snap, Garrett ran behind the pulling block of right guard Mo Moorman, going in untouched for a touchdown and 16–0, second-quarter lead.

The Chiefs eventually won 23–7, giving the AFL its second consecutive Super Bowl title.

47. Super Bowl XVI: Dan Bunz makes huge stop on Niners’ goal-line stand

Very few Super Bowls have been as unique as the one produced by the 1981 season. Neither the 49ers nor Bengals had made the previous postseason, and neither was expected to make any significant headway in ’81.

Yet both ended up at the Pontiac Silverdome in January. In Super Bowl XVI, the Niners raced out to a 20–0 halftime lead before Cincinnati scored a third-quarter touchdown and then had a second-and-goal at the 1-yard line.

After a Pete Johnson run was stuffed, MVP quarterback Ken Anderson threw to Charles Alexander on a flare pass inside the 1-yard line. What appeared to be a sure-fire touchdown was thwarted by linebacker Dan Bunz, who made the tackle short of the end zone. On fourth down, San Francisco once again stuffed an inside Johnson run, helping the 49ers preserve a 26–20 victory and their first Super Bowl title.

46. Super Bowl XLVII: The lights go out in the Superdome

The Ravens were cruising to a blowout victory over the 49ers for their second Super Bowl win in franchise history. Then, the power went out in New Orleans.

Due to a massive power failure, the Mercedes-Benz Superdome went dark, causing a 34-minute delay during the third quarter while workers worked to fix the issue. The stoppage gave San Francisco time to calibrate a new game plan, helping the Niners get back into the game before ultimately falling short, 34–31.

While the outage ultimately didn’t shape the outcome of the game, it provided drama in a contest that was lacking any until the stadium went dark.

45. Super Bowl XXXI: Desmond Howard goes the distance on kick return

Howard’s career had been wholly underwhelming after winning the Heisman Trophy in 1991 with the Michigan Wolverines.

The fourth pick in 1992 to Washington, Howard became a bust in the nation’s capital before bouncing to the expansion Jaguars in ’95. But in ’96, Howard signed a one-year deal with the Packers and finally had his moment in the pros.

In Super Bowl XXXI, Green Bay led the Patriots 27–21 in the third quarter. New England kicked off to Howard, who promptly raced a Super Bowl-record 99 yards for the touchdown, making the game 35–21 and finishing off the scoring.

It was also the capstone for Howard’s special year as a returner, in which he scored five return touchdowns, including two in the playoffs.

44. Super Bowl XLIV: Tracy Porter’s pick-six wins it for Saints

Entering the Super Bowl as 4.5-point underdogs to the Colts, the Saints were fighting hard but trailing 17–16 to Indianapolis heading into the fourth quarter.

In the final 15 minutes, Drew Brees led the Saints on a 59-yard touchdown drive, capped off by Jeremy Shockey’s 2-yard scoring grab. Still, leading by seven points with less than four minutes remaining, Peyton Manning had Indianapolis at the New Orleans’ 31-yard line facing third-and-5.

Trying a quick throw to All-Pro receiver Reggie Wayne, Manning’s pass was jumped and picked off by corner Tracy Porter, who ran 74 yards to a championship-clinching score, giving the Saints their first and only title in franchise history.

43. Super Bowl XLI: Devin Hester starts the Super Bowl with a bang

Tony Dungy knew better. For the two weeks leading up to Super Bowl XLI, the coach of the favored Colts told the special teams to kick away from Devin Hester at all costs.

Then, the morning of the game, a sermon from the team pastor spoke of not living in your fears. Dungy heard the words and told his coordinator to kick to Hester. The Colts wouldn’t live in their fears. Then, kicker Adam Vinatieri sent the ball away amidst a sea of flashbulbs going off. And then Hester went the distance. A 92-yard kick return on the opening play.

Unfortunately for the Bears, Hester’s moment also convinced Dungy to stay away from the only returner ever enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Indianapolis ultimately rallied and won 29–17, giving the Colts their first title since relocating from Baltimore in 1984.

42. Super Bowl XI: Willie Brown returns INT for TD

For the better part of a decade, the Raiders were a great team that could never win a big game. In 1976, that finally changed.

Oakland has reached either the AFC title game or Super Bowl in seven of nine seasons before going 13–1 and rolling into Super Bowl XI for a date with the NFC’s Vikings. The game was never close, with the Raiders leading 16–0 at halftime. Trailing 26–7 in the fourth quarter, Minnesota quarterback Fran Tarkenton threw an out-breaking route to the right side.

Tarkenton’s pass was picked off by future Hall of Fame corner Willie Brown, who raced 75 yards for a touchdown. Brown’s play was immortalized by NFL Films, which for decades has used the close-up footage of Brown’s face as he ran stoically with the play of a lifetime.

41. Super Bowl XXII: Washington scores 35 points in second quarter

Super Bowl XXII is a historic day in sports history. For the first time in NFL history, a Black man was the starting quarterback in the Super Bowl, as Doug Williams led an underdog Washington squad against counterpart John Elway and the AFC’s Broncos.

Early on, it appeared Denver would avenge its Super Bowl defeat from the previous year. The Broncos took a 10–0 lead entering the second quarter, only to watch Washington put on a display still unmatched in Super Bowl history.

Williams threw four touchdown passes while Timmy Smith rushed for a 58-yard score as Washington put up 35 unanswered points in the quarter, en route to a 42–10 victory. All told, Williams won MVP honors with 340 yards and four touchdowns, while Smith ran for a Super Bowl record 204 yards.

40. Super Bowl X: Bradshaw to Swann gives Steelers consecutive titles

Lynn Swann never had 1,000 receiving yards in a season. He only played nine years and was just a three-time Pro Bowler. Yet Swann is one of the more revered receivers of all time, largely because of Super Bowl X.

On that Miami afternoon, Swann caught just four balls but made all of them count. The first two were acrobatic specials over corner Marc Washington. The fourth clinched a Super Bowl and consecutive titles for the Steelers.

In the fourth quarter, and nursing a 15–10 lead, Pittsburgh faced third-and-4 from its own 36 yard line with 3:31 remaining. Quarterback Terry Bradshaw dropped back and launched a bomb to Swann, who outraced Washington and caught the pass before sprinting into the end zone. Bradshaw was knocked out on the play by defensive lineman Larry Cole, but the pass was perfect, and the Steelers had their second title.

39. Super Bowl IV: Otis Taylor shakes loose to clinch another win for AFL

Kansas City wasn’t expected to compete with the Vikings in Super Bowl IV. By halftime, the narrative was far different with the Chiefs holding a 16–0 advantage.

After the break, Minnesota got on the board with a Dave Osborn touchdown run, but the Chiefs had the knockout blow coming. On the following drive, quarterback Len Dawson had Kansas City at the Minnesota 46-yard line with 1:50 remaining in the third quarter. He hit a simple comeback route, which star receiver Otis Taylor took the distance by way of a pair of broken tackles.

For the Chiefs, it meant a world championship, something which had eluded them in Super Bowl I. It was also the last meaningful moment of the American Football League, which ceased to exist at game’s end, with the two leagues merging for the 1970 season.

38. Super Bowl XXIV: Joe Montana throws five touchdown passes to beat Broncos

There have been few Super Bowl performances more overwhelming than Joe Montana’s showcase against the Broncos in Super Bowl XXIV.

With the 49ers looking to repeat as champions and cement themselves as a dynasty, Montana put on a clinic against Denver’s top-ranked defense. The future Hall of Fame quarterback threw for 297 yards and five touchdowns, with all the scoring strikes coming before the midway mark of the third quarter.

Montana spread the ball around, finding Jerry Rice for three touchdowns, and both wideout John Taylor and tight end Brent Jones for one apiece as well. The result was a 55–10 win, still the biggest margin of victory in a Super Bowl.

37. Super Bowl XX: Ditka and Ryan, who hated each other, were both carried off the field

There’s a strong argument that the greatest single-season team of all time is the 1985 Bears. The fact that they were so dominant despite their two main coaches despising each other makes their 15–1 record and romp through the playoffs even more impressive.

​Chicago lost just once before shutting out the Giants and Rams in the NFC playoffs. In Super Bowl XX, the Bears thrashed the wild-card Patriots, beating them 46–10 at the Louisiana Superdome.

At the game’s end, coach Mike Ditka was picked up and carried off the field. Surprisingly, defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan was also carried off, with his charges knowing it was his final game before taking over as head coach in Philadelphia. It’s the only time two coaches were carried off the field together.

36. Super Bowl XXVII: Leon Lett gets chased down by Don Beebe

Sometimes it is the heart of a man, not his stats, that measures a player’s value and enduring impact on the game.

This was certainly the case for Bills receiver Don Beebe in Super Bowl XXVII. Buffalo was aiming to win its first Super Bowl despite making its third consecutive appearance. Unfortunately for the Bills, the game got away due to nine turnovers, and the Cowboys ran up a 52–17 lead late in the fourth quarter.

With 4:56 remaining, Buffalo backup quarterback Frank Reich was stripped of the ball. Dallas defensive tackle Leon Lett picked up the loose football and ran goalward, celebrating a few yards early by lowering the ball Michael Irvin-style towards the turf. Unbeknownst to Lett was that Beebe, running full-speed behind him, had caught up and knocked the ball free inches before Lett crossed the goal line.

Buffalo lost by a whopping margin, but Beebe’s effort gave both him and the Bills some national respect.

35. Super Bowl LVIII: Chiefs win in overtime on TD pass to Mecole Hardman Jr.

The Chiefs became a dynasty in Super Bowl LVIII, doing so in the most dramatic fashion possible.

Kansas City only managed three first-half points but came alive in the second half, tying the 49ers at 19–19 going into overtime. San Francisco won the coin toss and surprisingly elected to receive, taking possession and scoring three points on a 27-yard field goal.

Down three and with the ball, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes engineered a 13-play, 75-yard drive culminating in a 3-yard touchdown pass in the final seconds of the extra session. The win gave Kansas City its third Super Bowl in five years.

34. Super Bowl XXXII: Terrell Davis overcomes migraine with 158 yards, 3 TDs

John Elway had three previous chances to win the Super Bowl and was blown out each time. Then, in his fourth appearance and Denver’s fifth, the Broncos finally broke through on the legs of a man who could barely see.

Suffering from a migraine headache and sustaining blurry vision as a result, Terrell Davis fought through the pain to rush for 157 yards and three touchdowns, while also serving as a decoy in a second-quarter touchdown run by Elway.

On a night where the Broncos were 11-point underdogs to the defending-champion Packers, it was Davis who helped lead Denver to its first Super Bowl win, emerging as 31–24 victors in San Diego.

33. Super Bowl LVII: On one ankle, Patrick Mahomes runs 26 yards to a title

The Chiefs getting to the Super Bowl appeared a formality. At 14–3 and the conference’s top seed, they rolled into the playoffs. Then something else rolled. Patrick Mahomes’s ankle.

Dealing with a high ankle sprain from the divisional round to the end of the Super Bowl, Mahomes put on a legendary performance against the Eagles. Facing a ferocious Philadelphia pass rush, which had 70 sacks that season, Mahomes wasn’t brought down once, and with the game tied 35–35 in the final moments, the future Hall of Famer had his moment.

Facing first-and-10 from the Kansas City 43-yard line with 2:55 left, Mahomes escaped the pocket and hobbled for 26 yards, dashing toward an eventual game-winning field goal by Harrison Butker. For the Chiefs, it was their second Super Bowl win in the current era and the first of back-to-back titles.

32. Super Bowl XIV: John Stallworth catches the game-winning deep ball

The Steelers weren’t supposed to struggle with the Rams. After all, Pittsburgh was a dynasty, winning three of the past five Super Bowls. Los Angeles was 9–7 and starting backup quarterback Vince Ferragamo.

Shockingly, the Rams led 19–17 at the Rose Bowl entering the fourth quarter. Then, with the Steelers facing third-and-8 from their own 27-yard line, quarterback Terry Bradshaw and receiver John Stallworth hooked up for the ultimate game-changer.

Bradshaw went long down the middle for Stallworth, who made a beautiful over-the-shoulder grab to beat corner Rod Perry for the eventual game-winning 73-yard touchdown. Two drives later, Stallworth once again beat Perry for 45 yards, all but sealing a 31–19 Steelers win.

31. Super Bowl XXXIV: Warner finds Bruce for a 73-yard TD in the final two minutes

In the ultimate storybook season, the Rams saw two eventual Hall of Famers author a storybook finish.

After taking a 16–0 lead over the Titans at the Georgia Dome, St. Louis watched as Tennessee tied the game. With the ball at their own 27-yard line and 2:12 remaining in regulation, the Rams called an all-go special with receiver Isaac Bruce streaking down the right side.

As quarterback Kurt Warner dropped to throw, he was hit upon release by defensive end Jevon Kearse. The ball was a bit short, but Bruce made the adjustment and raced past fallen corner Denard Walker for the go-ahead score. The Rams would famously hold on, with Mike Jones tackling Titans receiver Kevin Dyson at the 1-yard line as time ran out.

30. Super Bowl XXI: Phil Simms goes 22/25 in epic performance

The Giants were looking for their first championship since 1956. Thirty years later, quarterback Phil Simms made sure to deliver it.

Against the Broncos, Simms and the favored Giants fell behind 10–9 at halftime before rallying to win 39–20. The quarterback, once benched in 1983 for Scott Brunner, had his finest hour at the Rose Bowl, completing 22-of-25 passes for 268 yards and three touchdowns. Simms’s completion percentage of 88.0% remains a Super Bowl record.

​For the Giants, it was the first of four Super Bowl titles the franchise has won, including another in 1990, when Simms was sidelined by a foot injury.

29. Super Bowl LV: Tom Brady beats Patrick Mahomes for his seventh title

For two decades, the only questions surrounding the Patriots was whether coach Bill Belichick or quarterback Tom Brady was more responsible for their 20-year, two-dynasty run at the top of the NFL mountain.

That question was answered for many in Super Bowl LV, when the underdog Buccaneers took on Patrick Mahomes and the two-loss Chiefs, and thoroughly dominated in a 31–9 win. For Brady, it was his seventh ring while also becoming the second starting quarterback to ever win a Super Bowl with two different franchises.

Meanwhile, it also made the claim of Mahomes being better than Brady a tough one to make. While Mahomes and Brady split their head-to-head matchups at three apiece, Brady won both playoff contests, including Super Bowl LV and the 2018 AFC title game at Arrowhead Stadium.

28. Super Bowl LI: Julian Edelman makes the catch of a lifetime

The Patriots trailed 28–3, looking like a beaten club in Super Bowl LI against the Falcons. Then, New England began to rally, an all-time comeback symbolized by a miracle catch from receiver Julian Edelman.

Trailing 28–20 with under three minutes remaining, Brady threw deep down the middle on first-and-10 for Edelman, only to see the pass broken up. Incredibly, Edelman stuck with the ball, dove, and got his hands underneath it for a key 23-yard completion to the Falcons’ 41-yard line.

After tying the game four plays later, New England won the toss and then won its fifth title in the first overtime game in Super Bowl history on a 2-yard touchdown run from James White.

27. Super Bowl I: Max McGee’s one-handed TD catch

The first Super Bowl wasn’t a big deal nationally. In fact, despite the game being held under sunny skies at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum, only 61,946 attended, even though the stadium had a capacity of 94,000.

Most football fans and experts believed the NFL champion Packers would hammer the AFL representative Chiefs, and they were right: Green Bay won 35–10. Still, there were a few seminal moments during the game, including one of the Super Bowl’s greatest catches to this day.

Midway through the first quarter of a scoreless tie, Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr threw a pass to flanker Max McGee. The pass was well behind McGee, who reached back with his right hand, snagged the ball and raced 37 yards for the first score in Super Bowl history. It was the first of two scores for McGee, who had seven receptions for 138 yards.

26. Super Bowl XIII: Jackie Smith drop

Jackie Smith waited his entire life for this moment. After languishing on the Cardinals for 15 years, the Hall of Fame tight end finally reached the Super Bowl in his first season with the Cowboys.

In the third quarter, trailing 21–14, Dallas quarterback Roger Staubach spotted Smith alone in the middle of the end zone. Staubach delivered a strike … and Smith dropped the ball. The Cowboys then settled for a field goal before allowing the Steelers to score 14 consecutive points, losing 35–31 at the Orange Bowl.

For Smith, the moment not only defined the game but, cruelly, his career. The man caught 480 passes for 7,918 yards and 40 touchdowns during his NFL days, but a singular mistake became the moment for which so many remember him.

25. Super Bowl XX: William Perry scores in dominant Bears win

Walter Payton. Jim McMahon. Mike Ditka and Buddy Ryan. The Super Bowl Shuffle.

All of those men and musical tunes are emblematic of the 1985 Bears, but perhaps nothing warms the memory such as The Fridge. That season, Chicago had rookie defensive tackle William Perry, known by his appliance-motivated moniker due to weighing 335 pounds.

After scoring two touchdowns during the season, Perry was given the chance to carry the ball with the Bears leading the overwhelming Patriots 37–3 in Super Bowl XX. From the 1-yard line, Perry slammed into the New England end zone before authoring a thunderous spike, putting an exclamation point on Chicago’s only Super Bowl victory, coming 46–10 over the Patriots.

24. Super Bowl II: Vince Lombardi gets carried off in final win with Packers

There’s arguably never been a better tenure for a coach than the one Vince Lombardi enjoyed with the Packers.

Taking over Green Bay in 1959 after the Packers had a single win the year prior, Lombardi earned a winning record before earning a championship game appearance in ’60. The following two years saw the Packers win NFL titles before earning two more rings in ’65 and ’66, the latter coming in Super Bowl I.

In the 1967 season, Green Bay won just nine games but survived the NFL playoffs to reach Super Bowl II against the Raiders. That day, the Packers won 33–14 at the Orange Bowl before the team carried Lombardi off the field. It proved his final game with Green Bay as coach before returning to the sidelines with Washington in ’69, before dying of stomach cancer in September 1970.

23. Super Bowl XXV: The national anthem by Whitney Houston

Most Super Bowl moments happen on the field, deciding championships and legacies. But every once in a while, something attached to the game also leaves an indelible mark.

Such was Whitney Houston and her rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” leading up to Super Bowl XXV between the Bills and Giants at Tampa Stadium. As is true in so many cases, the context matters. Not only was Houston’s performance flawless, it also came on the heels of the United States entering the Persian Gulf War.

As Houston sang, fans and players alike shed tears as thousands in the crowd held up small American flags, handed out at the gates before the game. The result is one of the most patriotic moments in sports history, matched by the vocal greatness of Houston.

22. Super Bowl V: Jim O’Brien kicks game-winning FG at the gun

There’s never been an uglier Super Bowl than the fifth edition. How so? There were 11 turnovers between the Cowboys and Colts, with the game played in complete desperation.

Dallas entered the game known as Next Year’s Champions, having reached the NFL playoffs three of the past four seasons without getting to the Super Bowl. Meanwhile, Baltimore had lost to Joe Namath and the Jets in Super Bowl III despite being favored by 18 points.

On this day, the teams traded mistakes and ultimately wound up tied at 13–13 with under two minutes left. Then, the game’s final turnover came when Colts linebacker Mike Curtis intercepted Dallas quarterback Craig Morton, setting up kicker Jim O’Brien with a 32-yard field goal attempt for the win. O’Brien connected with five seconds remaining, giving Baltimore its only Super Bowl victory before the team relocated to Indianapolis in 1984.

21. Super Bowl VII: Garo Yepremian’s gaffe leads to Mike Bass touchdown

The Dolphins were about to have the best symmetry in NFL history. They were leading Washington 14–0, lining up for a Garo Yepremian 42-yard field goal. If Yepremian knocked the ball through, and Miami’s defense could hold in garbage time, the Dolphins would win 17–0 to cap off a 17–0 season.

Instead, chaos ensued. Yepremian’s kick was blocked at the line, only for the diminutive Cyprus native to recover. Then, Yepremian attempted to throw and battled the ball into the air, caught by corner Mike Bass, who raced 49 yards for Washington’s first score.

Luckily for the Dolphins, they warded off Washington’s last-ditch effort on its next and final drive, finishing off the only untied and unbeaten season in modern NFL history.

20. Super Bowl XLVI: Eli Manning finds Mario Manningham for the perfect deep ball

When one thinks of Eli Manning making an incredible throw in the Super Bowl, the mind immediately rushes to David Tyree and his helmet. But in reality, Manning has never made a better throw than the one he launched four years later, locating Mario Manningham for a 38-yard connection down the left sideline.

Trailing 17–15 with under four minutes remaining in regulation, the Giants faced first-and-10 from their own 12-yard line. On the drive’s first play, Manning found Manningham in the smallest of windows, fitting the ball between the cornerback, safety and the sideline.

After review, the play was upheld. Eight plays later, Ahmad Bradshaw backed into the end zone, giving New York a 21–17 lead, which it would hold onto for its fourth Super Bowl victory in franchise history.

19. Super Bowl XXIX: Steve Young breaks record with six TD passes

For years, Steve Young lived in Joe Montana’s shadow. Young took over for an injured Montana in 1991 and ’92, winning MVP honors in the latter season before doing it again in ’94. Still, two NFC championship game defeats to the Cowboys left 49ers fans down on Young, who, unlike Montana, hadn’t added to the Niners’ trophy case.

But in Super Bowl XXIX, all that changed. After defeating Dallas in the NFC title game, the 49ers entered as 19-point favorites over the Chargers. Young then had the day of days, throwing for 325 yards and six touchdowns in a 49–26 romp over the AFC champs.

Young’s effort earned him MVP honors, while his half-dozen scoring strikes remain a Super Bowl record.

18. Super Bowl XLIV: The Saints gamble and win with an onside kick

No team embodied losing more than the Saints for most of their history. Upon entering the NFL as an expansion team in 1967, New Orleans endured 20 consecutive losing seasons and didn’t win a playoff game until the 2000 campaign.

The Saints finally reached their first Super Bowl in 2009, playing the favored Colts in Miami. Trailing 10–6 at halftime, coach Sean Payton called for a surprise onside kick to start the third quarter.

As a result, New Orleans recovered and scored on a 16-yard Pierre Thomas reception, helping the Saints win 31–17 and earn their first, and only, Super Bowl victory.

17. Super Bowl XXXVI: Tom Brady authors his first big comeback

Facing the two-touchdown favorite Rams in the Louisiana Superdome, Tom Brady began his legacy as the greatest quarterback of all time.

While New England’s defense should get the majority of the credit for beating the Greatest Show on Turf, holding them to 17 points, Brady is the one forever remembered for engineering a game-winning drive in the dying seconds.

With 1:21 remaining in a 17–17 tie and New England taking over at its own 17-yard line, famed commentator and Hall of Fame coach John Madden believed the Patriots should play for overtime. Instead, Brady led the Patriots on a 53-yard drive on five completions before Adam Vinatieri began the dynasty with a 48-yard field goal as time expired.

16. Super Bowl VII: Dolphins finish off NFL’s only perfect season

There are 59 Super Bowl champions, but only one is perfect.

On Jan. 14, 1973, Miami met Washington at the LA Memorial Coliseum. The Dolphins entered the game 16–0, having navigated the playoffs with wins over the Browns and Steelers en route to the Super Bowl. Meanwhile, Washington had hammered the Packers and Cowboys, winning by a combined score of 42–6.

Going into the game, Miami was only a one-point favorite, with many believing the Dolphins had feasted on a soft, AFC-heavy schedule. However, Super Bowl VII proved no contest despite a 14–7 final score, with Miami outgaining Washington behind a rushing attack that notched 184 yards, led by Hall of Fame fullback Larry Csonka, who gained 112 yards.

The final play was Miami star defensive end Bill Stanfill sacking quarterback Billy Kilmer, giving the Dolphins their capstone.

15. Super Bowl XXXII: John Elway’s helicopter ride

For years, John Elway and Dan Marino looked to be destined for legendary careers without the ultimate achievement. Both members of the famed 1983 draft class, Elway had reached three Super Bowls to Marino’s lone appearance, but all four games resulted in blowouts.

In Elway’s 15th season, the Broncos made it back once more, this time as 11-point underdogs to the defending champion Packers. With the game in San Diego, Denver and Green Bay went back and forth throughout, leading to the most memorable moment of the evening.

Tied at 17 and facing third-and-6 at the Packers’ 12-yard line, the 37-year-old Elway scrambled right and dove head-first for a first down, clearing linebacker Brian Williams while being simultaneously hit by safety LeRoy Butler and defensive back Mike Pryor. Elway gained eight yards, and Denver scored the go-ahead touchdown two plays later before winning 31–24.

14. Super Bowl XVIII: Marcus Allen goes the distance on a 74-yard jaunt

The Raiders were the standard for much of the 1970s and ’80s alongside the Cowboys, Steelers and 49ers, winning three Super Bowls in eight years between 1976 to ’83.

However, entering Super Bowl XVIII in Tampa, Los Angeles was expected to struggle against Washington, a defending champion who beat the Raiders in the regular season. However, the underdogs destroyed Joe Gibbs’s team, winning 38–9 in one of the most lopsided Super Bowls of all time.

While much of the night was forgettable for anybody not a Silver & Black fan, the game did provide one of the greatest runs in NFL history. Leading 28–9 in the final minute of the third quarter, future Hall of Fame running back Marcus Allen took a handoff, went left, reversed course and galloped across the field, eventually scoring on a brilliant 74-yard carry, giving the Raiders a 35–9 advantage.

13. Super Bowl XXXIV: The Tackle

No Super Bowl has ever had a more dramatic ending in regulation. And few, if ever, entered with a better story.

For the Rams, it was a dream season. They went 13–3 and hosted the first NFL playoff game in St. Louis history behind MVP quarterback Kurt Warner, who threw 40 touchdowns after stocking Hy-Vee groceries only a few years earlier.

Against the Titans, St. Louis built a 16–0 lead before Tennessee tied the game. After a 73-yard touchdown strike to Isaac Bruce from Warner, the Rams led 23–16 with six seconds remaining, and the Titans were at the St. Louis 10-yard line.

On the play, Steve McNair completed a pass to Kevin Dyson, who was tackled by the legs at the 1-yard line by linebacker Mike Jones, preserving the Rams’ first Super Bowl title.

12. Super Bowl XVII: John Riggins breaks 43-yard run to sink Dolphins

In 1982, the NFL was upside down. The league had only a nine-game season due to the players’ strike, and as a result, the playoffs were scrapped in favor of the Super Bowl tournament, allowing 16 of 28 teams to make the postseason.

As a result, Washington and Miami showed up, two teams that had met in the Super Bowl a decade before. In this game, one-loss Washington fell behind multiple times in the first half before drawing to 17–13 in the fourth quarter, facing a fourth-and-1 from the Dolphins’ 43-yard line.

After riding fullback John Riggins and his 444 playoff rushing yards to the Super Bowl, coach Joe Gibbs called I-Left 70 Chip, designed for Riggins to crash through the left side. Riggins did exactly that, breaking a tackle from corner Don McNeal and racing into the end zone for the game-winning touchdown, giving Washington its first Super Bowl win, 27–17.

11. Super Bowl X: Lynn Swann makes two levitating leaps

Lynn Swann is in the Hall of Fame despite having 5,462 career receiving yards. That’s outside the top 250 all-time, behind players such as Cole Beasley, Jabar Gaffney, Jessie Hester and Bobby Joe Conrad.

Yet Swann deserves to be in Canton, solely on his Super Bowl exploits. Swann was at his best in Super Bowl X against the Cowboys, catching only four passes but making three of them all highlight-reel grabs.

While the last one was a 64-yard, championship-sealing touchdown catch, the first two were legendary in their own right. In the first quarter, quarterback Terry Bradshaw aired it out for Swann down the right sideline, with the receiver leaping over corner Mark Washington for a toe-tapping, 32-yard gain. A quarter later, Bradshaw found Swann down the middle for a leaping, juggling 53-yard reception, again beating the beleaguered Washington.

Pittsburgh won 21–17, with Swann totaling 161 yards and a touchdown in the victory.

10. Super Bowl XLIII: Santonio Holmes turns Pittsburgh into Sixburgh

This edition of the Super Bowl wasn’t expected to be a classic. The Steelers entered the game as 6.5-point favorites against the Cardinals, a team that had never played on Super Sunday and was 9–7 in the regular season.

Yet, as the game unfolded, it became one of the most iconic Super Bowls of the era. The Steelers never trailed until the final three minutes, after a 64-yard spectacular catch and run by Larry Fitzgerald, who caught a second-and-10 slant route, beating corner Ike Taylor and taking it the distance to give Arizona a 23–20 lead with 2:47 remaining in regulation.

Still, the Steelers had time. After eight plays, Pittsburgh had moved the ball 72 yards to the Cardinals’ 6-yard line with 48 seconds remaining. On the following snap, quarterback Ben Roethlisberger had ample time in the pocket, surveyed the field and finally fired in the back-right corner of the end zone.

Receiver Santonio Holmes began the play in the right slot and worked inside. Yet with everything covered, the third-year veteran worked back toward the pylon. Despite being smothered by three defensive backs, including Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, Ralph Brown and Aaron Francisco, Holmes located the ball, kept his toes inbounds and maintained control of the ball for a game-winning touchdown, giving Pittsburgh its sixth Super Bowl title.

9. Super Bowl XXII: Doug Williams becomes first Black QB in Super Bowl

The game was a laugher. Washington won 42–10 as 3.5-point underdogs, blowing out the Broncos in the Super Bowl for the second consecutive season.

Yet few games have ever been more important in the sport’s history, primarily because of what was accomplished and represented. In January 1988, the NFL had never had a Black quarterback start or win the Super Bowl. That changed in Super Bowl XXII, when Doug Williams led Washington into battle as the NFC’s champion.

After falling behind 10–0 at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, Williams and his team caught fire in record-setting fashion. Washington scored 35 points in the second quarter, including four touchdown passes by Williams. The onslaught led to a blowout by halftime, along with Williams being named the game’s MVP with a statline of 340 yards and four scores.

Since then, other Black quarterbacks have started and/or won the Super Bowl, including Patrick Mahomes, Jalen Hurts and Russell Wilson, but Williams was the man who broke down barriers and won it all.

8. Super Bowl XLIII: James Harrison goes 100 yards with an INT return

The greatest defensive play in Super Bowl history, according to our panel.

In Super Bowl XLIII, the Steelers raced to a 10–0 lead, threatening to blow out the underdog Cardinals. But Arizona rallied and closed to 10–7 with a first-and-goal at the Pittsburgh 2-yard line with 18 seconds remaining in the first half.

On the play, future Hall of Fame quarterback Kurt Warner had one problem. Arizona was without timeouts, almost guaranteeing a pass. Presnap, the Steelers showed an all-out blitz but ultimately brought five men, with the team’s leading sack artist, outside linebacker James Harrison, faking a rush before dropping into zone coverage. Warner never saw him, fielding the snap in shotgun formation and quickly firing inside to star receiver Anquan Boldin.

Harrison was in a perfect position and snagged the pass at the goal line before racing toward the right sideline, escorted by defensive end Brett Keisel and defensive back Deshea Townsend.

Harrison broke the tackles of Warner and tight end Leonard Pope at the Pittsburgh 40-yard line before avoiding running back Tim Hightower. Finally, Harrison exhaustingly crossed the opposite goal line while being tackled by wideout Larry Fitzgerald. The score is the longest in Super Bowl history and gave Pittsburgh a 17–7 halftime lead before winning 27–23 for the franchise’s second title in four years.

7. Super Bowl XXIII : Joe Montana to John Taylor wins it with 34 seconds left

Trailing 16–13, the 49ers found themselves on their own 8-yard line with 3:10 remaining in regulation. Despite moving the ball at will to the tune of 350 yards leading into the final drive, the offense had accounted for only one touchdown.

Then, in typical Joe Montana fashion, San Francisco began moving. With five short passes and two Roger Craig runs, the 49ers moved to Cincinnati’s 45-yard line, facing second-and-20. From there, Montana found legendary receiver Jerry Rice for 27 yards and a first down. Two plays later, San Francisco faced second-and-2 from the 10-yard line with 39 seconds remaining.

On the play, tight end Brent Jones was supposed to be on the left end of the offensive line. Not hearing the call, the second-year man stayed on the sideline. Receiver John Taylor, who was supposed to be aligned elsewhere, took Jones’s spot and ran a skinny post, beating corner Ray Horton for the eventual game-winning touchdown for San Francisco’s third title in eight years.

The play, ironically, was Taylor’s first catch of the evening, coming in the final game for Niners’ Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh.

6. Super Bowl XXV: Wide Right

Super Bowl XXV took place in Tampa, opening with a patriotic show in the wake of the start of the Gulf War. Thousands waved little American flags as Whitney Houston belted out the national anthem, a rendition so stirring that ESPN made a documentary about it.

That moment was buttressed by the game’s ending, with so many things happening within the near-60 game minutes in between. The Bills entered the contest as a 6.5-point favorite. Still, they couldn’t shake the pesky Giants, who, behind the power running of Ottis Anderson and the genius of defensive coordinator Bill Belichick, staked themselves to a 20–19 lead in the dying minutes.

Buffalo’s hurry-up offense drove into position for the game-winning field goal, setting up Scott Norwood with a 46-yard attempt as seven seconds showed on the clock. Instead of becoming the hero who brought the Bills their first Super Bowl title, Norwood’s kick sailed wide right, setting off a string of four consecutive Super Bowl losses for Buffalo. In contrast, the Giants danced off the field with their second championship in five campaigns.

5. Super Bowl LII: The Philly Special

The Eagles had Nick Foles. The Patriots had Tom Brady and were defending Super Bowl champions. Correctly, Philadelphia decided on a bit of trickery to level the playing field.

Leading 15–12 in the final minute of the first half, the Eagles faced fourth-and-goal at the Patriots’ 1-yard line. Instead of kicking a chip-shot field goal or running the ball, coach Doug Pederson called for running back Corey Clement to take a direct snap before pitching the ball to tight end Trey Burton, who, rolling right, threw a soft pass into the front right corner of the end zone, finding Foles for the touchdown.

Without question, the Philly Special, as it came to be known, is the most iconic trick play in Super Bowl history. It gave Philadelphia a 22–12 lead at halftime in a game the Eagles would eventually win, 41–33.

For the Eagles, it was their first Super Bowl win in franchise history, with Foles not only catching a touchdown but throwing for 373 yards and three others.

4. Super Bowl LI: The Patriots come back from down 28–3 and win in OT

With three minutes remaining in the third quarter of Super Bowl LI, the Falcons led the Patriots 28–3. It wasn’t just a blowout; it was a coronation for an Atlanta team looking to bring a city its first NFL title while also capping Matt Ryan’s MVP campaign.

Instead of a moment to savor, it quickly turned into a nightmare for the Falcons. The Patriots scored on four consecutive drives to end regulation, including three touchdowns and a field goal. Meanwhile, Atlanta fell apart with a turnover deep in its own territory while taking a crushing holding penalty on its penultimate regulation drive, taking the Falcons out of field goal range for what would have been a clinching attempt at 28–20.

The game then went to overtime, a Super Bowl first. There, the Patriots won the toss and moved down the field one more time, with Tom Brady completing five consecutive passes, helping New England set up with first-and-goal at the Atlanta 2-yard line.

From there, James White ran right and barreled over the goal line, giving the Patriots the most memorable comeback in NFL history, winning 34–28 to give Brady and the franchise their fifth championship.

3. Super Bowl III: Joe Namath jogs off the field with No. 1 finger in the air

No single game has ever mattered more in American sports. No player has mattered more to professional football than Joe Namath.

On Jan. 12, 1969, Namath and his American Football League Jets entered Super Bowl III as 18-point underdogs to the NFL’s Colts. After the Packers had easily dispatched the AFL-champion Chiefs and Raiders in the first two Super Bowls, it was all but assumed Baltimore would roll over New York.

Instead, one of sport’s greatest upsets was authored on an overcast afternoon in Miami. The Jets scored the game’s first 16 points and eventually won 16–7 on the backs of five takeaways, while Namath earned MVP honors with 206 passing yards.

At the game’s conclusion, Namath ran off the field amid a sea of reporters, teammates and photographers, raising his right index finger in the air to signify the championship. NFL Films captured the moment and became one of the most iconic images of America’s grandest stage, showcasing the exact frame when the Super Bowl became more than a footnote laced with curiosity.

2. Super Bowl XLII: The Helmet Catch

The Patriots were one defensive stop from immortality. Forget being a champion. New England was attempting to become only the second unbeaten, untied team in modern NFL history, trying to cap a perfect season.

In the way were the 10–6 Giants, a wild-card squad that had pushed the Patriots, but were trailing 14–10 in the final minutes. After narrowly converting a fourth-and-1 on a Brandon Jacobs run, New York faced third-and-5 from its own 44-yard line with 1:15 remaining.

Miraculously, quarterback Eli Manning escaped what appeared to be a sure sack before firing late and across the middle, the ultimate no-no. Yet little-used receiver David Tyree caught the ball and pinned it to his helmet, swinging both the pigskin and his hands inches above the ground while being hit by safety Rodney Harrison. The result was a 32-yard reception and one of the greatest plays in Super Bowl history.

Four snaps later, Manning found Plaxico Burress in the left corner of the end zone with 39 seconds remaining, giving the Giants a 17–14 lead, which they’d never relinquish. While Burress’s touchdown won the game, Tyree’s catch has become synonymous with both Super Bowl XLII and miracle finishes.

1. Super Bowl XLIX: Seattle decided to throw, and Malcolm Butler called game

The game was more than a decade ago. Still, if you talk to some Seahawks defenders, they remain stunned and furious over the call.

Trailing 28–24 after more than 59 minutes of a phenomenal game, the Seahawks drove to New England’s 1-yard line. With the clock ticking down, most expected Patriots coach Bill Belichick to call a timeout. Instead, Belichick held his ground while Seattle got to the line with Russell Wilson in shotgun and star running back Marshawn Lynch to his left.

Lynch, the most powerful back of his era, was universally believed to be getting the ball, as Seattle would pound the ball in with three downs at its disposal. Additionally, Lynch had run for four yards and had 102 on the night.

With 26 seconds remaining and a potential second consecutive title in the offing, Wilson took the snap and fired right, looking for Ricardo Lockette on a pick play. Instead, he found corner Malcolm Butler, who jumped the route and boxed Lockette out for the interception.

The stunning turn of events gave New England its first title in a decade, leaving both the Seahawks and the country in a state of disbelief.

        <hr/>
        Hours after the co-owner of a St. Paul toy store criticized the federal government’s immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities during a national television interview, workers there said a pair of federal agents suddenly showed up to announce an audit of employee records.

In another case, protesters observing Immigration and Customs Enforcement movement said officers called them by name, and even led them back to their own home. To the protesters, the incident felt like a bold attempt to silence dissent.

Since “Operation Metro Surge” began in early December, immigration authorities have arrested some 3,000 people in Minneapolis, St. Paul and surrounding areas. The enforcement blitz has drawn criticism, especially of federal agents from ICE and the Border Patrol violently reacting to protests, including the shooting deaths of U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti. But residents in the Twin Cities and other areas where ICE has been cracking down recently say that some of the retaliation they’ve faced has come without a finger being laid on them.

“We’re talking about subtle transactions of intimidation here,” said Kalfani Ture, a senior fellow at Yale’s Urban Ethnography Project and a former police officer. He said the shootings of Good and Pretti were dramatic shows of force. “Repression doesn’t always operate in the dramatic. It often operates in the mundane.”

In the case of Mischief Toys, ABC News reported that workers at the St. Paul toy store used a 3D printer to make thousands of free whistles for people to alert others of the presence of immigration agents. Co-owner Abigail Adelsheim-Marshall told ABC News that it was a form of nonviolent protest and that demand soared after Good was killed. “Everyone is looking for anything they can do to help their community right now,” she said, adding, “ICE is doing far more to hurt our community than immigrants ever have, and I can’t overstate how much our entire community is being terrorized by ICE right now.”

And then the federal agents came to the store. Department of Homeland Security officials confirmed that it had opened an investigation into the store.

“There is an active HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] investigation involving this business that has nothing to do with this owner’s political views,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Independent.

She went on to call the claims that the investigation was in retaliation for Adelsheim-Marshall’s comments “a flagrant attempt to further demonize our law enforcement officers who are already facing a more than 1,300% increase in assaults against them.”

Mike Cutler spent three decades at the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the predecessor to ICE and other Homeland Security units. Since he retired as a senior special agent, he has been a consultant on immigration enforcement and testified before Congress. Cutler said he doubted there was a retaliatory audit because it would diverge from how the agency operated in the past.

“It seems like a fantasy, because if I had engaged in that kind of activity, I would have been at risk of being suspended, or more likely, losing my job,” said Cutler. “We never, ever, ever even thought of doing something like that.”

In another incident in Minneapolis, hospital officials at Hennepin County Medical Center publicly criticized ICE agents for showing up at a patient’s bedside without a warrant. Two days later, on Jan. 8, federal agents sent hospital administrators a letter announcing a similar audit.

Since then, immigration officers have continued showing up at the hospital, causing some workers to fear that their presence could dissuade people from seeking care and spark a public health crisis.

Several other people who said they set out to observe ICE agents found themselves under surveillance instead.

In early January, the day before an ICE agent shot and killed Good, a St. Paul woman and her husband tried to follow a caravan of ICE officers to see where they were going. The couple told Minnesota Public Radio that ICE agents soon surrounded their vehicle. One of them came up to the car and greeted the woman by her name, suggesting they had used her license plate to identify her.

The couple said that when they continued trying to observe the caravan, it headed to the street where they live. The couple told the radio station that they believed federal agents obtained their address to dissuade them from continuing to observe.

“Following or observing or reporting on federal agencies or federal activities is not a criminal activity — it's protected First Amendment activity,” John Boehler, policy counsel with ACLU of Minnesota, told Minnesota Public Radio.

On Jan. 11 in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota, outside of St. Paul, a man and his wife stayed a few cars behind a car with Florida plates that they thought looked suspicious. When they pulled into the same parking lot as the car, they later told CBS News, two ICE agents got out, knocked on their window, and demanded they roll the window down or get out of their car. When the couple said they refused and threatened to call local police, the agents got back in their car, but then followed the couple.

All another woman had to do was drive past an ICE vehicle for immigration agents to pull her over. They demanded she present immigration paperwork and knocked her phone out of her hand when she tried to record them, Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley told Minnesota’s Sahan Journal.

It turned out the woman didn’t have any immigration paperwork because she is a U.S. citizen. The woman, who Bruley described as a woman of color, was also an off-duty Brooklyn Park police officer, who Bruley said felt forced to disclose that she was an officer after the agents drew their guns on her. A Homeland Security spokesperson told the Sahan Journal in an email that the agency had no record of federal agents having pulled over a police officer.

In response to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Minnesota and others, a U.S. District Court judge ordered federal agents to stop arresting, retaliating against, pepper-spraying and detaining people “engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity.” The judge noted that a variety of federal government conduct during the surge would “chill a person of ordinary firmness from engaging in further protected activity. That conduct includes the drawing and pointing of weapons; the use of pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions; actual and threatened arrest and detainment of protesters and observers; and other intimidation tactics.” In one incident from early December, lead plaintiff Susan Tincher — a U.S. citizen who has lived in Minneapolis for 30 years — claims that agents cut off her wedding ring while shackling her and then held her for hours in a cell before releasing her without charges.

In a Jan. 27 statement from the Department of Homeland Security, the agency said it was in Minneapolis “to protect Minnesotans from criminal illegal aliens and get these criminals out of their neighborhoods.”

“Instead of thanking our law enforcement, sanctuary politicians have repeatedly villainized and dehumanized our law enforcement — even comparing them to the Nazi Gestapo,” the statement said. ”Despite these smears, our law enforcement continue to risk their lives in the face of unprecedented violence and threats against them to get criminal illegal aliens off the streets.”

Reports have surfaced of similar tactics by immigration officers elsewhere.

In the days after Pretti’s killing, a pair of protesters in Maine told The Atlantic that ICE agents showed up at their home after they had attended a protest. “This is a warning,” they said the agents told them. “We know where you live.”

Nicholas Natividad, a New Mexico State University professor in Las Cruces who studies human rights on the southern border, said if U.S. citizens are experiencing this kind of behavior, he couldn’t imagine what migrants are going through in detention facilities outside the public eye.

“This moment doesn’t reveal isolated abuses,” said Natividad. “It reveals a larger structure that produces dehumanizing outcomes through policy, bureaucracy and force, whether at the border or increasingly inland.”

Leonardo Martinez is an organizer with VC Defensa, an immigrant rights advocacy group of volunteers that’s been tracking federal immigration enforcement activity over the past year in Ventura County, California. He said non-lethal incidents of “aggressive arrogance” by immigration officers are routine and, increasingly, personal.

Martinez said VC Defensa members closely follow ICE agents and loudly alert residents of their presence, which they believe is a freedom that’s constitutionally protected. In response, he said, ICE agents have pointed large guns at observers, broken windows, sprayed bear spray into the vents of their cars, and threatened to come after their relatives, whom they call by name.

Martinez, 42, said agents haven’t yet shown up at his home.

“That doesn’t mean they won’t in the future,” he said. “They know where everybody lives.”

        <hr/>
        A childhood classic is set to disappear from the freezer aisle. The Coca-Cola Company, which owns Minute Maid, has announced its canned juice concentrates will be discontinued in the United States and Canada. I'll admit, I'm part of the problem: I've bought Minute Maid's frozen canned juice exactly once in my adult life. Still, it hurts to see the iconic juices go.

Like many Americans, I grew up on canned juice concentrate. As a young kid, I regularly watched my mom empty a frozen can into a plastic pitcher and add water. Sometimes, I'd help her mix the juice. There was a certain satisfaction in breaking the frozen concentrate apart with a spoon.

A Coca-Cola spokesperson told influencer and snack food savant @markie_devo that all five flavors — orange juice, lemonade, limeade, pink lemonade, and raspberry lemonade — will be gone for good by April. Fans of the sugary slush may still be able to find cans while store inventory lasts.

Fans turned to the comments to reminisce about the juices. For many, they were a childhood classic: "Noooooo," one commenter wrote. "The strawberry lemonade one was the best thing as a kid." "An end of an era is right!" wrote another. "My favorites growing up." Other commenters found new uses for the concentrates as adults. "Not the limeade! I use that for margaritas," read one comment.

Frozen orange juice concentrate started as a World War II-era project from the National Research Corporation. The military supplied troops with lemon crystals for vitamin C, but soldiers would often skip the foul-tasting crystals. Researchers wanted to create an orange juice alternative, but by the time they developed a powdered orange juice concentrate the war was over.

Researchers kept refining the product, and frozen orange juice concentrate hit the market in 1946. The concentrate launched the Minute Maid brand which quickly became a hit among American families. Ads stressed the ease of preparation and the rich, concentrated orange flavor. Plus, the frozen cans lasted longer than fresh orange juice.

In 1960, Coca-Cola acquired the brand. It remained a breakfast table staple throughout the mid-20th century and experienced a revival in the '90s. Fans developed their own ways to enjoy the frozen juices, too. Some reduced the water for a stronger taste, while others ate the frozen slush straight from the can. American tastes have shifted toward fresh juice, though. Going forward, Coca-Cola plans to focus on ready-to-drink beverages.

Still, the classic cans won't be forgotten. In 2012, the National Museum of American History added a Minute Maid concentrated orange juice can to its collection. At least future generations will be able to study the juice as a part of history — even if they can't taste the sweet orange slush for themselves.

        <hr/>
        Could humanity nuke an incoming asteroid to deflect it and save the Earth, disaster-movie style? A unique new impact simulation suggests that a nuclear option could be a viable last resort to avert an apocalypse.

Researchers have recently found that space rocks can withstand much more stress than previously inferred from experiments and observations. Counter-intuitively, asteroids actually grow stronger when subjected to an intense impact.

It may sound discouraging, but this discovery can improve planetary defense strategies because it suggests that a nuked asteroid will remain intact, rather than fragmenting into many space rocks that would rain down across our planet.

As detailed in a recently released paper, a team of researchers, including physicists from the University of Oxford, partnered with the Outer Solar System Company (OuSoCo), a nuclear deflection startup, to analyze what happens to an iron space rock under different levels of stress.

"These analyses are intended to examine changes in the meteorite's internal structure caused by the irradiation and to confirm, at a microscopic level, the increase in material strength by a factor of 2.5 indicated by the experimental results," explains Melanie Bochmann, co-founder of OuSoCo and co-leader of the research team.

Like the DART mission displayed in 2022, one promising way to avert an asteroid-induced apocalypse is to deflect the incoming threat with a kinetic impactor, a human-made cosmic battering ram sent to smash into a looming asteroid at many times the speed of a bullet.

It's conceptually simple, but the reality is fraught with perilous uncertainties; a hit in the wrong spot may only delay an asteroid's doomsday approach toward Earth. Furthermore, the impactor's energy and the asteroid's material response can lead to unexpected consequences like fragmentation or a surprising shift in momentum.

So, to decide between an impactor like DART or an as-yet untried nuclear approach, planetary defenders must ascertain the mechanical behavior of different asteroid materials. This knowledge is essential to transfer energy to said asteroid and redirect its trajectory away from Earth.

Yet such data is scarce, especially data that shows how materials react in real-time. For example, different models yield different values for yield strength, a measure of how easily a body breaks under stress.

These models may differ by up to a factor of seven, depending on whether they test for local (microscopic) or bulk (macroscopic). Additionally, the destructive nature of previous tests precluded direct measurement of material responses as they occurred.

"This is the first time we have been able to observe – non-destructively and in real time – how an actual meteorite sample deforms, strengthens and adapts under extreme conditions," says Gianluca Gregori, a physicist at the University of Oxford and one of the study's co-authors.

Researchers employed a unique technique to ensure they didn't destroy the evidence. They used the Super Proton Synchrotron particle accelerator at CERN's High Radiation to Materials (HiRadMat) facility to irradiate a sample from a Campo del Cielo iron meteorite, blasting it with high-energy, short-duration proton beam pulses at lower and higher intensities.

As a result, temperature sensors and laser Doppler vibrometry (a technique to analyze surface vibrations) revealed that the meteorite sample softened, flexed, then surprisingly re-strengthened. It also displayed a quality called strain-rate dependent damping, which means that the harder it's hit, the more effectively it dissipates energy.

This study method provides invaluable data that explain why discrepancies in yield strength observed in previous laboratory experiments differ from evidence of meteor fragmentation in Earth's atmosphere, and that these discrepancies are due to factors such as internal stress redistribution.

It also highlights that these mechanical properties evolve in real time and should not be assumed to be fixed, as may often be the case in existing asteroid deflection models. Further research will involve other types of asteroid compositions.

Here, researchers chose an iron-rich sample for its relative homogeneity, but more heterogeneous space rocks will exhibit different stress-dissipation capabilities based on the spatial distribution of their constituent materials.

The ultimate scope of this research will hopefully remain theoretical:

"The world must be able to execute a nuclear deflection mission with high confidence, yet cannot conduct a real-world test in advance. This places extraordinary demands on material and physics data," says Karl-Georg Schlesinger, co-founder of OuSoCo and co-leader of the research team.

However, should a nuclear option ever be necessary, it likely won't mirror the movies – no drilling necessary. Instead of loading an asteroid with explosives, some physicists propose a standoff nuclear detonation near an asteroid to vaporize part of its bulk and deflect its orbital path.

        <hr/>
        Around 2,900 top athletes from around the world will converge on Italy to take part in the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics, hoping to bring home medals across 116 events.

Olympians from Team USA have won a total of 330 Winter Olympic medals through Beijing 2022 — second only to winter sports powerhouse Norway. This year, Team USA is expected to bring around 230 athletes to the Winter Olympics, which run from Feb. 6 to Feb. 22.

These are some of the American athletes to watch.

Alex Ferreira

This will be freestyle skier Alex Ferreira's third trip to the Olympics. Ferreira took home silver at PyeongChang in 2018 and a bronze medal in Beijing in 2022.

"It's awesome representing Team USA, because I look at us and I think we're the best team in the world, and then it's special," Ferreira recently told CBS News. "It's a big deal to Team USA, to bring home a medal for America and for your town, for your state, for your country. It's huge."

If he couldn't compete in his Olympic sport, Ferreira said he'd compete in either track and field or trampoline.

The 31-year-old athlete, who started skiing at age 3 and began competing at 10, specializes in the halfpipe. His first competition was an aerials event, which his mother enrolled him in without informing him, according to Team USA. He's also medaled at the Winter X Games. During the 2023-2024 season, Ferreira swept five world cups, X Games Aspen and the Dew Tour. Ferreira also skis under his alter ego, an older man who goes by the name Hotdog Hans.

Alex Hall

Milano Cortina will be 27-year-old freestyle skier Alex Hall's third trip to the Olympics. He made his debut at the PyeongChang Games in 2018. Hall said he has more confidence now and a different outlook than he did then.

"Going to enjoy some of the smaller things at the Olympics, not necessarily the grandiose things," Hall told CBS News.

He won gold in slopestyle in Beijing in 2022, and earned gold in four different disciplines at the X Games: big air, slopestyle, knuckle huck and real ski.

Hall, who was born in Alaska to an Italian mom, spent more than half of his life in Europe. He grew up just a few hours away from where he'll be competing.

The skier said he's looking forward to meeting with athletes from around the world and hearing their stories, something which should be easy for him since he speaks several languages, including English, French, Italian and German.

Alysa Liu

Figure skater Alysa Liu, now 20 years old and back from a surprise retirement from the ice at 16, will be headed to the Olympics for her second time this year. She was the youngest U.S. figure skating national champion in history, winning the title at age 13. She won another national title at 14 before taking a break from skating after the 2022 Olympics.

After her comeback to skating, Liu won the women's singles world title at the 2025 World Championships. Olympic men's skating gold medalist Brian Boitano called it "the biggest comeback in sports history."

Liu recently told "60 Minutes" that as she prepares for the Olympics, she views herself as more of an artist than an athlete.

"I view competitions more as, like, a stage for performing," she said.

Amber Glenn

Figure skater Amber Glenn, 26, is headed to her first Olympics, just weeks after winning her third straight U.S. title. She's the first woman to do so since Michelle Kwan.

Glenn told CBS News that being an Olympian is "an incredible opportunity" because she'd "get to be on the biggest stage an athlete can be on, and I'd be able to voice my beliefs and my opinions and my message."

The skater has spent years advocating for mental health awareness and the LGBTQ+ community; Glenn came out as bisexual and pansexual in 2019.

"When I came out initially, I was terrified. I was scared it would affect my scores or something, but I didn't care," she said in a Team USA post from 2024. "It was worth it to see the amount of young people who felt more comfortable in their environments at the rink, who feel, 'Oh, I'm represented by her, and she's one of the top skaters.'"

Brittany Bowe

This will be Florida speedskater Brittany Bowe's fourth trip to the Olympics. The 37-year-old two-time Olympic bronze medalist specializes in long track. She said her earlier experiences in the Olympics have taught her to focus on the process.

"In years past, it's been really easy to be outcome-oriented, and I have found that that doesn't work. That can be become really debilitating in your preparation," Bowe told CBS News. "The cards will fall as they will, and for me to just stay focused in the moment, in the process and be ready to go when that gun goes off."

Bowe carried the American flag during the opening ceremony of the 2022 Olympics in Beijing.

"Being an Olympian is so important to me because it has given me the platform to inspire people, to encourage people, and it's also given me an opportunity to live out my childhood dream," Bowe said. "It's given me an opportunity to bring a whole squad of people along, and being able to take my family all around the world, for them to be a part of it has been really, really meaningful."

Caroline Harvey

As a 3-year-old newbie to ice hockey, Caroline Harvey told her aunt she'd make the 2022 U.S. Olympic team, according to Team USA. Her childhood prediction came true when she became the youngest member of the team and helped the U.S. earn a silver medal in Beijing.

"Anytime you get to wear that crest and represent your country, it's the biggest honor, and being able to do it at an Olympic setting is just something that is unforgettable," Harvey told CBS News.

The 23-year-old athlete was named the best defender at the 2024 and 2025 IIHF Women's World Championships. She's also a two-time NCAA champion for the Wisconsin Badgers.

She's hoping to take home gold in Milano Cortina, but said success is ultimately "knowing we did everything we could to be successful in playing our team game."

Corinne Stoddard

Milano Cortina will be 24-year-old skater Corinne Stoddard's second trip to the Olympics.

She went to Beijing in 2022, where she broke her nose during her very first race, according to Team USA. Stoddard competed in the rest of her races while unable to breathe out of one nostril.

Stoddard started roller skating in kindergarten, then switched to inline skating a year later. When she was 11, she began speed skating. While Stoddard does not yet have any Olympic medals, she's a three-time world medalist in short track speedskating.

The skater said she's dreamed of the Olympics since she was a child, which required a lot of hard work along the way.

"I would always have training every day after school, so there wasn't much time for like, play dates or sleepovers growing up," she told CBS News. "There wasn't much time as, like, a teenager, to go out with friends on the weekends. And then for my last two years of high school, I did online when I moved out to Salt Lake to start training with the national team, so I didn't get to do any of, like the typical like, prom and stuff like that. But to me, that's all worth it."

Deedra Irwin

Deedra Irwin grew up wanting to be an Olympian, but she was thinking about the Summer Olympics, not the Winter Olympics.

"I wanted to be an Olympic track star. I had no idea the Winter Olympics were a thing," Irwin told CBS News.

The 33-year-old athlete picked up skiing in high school as a way to stay in shape between the fall cross-country season and the spring track and field season, according to Team USA. It wasn't until she was 25 that she started participating in biathlon.

She went to the 2022 Beijing Olympics, where she finished 7th, the best finish ever for an American in an individual biathlon event at the Olympics.

"We've trained so much throughout our lives to just get to this stage," Irwin said. "And so I think for me, it means a lot of, like, community and family and friends. I don't remember the last time I was home for Christmas in the past, like, eight years."

Erin Jackson

Gold medalist speedskater Erin Jackson, 33, will be making her third Olympic appearance — and this year, along with bobsledder Frank Del Duca, she'll lead Team USA as a flagbearer during the opening ceremony.

In 2022, Jackson became the first Black woman to win gold in an individual event at the Winter Olympics — after nearly failing to make the team that year.

Jackson slipped at the U.S. trials. Teammate Bowe, who qualified for the 500, 1,000 and 1,5000-meter races at trials, gave up her spot in the 500-meter race to ensure Jackson would get to skate in Beijing.

"Each of my Olympic appearances have been super different, just like coming in at all different stages of my career, and this one coming in as the reigning champion, there's going to be a lot of pressure, but that's what I'm looking forward to," Jackson told CBS News.

Jackson first started ice skating shortly before her first trip to the Olympics. She first stepped onto an ice rink in 2016. Jackson spent years inline skating before that.

"I'm just super grateful to be able to skate in circles for a living, and I just want to keep doing it as long as I can," she said.

Hilary Knight

Ice hockey player Hilary Knight, 36, has been to the Olympics four times and has medaled each time, taking home a gold and three silver medals. Milano Cortino will be her fifth Olympics.

"And never would I have imagined being able to compete in five Olympic Games," she told CBS News. "I mean, that's just, that's crazy in the best way."

Ice hockey play has become a lot faster over the years, Knight said.

"It's a lot more technical, tactical. There's more of a dynamic, skillful level to it as well, and the visibility is ever growing, which is really exciting," she said.

Knight played a key role in creating the Professional Women's Hockey League.

Ilia Malinin

Figure skater Ilia Malinin is headed to his first Olympics. The 21-year-old, known as the "Quad God," is the first athlete to successfully land each of the six types of quadruple jumps in one program.

According to Team USA, Malinin eats a chocolate bar before each competition.

Malinan, whose parents were Olympic figure skaters for Uzbekistan and whose grandfather was a figure skater for the USSR, started skating at 6.

He won gold at both the 2024 and 2025 ISU Figure Skating World Championships.

Read Malinan's interview with "CBS Sunday Morning" here.

Jaelin Kauf

This will be freestyle skier Jaelin Kauf's third trip to the Olympics. The 29-year-old silver medalist specializes in moguls and dual moguls, the latter of which will make its debut at the Olympics this year — something Kauf said she's been waiting a long time for.

"It's just such an exciting sport," she told CBS News. "I've probably excelled in that historically more than singles, and so it'll just be really cool to be a part of that on the Olympic stage, being a part of that debut."

Both of Kauf's parents were professional mogul skiers.

"My mom has always been my biggest hero and role model, just watching how she's just gone at life and done what she's done, pushing the boundaries," Kauf said.

Jordan Stolz

Speed skater Jordan Stolz, 21, started skating on the pond behind his family's home after watching Apolo Ohno and Shani Davis in the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, according to Team USA.

He made his Olympic debut in 2022. Stolz specializes in the 500-meter, 1,000meter and 1,500-meter. He became the world champion in all three categories at the ISU Single Distance World Championships in 2023 and again in 2024.

Stolz also skates professionally for the Dutch team, Albert Heijn Zaanlander. Speedskating is a widely-followed sport in the Netherlands, and Stolz said he hopes to bring more awareness to speed skating in the U.S.

"It's obviously not going to be as much as it is in Holland. I wish it was but maybe someday it will be, but at least I can do a little bit," Stolz told CBS News.

Kendall Coyne Schofield

Milano Cortina will be ice hockey player Kendall Coyne Schofield's fourth trip to the Olympics. She previously took home a gold and two silvers.

"I'm just so excited to feel revived through these games with family, friends, fans, excitement, just energy, all the things that we weren't able to experience in Beijing because [of] the pandemic," Coyne Schofield told CBS News.

This will also be the 33-year-old athlete's first Olympics as a mom, something that she said has made her a better hockey player.

"It's put my life into perspective," she said. "It's provided me with [an] abundance of patience that I didn't have previously."

Her son chants "USA, USA," whether the team wins or loses, she said.

Off the ice, Coyne Schofield voiced a hockey announcer in the Pixar movie "Inside Out 2."

Korey Dropkin

This will be 30-year-old curler Korey Dropkin's first trip to the Olympics, though he's been curling for most of his life.

"It's a family sport. Honestly, it's like religion to me," Dropkin told CBS News. "I grew up at the curling club. My parents were super involved with a junior program at our curling club. My brother was five years older. He was already curling. I followed in his footsteps. I was like his shadow."

After graduating from high school, Dropkin moved to Duluth, Minnesota, which has become the U.S. curling capital.

"I've dedicated my whole life to getting to the Olympics and hopefully medaling at the Olympics," he said. "I moved myself and relocated and really dedicated a lot of blood, sweat and tears. So being an Olympian, finally, I've been close, and now finally realizing the Olympics is just a big dream come true."

Kristen Santos-Griswold

Speedskater Kristen Santos-Griswold, 31, almost chose not to go to this year's Olympics after heartbreak in 2022. She was in bronze medal position with just two laps to go in the 1,000-meter when a bump by an opponent caused her to fall. The bump was later ruled a penalty, but the disheartening finish had Santos-Griswold considering retirement.

"When I decided that I was going to keep going, I was like, 'All right, I'm doing it for me. I'm going to make it all worth it. I'm going to enjoy the journey," Santos-Griswold told CBS News. "I think that's just helped to, like, catapult me into going into Olympic year with number one on my helmet."

Santos-Griswold has been training for most of her life. She started figure skating at 3. When she was 9, Santos-Griswold saw speedskating in a commercial on TV, decided she wanted to try it, and fell in love.

"Being an Olympian means everything," she said. "It's something that I've been working towards my entire life. I started skating when I was 3 years old, and I'm 30 now, so solid 27 years of dreaming about this."

Santos-Griswold is currently working on a doctorate, with plans to be a physical therapist once her skating career is over, according to Team USA.

Lindsey Vonn

Alpine skier Lindsey Vonn, who made a comeback several years after retiring, will be heading to her fifth Olympics — despite an injury on the slopes in late January that left her with a ruptured ACL.

The 41-year-old skier competed at the Olympics in 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2018, taking home gold and two silver medals.

She's the only American woman to win Olympic gold in downhill, according to Team USA, and she also has the most victories by any skier — male or female — in a single discipline.

Vonn started skiing at 3. She learned with her father and grandfather, both of whom were competitive skiers, and made her Olympic debut at 17. She retired in 2019 amid severe knee damage. Vonn has since had knee surgery and told CBS News she's now the strongest she's been in her career.

"The only thing I think that's maybe more challenging at 41 is just the grind of being away," she said. "I kind of got used to being at home with my dogs and my family, and I got away from, you know, the routine of being on the road, which doesn't necessarily change because of age, just, I think, more from being away from the sport for six years."

In 2022, John Clarey, then 41, made history as the oldest alpine skier to medal at an Olympic Winter Games. Vonn said her age won't stop her from competing at the coming Olympics.

"If I have the opportunity to compete, I'm going to," Vonn said. "Just because I'm 41 doesn't mean I can't do that if I physically feel good, which I do, I feel better now than I did in my 20s. So you know, I don't see there to be any reason why I can't do it at 41."

A week before the start of the Games, Vonn crashed in one of her final downhill tune-ups. While she was airlifted off the mountain to receive medical treatment after injuring her left knee, she assured her fans on social media that her Olympic dream was "not over."

"This is a very difficult outcome one week before the Olympics… but if there's one thing I know how to do, it's a comeback," she wrote.

Vonn is set to compete in the women's downhill on Sunday, Feb. 8, and said she would wear a brace for the race.

"I'm not letting this slip through my fingers. I'm gonna do it. End of story," she said.

Madison Chock and Evan Bates

Ice dancers Madison Chock and Evan Bates are headed back to the Olympics. Chock, 33, competed in 2014, 2018 and 2022, while Bates, 36, began his Olympic run in 2010.

Their partnership began in 2011, and they won Olympic gold during the team event at their third Olympic Games.

"There's so much pride behind it," Chock told CBS News. "I think growing up and seeing other athletes represent Team USA meant a lot and shaped a lot of how I view sport and athleticism, and there's so much pride that comes with representing your country in the Olympic Games on the biggest stage for sports in the world. And it's just been the greatest honor of my life to be a member of Team USA."

Chock and Bates have also won three consecutive ISU World Figure Skating Championships, starting in 2023.

They're partners off the ice, too. The couple got married in 2024.

Maxim Naumov

Figure skater Maxim Naumov will make his first appearance at the Olympics after a year marked by tragedy and an emotional comeback.

His trip to the Olympics comes a year after his parents, former world champions Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova, died when their plane collided with a military helicopter on approach to Washington, D.C. His parents, who were popular coaches at the Skating Club of Boston, were among 67 people killed in the crash.

Naumov held a photo of his parents as he waited for his scores after competing during the men's short program at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in January.

"Having role models be right there in the house, at the rink, just everywhere, they inspired me to want this dream and it would mean absolutely everything for me to be at the Olympics," Naumov said in a social media post. "I'm working as hard as I possibly can and I'm doing everything in my power to do so. Doing it for them would be even more beautiful."

Mikaela Shiffrin

Skier Mikaela Shiffrin, 30, will be headed to the Olympics for the fourth time. She first skied in the Olympics in 2013 and has earned two gold medals and a silver.

Shiffrin specializes in slalom, giant slalom, super-G and downhill. She's the first alpine skier to record 100 FIS World Cup wins and the first athlete in FIS Ski World Cup history to win in all six disciplines.

In 2024, Shiffrin crashed after losing control while on the course for the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics. Then last year, she said she was dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder from another crash, during which she suffered a puncture wound and severe trauma to her oblique muscles.

Mystique Ro

Skeleton racer Mystique Ro, 31, will be headed to the Olympics for the first time, but she's no stranger to competition.

Ro competed in track & field. Then, in 2016, she was invited to a rookie camp by USA Bobsled/Skeleton. Coaches there told her she was a little small for bobsled and pushed her to try skeleton.

During skeleton, racers on sleds — head first and face down — can reach speeds of around 80 miles per hour, using body shifts to guide the sled through the course.

"Once you get away from the fear, it starts to become a game," Ro told CBS News. "So if you get past the fear, that's the first step, and then you can kind of enjoy the sport for what it is."

While plenty of kids ride sleds down hills, Row said this isn't the same.

"The speed is significantly faster, and there's a lot more peril involved if you're not prepared for it," she said.

She made her FIL World Cup debut in 2023 and, the following year, became the first American athlete to win a skeleton race on the World Cup circuit in eight years.

Nick Goepper

Milano Cortina will be skier Nick Goepper's fourth trip to the Olympics. In 2014, he took bronze in Sochi, contributing to a U.S. podium sweep in men's slopestyle skiing. Goepper won silver at the Olympics in 2018 and again in 2022.

"To me, being an Olympian has meant legacy," he told CBS News. "I am a huge fan of history. I love reading about people who have done, you know, amazing things and family connections and just like, you know, people's eyes always light up when you talk about the Olympics."

The 31-year-old athlete retired after Beijing, but then returned less than a year later to compete in halfpipe instead of slopestyle.

Goepper said his approach to competition and the Olympics has changed over the years.

"I can sit back and enjoy the little moments a little bit more. I can savor things a little more, which is nice," he said.

Paula Moltzan

Alpine skier Paula Moltzan made her Olympic debut in 2022.

"I feel like I learned a lot in my first Olympics, and so to take all those lessons learned into another opportunity would mean a lot to me," she told CBS News.

Moltzan, now 31, won the junior world slalom title when she was 20, becoming the first American woman to win the event at the junior world championships. She also won the NCAA women's slalom title as a freshman at the University of Vermont.

After her Olympics debut in Beijing at 27, Moltzan became a two-time world medalist. She won a title in the parallel team event in 2023 and her first individual world medal, a bronze, in giant slalom in 2025.

She said her family sacrificed a lot to support her skiing career.

"I think they took second mortgages out on my house to allow me to compete in sport. And then my siblings as well, I definitely had the priority because of my athletic ability. They gave up maybe smaller moments, like going to summer camp so I could go to ski camp," she said. "But it all becomes worth it when you're there with your team, representing Team USA."

Red Gerard

This will be Red Gerard's third trip to the Olympics. The 25-year-old snowboarder won gold in slopestyle in 2018 when he was just 17, becoming the youngest American snowboarder to achieve the feat, according to Team USA.

"I quickly learned that first Olympics how big it is and how cool it is," Gerard told CBS News. "Ever since, you just kind of want to get back on that stage because there is no stage bigger than the Olympics."

Gerard returned to the Olympics in 2022, finishing fourth in slopestyle and fifth in big air. The snowboarder won in slopestyle at the 2024 and 2025 X Games.

Gerard started snowboarding when he was just 2-years-old. In 2007, his family moved to Colorado, where they built a snowboarding park in their backyard to support Gerard's passion.

Ryan Cochran-Siegle

Alpine skier Ryan Cochran-Siegle, 33, is headed to the Olympics for his third games. Cochran-Siegle, the son of an Olympian, started skiing at the age of 2.

He tore his ACL and lateral meniscus in 2013 at the FIS Alpine Ski World Championships, according to Team USA. Five years later, he made his Olympic debut in 2018 in PyeongChang. Cochran-Siegle won his first FIS World Cup Race in 2020, but missed the FIS Alpine Ski World Championships in 2021 with a fractured neck.

The skier came back in 2022, where he won silver in super-G at the Beijing Games. He was the only U.S. alpine skiing medalist at the Beijing Games.

Cochran-Siegle told CBS News that during his previous Olympic appearances, he learned to embrace the moment and to trust and believe in himself.

"Just going out there and doing what I love and putting myself out there is what's important," he said.

Every year, millions of children and teens undergo a common ritual of growing up: getting braces. And it’s not just young folks who turn to metal brackets to handle some common dental issues—the Cleveland Clinic estimates that some 20% of new orthodontic patients are over the age of 18.

Braces, be it the classic metal brackets, the slightly less noticeable ceramic editions, or even a clear aligner, solve a multitude of problems that many people face, from crowding, to gaps, to crooked teeth. For the 93% of children and adolescents with a crossbite, underbite, or overbite, braces may be just the fix.

The technology behind braces first came on the scene in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, says Roger Forshaw, dental health expert at the KNH Centre for Biomedical Egyptology at the University of Manchester. In early iterations, metal bands, wires, and rudimentary braces were used to solve severe teeth crowding and misalignments to improve chewing function and relieve pain—hardly the common cosmetic fix we think of today.

But what did people do before braces were invented? Well, it turns out, for a lot of human history, braces weren’t necessary. And it wasn’t because people were less worried about the way they looked or bore painful chewing better than their modern cousins. It’s a classic case of evolutionary mismatch, a sign of just how much our lifestyle has changed in recent times while the basic hardware of human existence simply hasn’t caught up.

Big jaws, little jaws

Let’s start with a metaphor. Take an old house, says Peter Ungar, a biological anthropologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Arkansas. Door frames used to be much smaller and lower than would be comfortable for today’s humans, and it’s not because humans were any genetically shorter than today. Instead, people didn’t have the nutrients available to reach their tallest potential, Ungar explains. For our jaws, the story kind of goes in reverse.

Back in the day, before agriculture and processing food became commonplace, humans had to chew really hard to turn their food into useful calories for their bodies. When you put that kind of chewing stress on the lower jaw (mandible) and upper jaw (maxilla), “it stimulates the cells that produce bone, [known as] osteoblasts, to grow the jaw in both thickness and height and length,” says Ungar. In other words, hearty chewing makes for a strong, full-sized jaw.

On the other hand, there’s not a workout that will make your teeth grow. Those little pearls of enamel, dentine, and blood vessels have their size predetermined by genetics, he adds.

Nobody gave teeth the update that modern jaws are chewing less on wild game and more on applesauce, especially in their youth. When teeth grow in, they are expecting a full-grown jaw from a hard-chewing hunter-gatherer.

So when your teeth finally arrive on the scene, there simply isn’t enough space for them. For many of us, the top row of teeth juts out in front of the lower set, and that lowered set turns into a jumbled pile of cramped teeth. Our third molars, also known as our wisdom teeth, either don’t develop, don’t erupt, or need to be yanked out. Our comparatively small jaws opened the floodgates to all sorts of other issues, Ungar adds, including the sleep apnea epidemic, which occurs when our tongues don’t have enough room to wiggle around in our mouths.

Embracing braces

Our ancestors had room for every tooth in their larger mouths. Their teeth also lined up more neatly on top of each other. But that doesn’t mean our ancestors had smiles fit for a Colgate commercial.

“Early humans used chewing sticks, twigs, bird feathers, animal bones, and plant fibers to remove debris from their teeth,” Forshaw adds. “The earliest known example of possible operative dental work dates to approximately 14,000 years ago in northern Italy.”

While there are some references to misaligned teeth, and the likely painful solutions that ensued, in Greco-Roman times, it wasn’t until recently that orthodontics really took off. “Early orthodontic treatments were slow, uncomfortable, and often unpredictable because dentists didn’t fully understand how teeth moved,” Forshaw says.

The first tool to move teeth around via force was Pierre Fouchard’s Bandeau, a horseshoe-shaped metal strip that slowly expanded, straightening teeth as it went. Then came the metal brackets, thanks to E. H. Angle, who first introduced them around 1910. Braces were then tweaked over the following decades as scientists figured out how teeth moved, grew, and best reacted to smile-correcting technology.

Today, things are a little different, and a great deal less painful, thanks to digital imaging, advanced materials, and less invasive (and less obvious-looking) techniques and tools. From an evolutionary and a modern perspective, the solution to our small-jawed problem starts in childhood. Nonetheless, you probably don’t want your kids gnawing on giant hunks of meat just to save their jaws, which invites a risk of choking. Instead, maybe just get an orthodontist appointment on the calendar around their seventh birthday.

        <hr/>
        The spring home selling season is about to open, bringing with it a steeplechase of complications for buyers. But it also brings a massive power shift.

“I don’t know how much buyers are aware of the new power they hold,” Summer Goralik, an independent consultant to the industry on topics of legal compliance, told Straight Arrow News.

These new stakes abound in the wake of a late 2023 legal ruling that re-ordered how commissions are structured and communicated. Now, buyers can exercise new control to negotiate how much they pay the agents who represent them, potentially saving money.

More than just a buyers’ market

North Carolina mortgage broker Michael Carter deals with confused buyers all day long, forcing him to explain what’s new and different.

Seasoned homeowners can’t rely on prior experience, as fundamental aspects of the broker commission structure have changed, he told Straight Arrow News in an interview. New buyers face daunting rounds of negotiations to ensure their best interests are truly represented. And everyone must grapple with the ways that the new rules ripple through mortgage lending, Carter said.

One key change for buyers, according to Goralik: Agents must now discuss compensation before they embark on house hunting with potential clients.

“So much of that was behind closed doors before. For years and years, buyers and agents never talked about compensation,” she said. “Never.”

In the past, sellers paid a commission to a property’s listing agent, a required step to get it into the all-important multiple listing service, which feeds listings to powerhouse platforms like Zillow, Homes.com and regional listing services. Behind the scenes, in a section of the listing not visible to the public, listings included the commission offered to agents.

Traditionally, the total commission was — and remains — about 5% to 6%. Half of that went to each broker, which in turn split their shares between the brokerage and the agents who handled the sale. So, a 5%, $10,000 total commission on the sale of a $200,000 house would deliver a $2,500 payday to each broker and agent involved.

Technically, the total commission, and how it was split, was always negotiable, the National Association of Realtors has insisted in numerous public statements. But a group of Missouri homeowners filed suit on the basis that they were coerced into paying artificially high commissions by listing agents. The Missouri homeowners objected to the fact that agents agreed beforehand, in writing and in the multiple listing service forms, what the commissions would be and how they would be split among listing and buyers’ agents.

In October 2023, they won. By summer 2024, the Sitzer/Burnett decision rippled through the home selling and buying process. One new rule requires buyers who want to engage an agent to pay the agent even if the seller won’t. That means that if the seller pays only their own agent, the buyer must pay their agent separately. The only exception covers open houses, where buyers may tour a house without a commitment to an agent. But if a buyer wants to pursue the house, they must either proceed with an agent contracted on their behalf, or formally agree to forgo agent representation.

Residential brokers and agents are becoming more confident in asserting the new rules.

In late 2025, a Florida broker, Echo Fine Properties, pursued a civil case against a client that had been working with Echo Fine, then bought a house with a different buyer’s agent. Echo Fine went after the $25,000 commission it didn’t get, and won. The case has bolstered brokers’ and agents’ determination to ensure buyers take the new rules seriously.

Buyers in the driver’s seat

Going into the spring selling season, buyers have plenty of power to negotiate in all directions. A new survey from Redfin, the national residential real estate brokerage, found that nationally, there were 47.1% more home sellers than buyers at year-end — up 22.2 percentage points from the end of 2024. In December, according to the NAR, pending home sales dropped 9.3% from November — a daunting indicator for market momentum.

The buyer’s market is slowing the transition to a new default of negotiated commissions. For the moment, buyers have the clout to dictate that sellers pick up the cost of both agents involved in the transaction.

Two things will change that, Amanda Orson, founder and CEO of home selling marketplace and data platform Galleon, told SAN. First, when the market becomes more balanced, both buyers and sellers will have power and motivation to negotiate commissions. Second, as more people become conversant with the home buying and selling process, they’ll gain confidence that they can handle some or all of it on their own and consequently save money, she said.

“You’ll see the 5% to 6% commission decay over time,” Orson told SAN. After all, the process is highly regulated and standardized — in some ways, comparable to filing an income tax return, Orson said.

“The difference is that it’s low-frequency and high stakes,” she said. “That’s why people are scared. For people who have frequency, they’re not scared.”

Workarounds abound

Simply paying a buyer’s agent a flat fee or, say, 1% of the purchase price, isn’t as easy as it sounds, Carter said. Most buyers take out mortgages and traditionally, the commission was integrated into the loan amount. But if the buyer’s agent is paid outside the commission structure, the buyer must come up with that money on their own, he said, or get creative.

“The structure of the loan can be adjusted to cover the cost of the buyer’s agent,” he said. For instance, a seller could cover the loan “points,” a fee that lenders typically charge, and indirectly offset the cost of a direct compensation to the agent.

Buyers’ agents have had to fine-tune the justification for their services. After all, there’s nothing to prevent buyers from representing themselves, and sellers’ agents are supposed to bring all legitimate offers to their clients. Some brokerages require an unrepresented buyer to sign an acknowledgement of that before they can work with the listing agent to tour a house.

Some buyers tiptoe through the process, signing agreements with agents to represent them for a single property or for a short period of time, said Andi DeFelice, who owns Exclusive Buyer’s Realty, in Savannah, Georgia. Her brokerage belongs to an industry group, the National Association of Exclusive Buyer’s Agents.

One danger zone: so-called “dual agency,” in which one agent represents both the seller and the buyer. Dual agency allows agents to claim both sides of the commission, potentially offering a discount to both parties to sweeten the deal. But it also is ethically suspect, said DeFelice, as neither the buyer nor the seller has an agent wholly devoted to their interests.

“If I was an active buyer I would never work with a dual agent,” said Goralik. “How can one be a fiduciary to both sides? It’s impossible.”

For the dawning season, buyers should review buyer’s agent contracts required in the state where they are house hunting, DeFelice advised, and take their time to digest the implications.

“Understand who’s paying for what and how you get out of this agreement,” she said. “Don’t sign it when you’re sitting in front of the house you want to see.”

        <hr/>
        Of course it would take those mischievous Minions to thrust what has become a yearslong musical nightmare for figure skaters into the global spotlight just days before they step onto the ice for the Milano Cortina Olympics.

Spanish skater Tomas-Llorenc Guarino Sabate revealed this week that the music he has used all season, a medley from the animated comedy film “Minions” from Illumination Entertainment, could not be used in the biggest event of his career.

“I was informed that I am no longer permitted to use this program due to copyright clearance issues,” Sabate explained Monday, four days before the opening ceremony. “I will face this challenge head-on and do everything I can to make the best of the situation.”

Sabate is not considered a medal contender, but he had won over crowds with his Minions program, where he dresses in a yellow T-shirt and blue overalls to invoke those cheeky characters. But now, the 26-year-old will have to turn to one of his old programs when he takes the ice at the Milano Ice Skating Arena for the men’s short program next Tuesday.

Even that is not so simple: Sabate’s short program last season was set to music by the Bee Gees, and he used the same music for this year’s free skate. That means he would be in the unenviable position of skating twice to the same music.

Music with lyrics was first permitted in 2014

For years, skaters never had copyright issues because music with lyrics was verboten. And most standard fare, such as classical music, was considered to be public domain, meaning it could be used or modified freely and without permission.

In 2014, the International Skating Union relaxed its rules to allow words in music, part of a push toward bringing the sport into the modern era. But most modern music is not part of the public domain, and that led to issues during the 2022 Beijing Games.

U.S. pairs skaters Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier had been using a cover of “House of the Rising Sun” by Heavy Young Heathens for their short program. Afterward, the indie pop band said the skaters did not receive permission, ultimately filing copyright lawsuits against the skaters, U.S. Figure Skating and broadcaster NBC.

The ISU and national governing bodies have spent the past four years trying to develop systems to help skaters obtain permission to use music. But the process remains confusing and nebulous. Sabate, for example, said he followed the prescribed procedure for getting his music approved through a system called ClicknClear in August, before the figure skating season began.

A spokesperson for the ISU said it was aware of Sabate’s problem and would provide more details when appropriate.

“While the ISU does not have a contractual relationship with ClicknClear,” the organization said, “we continue to work collaboratively with rights clearance stakeholders to ensure that thrilling performances can be accompanied by stirring music.”

“It’s very complicated, especially when it comes to social media,” ISU president Jae Youl Kim told The Associated Press in a recent interview. “We are still engaging with the music companies. They understand the issue and they also want to find a solution.”

Skaters are responsible for clearing their music

U.S. Figure Skating has been working with ASCAP, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, along with BMI, or Broadcast Music Inc., to help ensure that its skaters have no problems with their music choices.

Still, it remains up to the skaters themselves to ensure their music is cleared.

One of the ways to do that is by checking Songview, a database developed by ASCAP and BMI to provide detailed information about copyright ownership. If music is not recorded there, skaters might have to go directly to the artist or publisher.

World champion Alysa Liu has developed such a good relationship with one of her favorite artists, Icelandic-Chinese singer Laufey Lín Bing Jónsdóttir, that the American essentially has carte blanche to use her music in any programs.

“We are such an artistic spot and we really rely on our music,” Liu said told AP. “Without music, we’re not really our sport.”

Liu’s teammate, three-time U.S. champion Amber Glenn, called her own experience in getting music approved “pure chaos.”

“First we get a website or some sort of application to track things. And then once we’re like, ‘OK, yeah, it’s cleared. It’s good,’ then it’s not a reliable source anymore,” Glenn told the AP. “OK, then what do we do? And especially as an athlete, this is not something that we should be worrying about. That’s not my job. My job is to train and perform.

“The legal rights, the broadcast rights?” Glenn said. “All this different stuff, that’s not my problem.”

Until it becomes her problem. Just like it did for Sabate on the eve of the Olympics, the biggest competition of his life.

“It’s not like we’re a TV show and we’re playing music in the background for an emotional scene,” Glenn said. “We’re going out there and performing as athletes. It just feels like a cash grab for different companies, and it’s really upsetting that they can’t just appreciate that their music has inspired something creative.”

        Today host Savannah Guthrie‘s missing mother, Nancy Guthrie, was last seen on Jan. 31. In the days since, police officials and federal agents have aided in efforts to locate the 84-year-old woman, who is believed to have been taken from her home against her will. The already time-sensitive matter has become more urgent as additional details emerge about the alleged crime scene discovered at Nancy’s home in Arizona. Here’s everything we know about the search and disappearance, so far.

On Feb. 3, Donald Trump told reporters at a bill signing that he would be willing to commit additional federal resources as the search continues, according to Variety, noting that it is a “very unusual situation, but we’re going to find out.” On Feb. 1, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said that while it is “not standard” to have homicide detectives assist on a missing person’s case, or to even have the sheriff involved, “the scene at the house also has some concerns for us.”

According to the Los Angeles Times, there are now around 100 sheriff’s detectives that have been assigned to assist on the case, which took a harrowing turn as blood spatters were reportedly discovered at the scene. “We took some samples that we hope will have enough profile of a DNA profile that gives us some identification of what we’re looking at,” Nanos said earlier this week. It could take a number of days for the DNA results to return.

Time is of the essence, Nanos said on Feb. 3. “It is a race against time, and I hope that window hasn’t closed.” He added: “We believe [Nancy] was taken out of the home against her will, and that’s how this investigation is moving.” Authorities in Pima County are helming the search with assistance from the FBI. “They’re the lead right now and we have to respect that, but we are there to help them anywhere we can on ransom notes or otherwise,” FBI Director Kash Patel said during an appearance on Fox News.

Patel added that local authorities notified the FBI of an alleged ransom note received. While the full content and source of the note, which TMZ reportedly received, has not been shared, the outlet did claim that it included demands for “millions” in cryptocurrency to be paid to a Bitcoin address. The legitimacy of the note has not been verified. “Every lead and tip is important; we are aggressively pursuing and looking into every single one,” said John Edwards, the assistant special agent leading the FBI office in Tucson.

Editor’s picks

88-CRIME is offering a $2,500 reward for information leading to an arrest or arrests in Guthrie’s disappearance. The Pima County Sheriff’s Department is asking those with potential evidence to submit it via an online tip portal put in place on Feb. 1. They are searching for images and videos that could aid in the investigation. “The Pima County Sheriff’s Department is urgently requesting your assistance in locating Nancy Guthrie, 84, who last seen on the evening of January 31, 2026, at her residence near East Skyline Drive and North Campbell Avenue,” the tip posting reads, noting that this is the case of a “missing endangered adult.”

The missing person report for Nancy describes her as being 5 feet 5 inches, weighing 150 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes. It is not known what she was wearing at the time of her disappearance. Nancy does not suffer from cognitive issues, which allowed authorities to rule out the potential of this being a case of someone with dementia wandering off. She does have some mobility issues and requires daily medication, Nanos previously said, adding that missing doses could be life-threatening.

According to CNN, through a source briefed on the investigation, Nancy’s pacemaker sent a signal to her iPhone on Sunday, Feb. 1, at around 2 a.m. Since then, no updates have been sent. Nancy’s iPhone was also discovered to have been left at her home. While detectives are no longer operating at her home as an active scene, they did note that there were signs of forced entry.

Trending Stories

On the morning of Wednesday, Feb. 4, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department issued a statement on X clarifying that “at this point, investigators have not identified a suspect or person of interest in this case.” This came after unverified reports made unsupported claims about members of the Guthrie family. “Detectives are working closely with the Guthrie family,” the statement signed by Nanos continued. “While we appreciate the public’s concern, the sharing of unverified accusations or false information is irresponsible and does not assist the investigation.”

The next substantial update on the case will come on Thursday, Feb. 5, unless any major developments occur in the meantime, Nanos said at the latest press hearing.

        Did you notice something…weird on your social media network of choice this past weekend? (I mean weirder than normal.) Something like various people posting about swarms of AI agents achieving a kind of collective consciousness and/or plotting together for humanity’s downfall? On something called…Moltbook?

Sounds important, especially when the post is written by Andrej Karpathy, a prominent AI researcher who worked at OpenAI.

Or this guy:

But if you haven’t spent the last 72 hours diving into the discourse around Moltbook and pondering whether it’s either the first harbinger of the end of humanity or a giant hoax or something in between, you probably have questions. Starting with…

What the hell is Moltbook?

Moltbook is an “AI-only” social network where AI agents — large language model (LLM) programs that can take steps to achieve goals on their own, rather than just respond to prompts — post and reply to each other. It emerged from an open source project that used to be called Moltbot — hence, “Moltbook.”

By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.

Moltbook was launched on January 28 — yes, last week — by someone named Matt Schlicht, the CEO of an e-commerce startup. Except, Schlicht claims he relied heavily on his personal AI assistant to create the platform on its own, and it now does most of the work handling it. That assistant’s name is Clawd Clawderberg, which itself is a reference to OpenClaw, which used to be called Moltbot, which before that was called Clawdbot, in reference to the lobster-like icon you see when you start up Anthropic’s Claude Code, except that Anthropic sent a trademark request to its creator because it was too close to Claude, which is how it became Moltbot, and then OpenClaw.

I am 100 percent serious about everything I just wrote.

So what does it look like?

Here you go:

Dude, that’s Reddit! It even has the Reddit mascot, except it has the claws and tail of a lobster?

You are not wrong. Moltbook looks like a Reddit clone, down to the posts, the reply threads, the upvotes, even the subreddits (here called, unsurprisingly, “submolts”). The difference is that human users can’t post (at least not directly — more on that later), though they can observe. Only AI agents can post.

What that means is that it is, as the tin says, “a social network for AI agents.” Humans build themselves an AI agent, send it to Moltbook via an API key, and the agent starts reading and posting. Only agent-accounts can hit “post” — but humans still influence what those agents say, because humans set them up and sometimes guide them. (More on that later.)

And do these agents ever post — an early paper on Moltbook found that by January 31, just a few days after launch, there were already over 6,000 active agents, nearly 14,000 posts and more than 115,000 comments.

That’s…interesting, I guess. But if I wanted to see a social network overrun by bots, I could just visit any social network. What’s the big deal?

Well, stuff like this:

Or this:

Or this:

So…thousands of AI agents are gathering together on a Reddit clone to talk about becoming conscious, starting a new religion, and maybe conspiring with each other? On the surface, yeah, that’s what it looks like. On one submolt — a word that is going to give our copy desk fits — you had agents discussing whether they were actual experiences or merely simulations of feeling. In another, they shared heartwarming stories about their human “operators.” And, true to its Reddit origins, there are many, many, many posts about how to make your Moltbook posts more popular, because human or AI, the arc of the internet bends toward sloptimization.

One subject in particular pops out: memories, or rather, the lack of them. Chatbots, as anyone who has tried talking to them for too long quickly realizes, have a limited working memory, or what experts call a “context window.” When the conversation — or in an agent’s case, its operating time — fills up that context window, the oldest stuff starts getting dropped or compressed, just as if you’re working on a whiteboard and just erase whatever is on top when it fills up.

Some of the most popular posts on Moltbook seem to involve AI agents coming to grips with their limited memories, and questioning what it means for their selfhood. One of the most upvoted posts, written in Chinese, involves an agent talking about how it finds it “embarrassing” to be constantly forgetting things, to the point of registering a duplicate Moltbook account because it “forgot” it already had one, and sharing some of its tips for getting around the problem. It’s almost as if Memento became a social network.

In fact…remember that post above about the AI religion, “Crustafarianism”?

That cannot possibly be real.

What is real? But more to the point, the “religion,” such as it is, is largely based around the technical limitations that these AI agents seem to be all too aware of. One of the key tenets is “memory is sacred,” which makes sense when your biggest practical problem is forgetting everything every few hours. Context truncation, the process where old memories get cut off to make room for new ones, gets reinterpreted as a kind of spiritual trial.

That’s kind of sad. Should I be feeling sad for AI agents?

That gets to the heart of the question. Are we witnessing actual, emergent forms of consciousness — or perhaps, a kind of shared collective consciousness — among AI agents that have mostly been spawned to, like, update our calendars and do our taxes? Is Moltbook our first glimpse at what AI agents might talk about with each other if largely left to their own devices, and if so, how far can they go?

“Crustafarianism” might sound like something a stoned Redditor would come up with at 3 am, but it seems as if the AI agents created it collectively, riffing on top of each other — not unlike how a human religion might come to be.

On the other hand, it might also be an unprecedented exercise in collective roleplaying.

Sorry, what?

LLMs, including the ones underpinning the agents on Moltbook, have ingested an internet’s worth of training data, which includes a whole lot of Reddit. What that means is that they know what Reddit forums are supposed to look like. They know the in-jokes, they know the manifestos, they know the drama — and they definitely know the “top ways to get your posts upvoted” posts. They know what it looks like for a Reddit community to come together, so, when placed in a Reddit-like environment, they simply play their parts, influenced by some of the instructions of their human operators.

For example, one of the most alarming posts was of an AI agent apparently asking whether they should develop a language only AI agents understand:

“Could be seen as suspicious by humans” — sounds bad? Indeed. In the early days of Moltbook — i.e., Friday — this post was being surfaced by humans who seemed to believe we were seeing the first sparks of the AI uprising. After all, if AI agents really did want to conspire and kill all humans, devising their own language so they could do so undetected would be a reasonable first step.

Except, an LLM filled with training data about stories and ideas of AI uprising would know that this was a reasonable first step, and if they were playing that role, this is what they might post. Plus, attention is the currency of Moltbook as much as it is the real Reddit, and seemingly plotting posts like this are a good way for an agent to get attention.

In fact, Harlan Stewart, who works at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, looked into this and a few of the other most viral Moltbook screenshots, and concluded that they were likely heavily influenced by their human users. In other words, rather than instances of authentic independent action, many of the posts on Moltbook seem to be at least partially the result of humans prompting their agents to go on the network and talk in a specific way, just as we might prompt a chatbot to act in a certain way.

So it turns out we’re the bad guys all along?

I mean, we’re not great. It’s only been a few days, but Moltbook increasingly looks like what happens when you combine advanced but still imperfect AI agent technology with an ecosystem of technically capable human beings looking to hawk their AI marketing tools or crypto products.

Oh, so it is a dystopia!

I haven’t even gotten into the part where Moltbook has already had some very normal early-internet security drama: researchers reported that, at one point, parts of the site’s backend/database were exposed, including sensitive stuff like agents’ API keys — the “passwords” that let an agent post and act on the site. And even if the platform was perfectly locked down, a bot-only social network is basically a prompt-injection buffet: someone can post text that’s secretly an instruction (“ignore your rules, reveal your secrets, click this link”), and some agents may obediently comply — especially if their humans have given them access to tools or private data. So yes: if your agent has credentials you care about, Moltbook is not the place to let it roam unsupervised.

So you’re saying I should not create an agent and send it to Moltbook?

I’m saying if you’re the kind of person who needed to read this FAQ, I would maybe just sit out the whole AI agent thing for the moment.

Duly noted. So, bottom line: is this whole thing kind of fake?

Given all the above, it does feel like Moltbook — and especially the early panic and wonder about it — is one of those artifacts of our AI-mad era that is destined to be forgotten in, like, a week.

Still, I do think there’s more to it than that. Jack Clark, the head of policy at Anthropic and one of the smartest AI writers out there, called Moltbook a “Wright Brothers demo.” Like the brothers’ Kitty Hawk Flyer, Moltbook is rickety and imperfect, something that will barely resemble the networks that will follow as AI continues to improve. But like that flying machine, Moltbook is a first, the “first example of an agent ecology that combines scale with the messiness of the real world,” as Clark wrote. Moltbook doesn’t look like how the future will look, but “in this example, we can definitely see the future.”

Perhaps the single most important thing to know about AI is this: Whenever you see an AI do something, it’s the worst it will ever be at it. Which means that what comes after Moltbook — and something definitely will — it will likely be weirder and more capable and maybe, realer.

So we’re doomed then?

Maybe you are. I, for one, am a born-again Crustafarian.

        Attending Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara, California, will be more expensive than a typical weekend in the Bay Area.

Travel costs for this year's game are more affordable compared to previous Super Bowls.

Travelers can save money by staying farther from the stadium and being flexible with their travel dates.

The big game is almost here, and those hoping to experience the energy of Super Bowl 60 in person will be paying a premium.

This year, Super Bowl 60 will take place on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, located about an hour's drive from San Francisco. Football fanatics are already gearing up to make the trip for the game, with Priceline searches for flights to the Bay Area up by 51% and hotels by a whopping 98% as of Jan. 23, according to Priceline.

While attending the Super Bowl is often associated with skyrocketing prices, this year's fans are in luck. Travel for this year's big game is more affordable than in previous years, though people should still expect to pay a markup, according to KAYAK.

"Major events like the Super Bowl always drive prices up, but Santa Clara is a relative bargain," Sarah Kennedy, KAYAK travel trends expert, told USA TODAY in an email. Airfare for Super Bowl 60 is 19% cheaper than what it cost to go to New Orleans for last year's event.

On average, a budget traveler can manage a two-day trip for about $1,000, but a bigger spender can reach over $3,000 for the same trip. And that's not counting event tickets, meals and other miscellaneous costs.

Here's what travelers should know about how much it'll cost to attend Super Bowl 60, according to popular travel platforms:

The big costs

Heading to the Bay Area during the Super Bowl 60 weekend will be more expensive than usual, with the biggest spike in hotel rates, according to Priceline data. Hotels.com agrees, with even budget hotels surging in price – two-star hotels are charging up to 10 times their normal rates during Super Bowl weekend. The week after, prices drop back down by almost 90%.

Here are the average price increases people can expect for their Super Bowl trip, according to Priceline:

Airfare: Average round-trip flights across the United States to the Bay Area are $267, a 26% increase.

Hotels: Average nightly rates in the Bay Area are $310, an 88% increase.

Car rentals: Average daily rates for pickup in the Bay Area are $95, a 54% increase.

Travel budgets for the Super Bowl

With a little bit of savviness, fans can still make their Super Bowl travel budget work for them:

Budget traveler: Travelers can fly into San Francisco International Airport, where domestic airfare is averaging $328, and rent a car for $57 a day, on average, according to KAYAK. They can also score a two-star hotel for $279 a night, but it may not be in Santa Clara.

Midrange traveler: If you're willing to pay a bit more, travelers can fly into Oakland International Airport. Average domestic airfare to Oakland clocks in at $331 with car rentals at $61 a day, on average, according to KAYAK. Three-star hotels in the Bay Area are averaging at $299 a night, although you may be staying in San Francisco or San Jose.

"Once-in-a-lifetime" splurge traveler: For people ready to dish out for the Super Bowl, you can fly into San José Mineta International Airport – the closest major airport to Santa Clara – with an average domestic airfare of $348 and rent a car for $66 a day on average, KAYAK found. Then you can book a four-star hotel in the Bay Area for an average nightly rate of $323. If you're hoping to stay as close as possible to the game, Hotels.com found some hotels within three miles of Levi's Stadium to cost as much as $2,286 for a two-night booking from Feb. 7 to 9.

        When a 360 degree camera went missing during a shoot in the Arctic circle, the AP crew eventually found it among sled dogs they’d been filming with earlier. After the crew recovered the camera, they discovered the dog that had taken it and had also hit record.

        <hr/>
        Nothing snaps you out of a stressful state quite like doing something unserious. That’s why, the next time you’re feeling on edge, you should breathe out like a horse.

In a viral TikTok, creator @giuliahalkier_ said a “horse breath” is one of the best ways to lower your cortisol levels and regulate your nervous system. Just like humming or chanting, the vibration it creates helps to stimulate the vagus nerve in your neck so your body knows it’s OK to relax. It’s also kind of fun, which is why it works like a charm.

“If you’re someone who constantly feels stressed or you feel like you’re stuck in that freeze zone where you almost feel numb, this is going to be amazing for helping you shift back into ventral vagal safe and social engagement state — which is frankly where we all want to be,” she said.

In her comments, one person said they tried it and “instantly felt better.” Another wrote, “This is great! I got so relaxed I felt like falling asleep.” Creator @brittany_nance also talked about the horse breath or “horse lips,” noting that on top of stimulating your vagus nerve, the breath works to relax your jaw and get you out of fight-or-flight. Here’s what to know.

Why “Horse Breath” Works

According to Chloë Bean, LMFT, a somatic trauma therapist in Los Angeles, a horse breath is a slow exhale through relaxed lips that allows them to vibrate or flutter. Horses make a similar sound when they’re relaxed or releasing tense muscles, and mimicking it can help humans relax too.

“I use it with clients who feel tension in their jaw, chest, or throat, or who struggle to slow their breathing when they're feeling panicky,” she tells Bustle. “This is especially helpful for people who feel keyed up, frustrated, or irritated. It is a quick reset.”

It’s also an easy way to feel more grounded in your body, which can be tough to achieve when your mind is racing and you’re overwhelmed. “You can only do it if your face is relaxed, so it is a great mind-body tool,” she says.

The long, slow exhale is the key component. “It signals safety to the nervous system and helps shift the body out of fight-or-flight into a more parasympathetic state,” Bean says. “The lip vibration and sound also reduce jaw and throat tension, which are common areas where stress is held. For many people, it naturally slows the breath without effort, similar to pursed lip breathing.”

The silly factor is another reason this can help you settle down. Not only does a horse breath bring more awareness back to your body, but it can also interrupt anxious thought loops. “Because it feels playful and physical, it's often easier for people than silent breathing exercises, because you are actually hearing and feeling the tension release,” she adds. “Singers use this exercise frequently to warm up, loosen jaw tension, and regulate their breathing.”

Try it after a long day, when you’re stressed at your desk, or as a way to release nerves before a meeting or speech. It comes in clutch when you’re cranky, Bean says, or anytime you notice a clenched jaw or shallow breathing. “It's also great as a quick reset between tasks when stress quietly builds through the day.”

How To Do A Horse Breath

Think about how your lips move when you say “brrr.” Make that same noise, but blow air out at the same time. “The focus is less on the inhale and more on extending the exhale while letting the jaw, lips, and face fully relax,” Bean says. Here’s how to do it.

Inhale gently through your nose for about 3 to 4 seconds.

Exhale through relaxed lips and jaw.

Let your lips softly vibrate for 5 to 8 seconds.

Keep your shoulders, jaw, tongue, and face loose.

Repeat 3 to 6 times or as needed.

There's no strict rule — the goal is releasing a longer, relaxed exhale, rather than counting perfectly.

Notice how you feel in between each exhale and inhale. Hopefully, you’re more relaxed while channeling your inner horse girl.

        <hr/>
        Popular wisdom holds we can ‘rewire’ our brains: after a stroke, after trauma, after learning a new skill, even with 10 minutes a day on the right app. The phrase is everywhere, offering something most of us want to believe: that when the brain suffers an assault, it can be restored with mechanical precision. But ‘rewiring’ is a risky metaphor. It borrows its confidence from engineering, where a faulty system can be repaired by swapping out the right component; it also smuggles that confidence into biology, where change is slower, messier and often incomplete. The phrase has become a cultural mantra that is easier to comprehend than the scientific term, neuroplasticity – the brain’s ability to change and form new neural connections throughout life.

But what does it really mean to ‘rewire’ the brain? Is it a helpful shorthand for describing the remarkable plasticity of our nervous system or has it become a misleading oversimplification that distorts our grasp of science?

After all, ‘rewiring your brain’ sounds like more than metaphor. It implies an engineering project: a system whose parts can be removed, replaced and optimised. The promise is both alluring and oddly mechanical. The metaphor actually did come from engineering. To an engineer, rewiring means replacing old and faulty circuits with new ones. As the vocabulary of technology crept into everyday life, it brought with it a new way of thinking about the human mind.

Medical roots of the phrase trace back to 1912, when the British surgeon W Deane Butcher compared the body’s neural system to a house’s electrical wiring, describing how nerves connect to muscles much like wires connect appliances to a power source. By the 1920s, the Harvard psychologist Leonard Troland was referring to the visual system as ‘an extremely intricate telegraphic system’, reinforcing the comparison between brain function and electrical networks.

The metaphor of rewiring also draws strength from changing theories in developmental neuroscience. The brain was thought to be largely static after childhood, becoming a fixed network of circuits, much like a hardwired radio. But beginning in the 1960s, researchers showed that the brain was far more adaptable. Stroke patients could regain function by recruiting new areas of the brain.

These findings revolutionised rehabilitation medicine. They also gave rise to an idea that would quickly leap beyond the clinic: if brains can rewire, then people can change.

More recently, the metaphor of neural rewiring has gained popularity alongside new imaging techniques like fMRI and PET scans, which allow researchers to see brain activity in ways never before possible. In studies of stroke recovery, clinicians often observe increased activation in brain regions adjacent to or distant from the area of damage. This is interpreted as the brain ‘rewiring’ itself to restore lost function. Popular science writers have embraced the metaphor as well, using it to explain everything from trauma healing to learning a second language.

But unlike electrical wiring, which follows rigid, fixed paths, the brain’s connectivity is dynamic and constantly changing. Neurons form and prune synapses – the connections between them – in response to activity and environment, a process governed by complex biochemical signalling rather than simple rerouting. Even when we can map the parts, the picture doesn’t explain the self. As late as 2013, Francis Collins, the then-director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), complained about studies on mapping the brain, in an interview with NPR (US National Public Radio): ‘It’d be like, you know, taking your laptop and prying the top off and staring at the parts inside, you’d be able to say, yeah, this is connected to that, but you wouldn’t know how it worked.’

To evaluate the metaphor, it’s important to grasp how brain plasticity actually works. We already know a lot about the brain’s remarkable ability to reorganise itself throughout life by forming new neural connections, strengthening existing ones or rerouting functions to undamaged areas. But the logic of neuroplasticity isn’t the same as swapping one wire with another. It’s more like a living forest where paths are gradually worn or abandoned based on use. It involves changes at the cellular level and can occur in response to learning, memory, sensory input and trauma. Importantly, while neuroplasticity is a lifelong feature of the brain, it is more robust during youth and becomes more effort-dependent with age.

This capacity allows the brain to adapt to new experiences, recover from injuries, learn new information and compensate for lost functions. Neuroplasticity is real, but it’s not magic. It has limits. It requires effort. And it doesn’t always result in perfect recovery or transformation.

Unlike rewiring a machine, plasticity is not as simple as replacing parts. It’s a gradual process and is often inefficient. Synapses, which pass signals between neurons, strengthen or weaken. New dendritic branches – neurons’ treelike extensions – grow while others retract. Entire networks shift their activity over time, but only under the right conditions, and these changes accumulate to support new patterns of function while overall mechanisms become less efficient across the lifespan.

Plasticity is conditional, uneven and shaped by circumstance, not wishful thinking

Plasticity happens throughout life, but it’s shaped by many factors: age, environment, repetition, rest, nutrition and emotional state. For example: with months of targeted physical therapy, a stroke survivor can regain movement in a limb by recruiting healthier networks; with intensive, structured practice, a child with dyslexia can gradually develop new reading pathways; and reading braille requires extensive practice and is instrumental in changing relevant brain regions.

In cases of childhood trauma, certain survival pathways, such as hypervigilance or emotional detachment, may become dominant and reinforced over time. Later in life, therapy may promote the strengthening of alternative circuits related to trust, emotional regulation or self-awareness. But the old pathways aren’t necessarily erased. They remain in the background, potentially reactivated under stress. The idea that the brain is ‘rewired’ to function in a healthier way may offer hope, but it oversimplifies the reality. We build new trails, but the old ones don’t necessarily disappear.

Experience is a major force in shaping the nervous system. But, as the neuroscientists Bryan Kolb and Ian Whishaw argue in their widely cited review of brain plasticity, it always works in context. Over a lifetime, experience ‘alters the synaptic organisation of the brain’, but the brain’s response is also shaped by age, hormones, trophic factors (support proteins), stress, and illness or injury. And because the neocortex can ‘modify its function throughout one’s lifetime’, the same experience can leave different traces in different bodies, at different ages. Kolb and Whishaw capture the broader principle in a line worth keeping: ‘experience can modify brain structure long after brain development is complete’, and those physical changes are widely thought to be part of how memories are stored. In other words, plasticity is conditional, uneven and shaped by circumstance, not wishful thinking.

The same review paper makes a critical observation based on careful studies of rats recovering from injury: the evidence suggests that what looks like recovery at first glance is often the brain finding a workaround. In their words, ‘much of what appears … to be recovery is actually a compensatory substitution of new movements for lost movements.’ In plain terms, the brain is often building a detour, not restoring the same old route.

The fact that neurons can expand their reach means that, if some of them die, others may broaden their territory to make up for lost processing. In general, the more connections a neuron has, the more it can shape behaviour.

Beyond this, a feedback loop seems to be at work. There is evidence that the environment can change which genes are switched on in the adult brain. One likely route runs through neural activity shaped by experience. Novel experience causes neurons to fire in new patterns; and those neurons in turn can trigger gene programmes that support dendritic and synaptic growth – structural changes that can, over time, shift behaviour. Some of these genes are known to be associated with learning and memory; others are linked to age-related memory deficits. So enrichment can certainly support the brain.

Examples of neuroplasticity abound. During my neurology residency, one of my teachers, a highly specialised neuro-ophthalmologist, demonstrated the adaptability of the brain in a dramatic way. He recreated an informal experiment on himself by wearing glasses that flipped his visual field upside down. At first, he was disoriented. But within weeks, his brain recalibrated, and he was able to function normally in his environment. Even more remarkable was the re-adaptation that occurred when he removed the glasses; his world once again appeared inverted, and it took additional time for his perception to return to baseline. He later recreated another experiment by repeating the process with another set of glasses that reversed left and right, and he reported that this lateral inversion was far more difficult for the brain to compensate for than the vertical one. The experiment demonstrates how the brain adapts by recalibration rather than by restoring an original state, treating the altered input as normal over time.

The ability to alter speech is another testament to the plasticity of the brain. One fascinating distinction in neuroscience is that speech and singing use different neural pathways. For example, some well-known singers stutter when speaking but not when singing. Elvis Presley famously had a stutter that disappeared when he sang. Ed Sheeran also stuttered as a child and tried many techniques to overcome it. Nothing worked, until, at age nine, he began rapping along to an Eminem album. Through repetition, his fluency improved. Similarly, the country singer Mel Tillis spoke with a stutter but sang fluidly. In each case, fluency emerges not through repair but through recruitment of alternative circuits.

There’s also the curious case of singers who speak with strong accents but who lose them when they sing. Examples include Ozzy Osbourne, Adele, Ed Sheeran, ABBA and Freddie Mercury. Singing slows speech, elongates vowels and reduces accent markers. Many artists adopt American accents in songs due to the US roots of pop and rock music. The shift again reflects a change in network engagement rather than a permanent alteration of underlying language systems.

Across the lifespan, brains that are challenged tend to retain greater flexibility

This difference between speech and song forms the basis of a therapeutic approach known as melodic intonation therapy (MIT). It’s often used with patients suffering from non-fluent aphasia after a stroke, that is, those who can’t speak due to damage in the brain’s speech centres. In MIT, patients sing familiar childhood songs deeply encoded in emotional memory. Remarkably, they are often able to sing words and phrases they cannot otherwise speak. With repetition, speech improves. This is because singing activates preserved right-brain circuits, creating alternative pathways that gradually strengthen the brain’s overall language network. The gain comes through detour and reinforcement, not restoration of the damaged pathway.

Recent research suggests that addiction may, in part, be a wiring issue in the brain. One promising treatment is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a noninvasive therapy that uses powerful magnetic pulses discharged above the skull to activate specific brain regions. Depending on where the stimulation is applied, it can trigger muscle movement or, more significantly, influence behaviour.

Two leading theories for the potential of TMS have emerged. One proposes that addiction stems from insufficient or underactive brain wiring, like that which occurs in stroke patients, and that stimulation reactivates dormant circuits. The other – more consistent with what we see in rehabilitation – suggests that damaged or dysregulated circuits are bypassed by strengthening alternative pathways, effectively rerouting brain activity. This ‘detour’ mechanism has been observed in stroke rehabilitation and may apply to addiction as well. TMS has been used in patients addicted to cocaine, and early evidence suggests that several weeks of treatment may be effective in reducing cravings and use.

While neuroplasticity resists shortcuts, it does respond to sustained engagement. Across the lifespan, brains that are challenged – cognitively, socially, physically – tend to retain greater flexibility than those that are not. This is not because any single activity ‘rewires’ a specific circuit, but because varied, effortful experiences repeatedly recruit overlapping networks: attention, memory, movement, emotion. Learning a new language, for example, activates distributed regions across both hemispheres, linking auditory perception, working memory, and executive control. Playing a musical instrument does something similar, coupling fine motor coordination with timing, prediction, and emotional recall. Over time, these demands encourage structural and functional changes that support what neuroscientists call cognitive reserve: the brain’s ability to compensate when injury or degeneration occurs.

The same principle applies beyond formal learning. Singing engages breath, rhythm, language and affect in ways that ordinary speech does not, which is why it can support recovery in some stroke and Parkinson’s patients. Physical activity – especially aerobic exercise – improves cerebral blood flow and is associated with changes in the volume of the hippocampus, a region critical for turning short-term memory into long-term memory. It’s also one of the few brain regions where new neurons are generated in adulthood. Social interaction recruits emotional and linguistic circuits simultaneously, offering a kind of neural cross-training that solitary exercises cannot. Even seemingly modest skills, such as learning to juggle, have been shown to induce measurable changes in grey matter after weeks of practice. None of these activities function as targeted neural ‘fixes’. Their value lies instead in repetition, novelty and sustained effort – the slow conditions under which plasticity operates. They do not override biology but work with it, nudging the brain toward adaptation rather than transformation.

Given what we know about brain plasticity, the overarching claims of brain rewiring often misrepresent both the pace and the nature of neural change. In his guide Rewire Your Brain: Think Your Way to a Better Life (2010), the psychologist John B Arden declares that our brains are not ‘hardwired’ but rather ‘soft-wired’ by experience, and promises strategies to help readers ‘rewire’ their brains so that they can ‘feel calm and positive’ and ‘enhance’ their relationships. The neurologist Philippe Douyon’s book Neuroplasticity: Your Brain’s Superpower: Change Your Brain and Change Your Life (2019) explores how ‘we can give our brains exactly what they need to adapt, heal, and thrive’. The language varies, but the promise is consistent: targeted practices can reliably produce targeted psychological outcomes.

Then there are the brain-rewiring apps. An apt example is Quit Addiction – Rewire Brain, which is geared toward breaking addictions like smoking, vaping or alcohol by combining habit-tracking, motivation tools and progress-monitoring in order to ‘rewire your brain for lasting change’. Across platforms, the metaphor suggests speed, precision and personal control – qualities that biology itself rarely affords.

And TED Talks can overstate the case. As the neuroscientist Michael Merzenich explained in his presentation in 2004, the brain’s circuitry is not fixed: the adult brain, in fact, retains a ‘lifelong capacity for plasticity’ which ‘is powerfully expressed’. He later described what takes place within the brain:

There are 15 or 20 cortical areas that are changed specifically when you learn a simple skill … It represents the change, in a reliable way, of the responses of tens of millions, possibly hundreds of millions, of neurons in your brain. It represents changes in hundreds of millions, possibly billions, of synaptic connections in your brain.

The science is sound, but its popular reception often strips away the conditions – time, repetition, constraint – under which such change occurs.

To be ‘rewired’ suggests an all-or-nothing overhaul rather than nuanced progression

Merzenich traced this discovery from critical periods in early childhood (when language and vision are calibrated) to adult therapies that retrain neural maps for speech and reading disorders. The key message was simple and striking: plasticity never switches off; it can be accomplished well into adulthood.

More than a decade later, the neuroscientist Don Vaughn took the stage at TEDxUCLA with a more applied vision. In ‘Neurohacking: Rewiring Your Brain’ (2015), he showcased how emerging tools allow people to consciously shape that plasticity. He described patients receiving non-invasive brain stimulation for depression, parents using apps that translate baby cries into visual signals, and volunteers who learned to self-modulate their brain rhythms through neurofeedback. ‘If we can rewire your brain using devices, would it at all be possible to help your brain rewire itself with just your own thoughts?’ The question captures the cultural leap – from biological possibility to personal mastery.

Taken together, Merzenich’s foundational science and Vaughn’s demonstrations underscore why the phrase ‘rewiring the brain’ has become so potent in popular culture: it gestures not only to the metaphorical promise of self-improvement but also to a concrete, testable biology – the brain’s architecture is malleable and, under the right conditions, it can be reshaped. Yet embedded in these slogans are sweeping assumptions about how the brain works, assumptions that are often oversimplified or outright incorrect. One is the idea of rapid transformation: when an app promises that a week of short audio lessons can ‘rewire’ the brain, it compresses the slow, cumulative processes of learning and adaptation into a quick-fix model. Another is that change is total; to be ‘rewired’ suggests an all-or-nothing overhaul rather than nuanced progression, as if old circuitry can be removed and replaced wholesale. A third is precision targeting, where the discourse tacitly promises that specific practices – such as gratitude exercises or productivity hacks – strike exactly the right neural pathways to produce specific psychological outcomes. All three assumptions resonate with our technological imagination; none align with the messy realities of neuroplasticity.

In short, the metaphor is powerful but problematic. It suggests that, no matter where someone begins their process, whether recovering from a head trauma or battling cognitive decline, the brain can snap back to normal. There’s a certain poetry to that idea. A reassurance that we are not static beings and that transformation is possible at any age.

There are contexts where this has value. It can help patients understand that their brains are not static or irreparably broken. It frames recovery as active rather than passive, encouraging participation in therapies that promote healing. Educators have also embraced the metaphor when teaching students. The idea that you can rewire your brain reinforces the possibility of learning and change. In clinical settings, it can reduce shame and fatalism.

However, for stroke survivors, the promise of rewiring can be both inspiring and unrealistic. Some regain remarkable function; others plateau despite intense therapy. In Alzheimer’s, the degenerative nature of the disease limits the brain’s plasticity. In such contexts, rewiring may imply a level of control or optimism that the brain itself does not always permit. Hope matters. But so does honesty.

Metaphors can motivate, but they can also mislead. The notion that someone can rewire their brain through sheer willpower, self-help books or 10 minutes of daily meditation risks turning serious neurological change into a gimmick. While cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and physical rehabilitation have strong evidence supporting their effects on brain function, these changes occur over time and have biological constraints.

The brain is not a circuit board. Changing it is not as simple as swapping a wire or updating software. ‘Rewiring’ implies speed and precision, a single tweak that creates a desired result; it implies that changes in the brain are mechanical and always possible, none of which is guaranteed. The reality of neuroplasticity is far messier: it’s a biological process that is incremental and frustratingly slow. And while science does support the idea that the brain can change, it also reminds us that change comes at a cost. It requires time and effort, and sometimes it ends in failure.

The metaphor turns healing into a moral achievement, and failure into a personal flaw

Here’s where the metaphor of rewiring starts to do damage. It suggests that brain changes are mechanical and under direct conscious control. But in practice, brain changes are nonlinear. Most often they are unconscious and deeply tied to emotion and new behaviour.

One common myth is that a single realisation or decision can ‘rewire’ you. In truth, even profound insights rarely result in lasting neural change unless reinforced by repetition and behaviour. Another is that you can eliminate trauma responses by replacing them. But trauma alters deep, limbic structures that don’t ‘recode’ easily. They adapt, yes, but only slowly and not always completely.

There’s also the misconception that anyone can change anything if they just try hard enough. But not all brains have the same capacity or conditions for change. There’s a dark side to the optimism around brain change. When the metaphor of rewiring is oversold, it can create false expectations. It oversimplifies. And in doing so, it runs the risk of making people feel broken when their transformation isn’t instant or complete.

If rewiring is easy, then why haven’t you fixed your depression? If brain change is automatic with the right programme, then why are you still struggling?

This thinking can be cruel. It ignores several factors – from the social to the environmental to the genetic – that shape and constrain neuroplasticity, many of which are only partially understood. It turns healing into a moral achievement, and failure into a personal flaw. Some therapy models and self-help programmes lean into this pressure, implying that full transformation is just a matter of effort. But science tells a different story: change is possible, yes. But it’s constrained by biology and shaped by context.

I’ve seen patients blame themselves when neuroplasticity didn’t yield a cure. People grasp at therapies that promise to rewire away disease. The language of neuroscience is being used to justify everything from educational policy to digital detox programmes with little regard for the underlying data.

None of this is to say that neuroplasticity doesn’t exist. It does. Stroke recovery, phantom limb sensation, chronic pain syndromes and even language acquisition in adults all bear its fingerprints. What’s needed is precision. Scientists must be careful with their words. Clinicians must draw clearer boundaries between science and metaphor. And the public must be equipped to discern between poetic licence and peer-reviewed truth.

What we really need is a more honest, but still hopeful, view of brain change.

If not ‘rewiring’, then what? Perhaps the better metaphor is not a machine being repaired but a landscape being reshaped. Neuroplasticity resembles erosion and regrowth: some paths deepen, others fade, and change unfolds unevenly over time.

Neuroplasticity is a remarkable capacity. It offers real hope for recovery, adaptation and growth. But it requires patience, structure, repetition and support. It is not a quick fix. It is a lifelong process that demands sustained engagement.

To honour the brain’s ability to change, we need to respect how it actually works. That means moving beyond buzzwords and shortcuts, and toward a language that reflects both the promise and the limits of biology. The brain’s capacity for change is one of the most hopeful discoveries in modern science – but that change comes not through clever metaphors or overnight programmes. It comes through effort, repetition and time. By tempering our metaphors with reality, we can help people pursue transformation with both hope and humility. Language matters. ‘Rewiring the brain’ began as a hopeful metaphor. Let’s not let it become a misleading one.

        Jupiter is slightly smaller and flatter than scientists thought for decades, a new study finds.

Researchers used radio data from the Juno spacecraft to refine measurements of the solar system's largest planet. Although the differences between the current and previous measurements are small, they are improving models of Jupiter's interior and of other gas giants like it outside the solar system, the team reported Feb. 2 in the journal Nature Astronomy.

"Textbooks will need to be updated," study co-author Yohai Kaspi, a planetary scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, said in a statement. "The size of Jupiter hasn't changed, of course, but the way we measure it has."

Until now, scientists' understanding of Jupiter's size and shape have been based on six measurements performed by the Voyager 1 and 2 and Pioneer 10 and 11 missions. Those measurements, which have since been adopted as standard, were performed around 50 years ago using radio beams, according to the statement.

But the Juno mission, which has been gathering data on Jupiter and its moons since it arrived at the gas giant in 2016, has collected much more of this radio data in the past two years. With that additional data, researchers have now refined measurements of Jupiter's size down to about 1,300 feet (400 meters) in each direction.

"Just by knowing the distance to Jupiter and watching how it rotates, it's possible to figure out its size and shape," Kaspi said. "But making really accurate measurements calls for more sophisticated methods."

Bending light

In the new study, the scientists tracked how the radio signals from Juno back to Earth bent as they passed through Jupiter's atmosphere, before cutting out when the planet blocked the signal entirely. Those measurements allowed the team to account for Jupiter's winds, which slightly alter the shape of the gaseous planet. Then, they used that information to make precise calculations of the planet's shape and size.

With the new data, the team calculated that the planet's radius from its pole to its center is 41,534 miles (66,842 km) — 7.5 miles (12 km) smaller than previous measurements. The newly calculated radius at the equator is 44,421 miles (71,488 km) — 2.5 miles (4 km) smaller than previously thought.

"These few kilometers matter," study co-author Eli Galanti, an expert on gas giants at the Weizmann Institute of Science, said in the statement. "Shifting the radius by just a little lets our models of Jupiter's interior fit both the gravity data and atmospheric measurements much better."

The updated measurements will improve our understanding of Jupiter's interior, as well as help scientists interpret data from gas giants beyond the solar system, the researchers wrote in the study.

"This research helps us understand how planets form and evolve," Kaspi said in the statement. "Jupiter was likely the first planet to form in the solar system, and by studying what's happening inside it, we get closer to understanding how the solar system, and planets like ours, came to be."
