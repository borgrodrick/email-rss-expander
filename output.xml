        <hr/>
        When it comes to deciding where to vacation, the usual suspects, like the number of nice hotels, attractions, and places to eat, are important to consider. But it's also vital to understand the basics, too—like the safety of a new place. Thankfully, travel insurance provider Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection recently released its rankings of the safest cities in the world to visit and live in.

For its study, BHTP combed through feedback from more than 1,500 American travelers who ranked cities they had personally visited across multiple safety factors, including crime, terrorism risk, emergency services, health standards, and inclusivity. After crunching all the data, Iceland's capital, Reykjavik, took the top spot for safety from violent crime, ranking ahead of cities like Seoul, Dubai, Honolulu, and Copenhagen.

Reykjavik has earned a global reputation as one of the safest cities to visit and live in, and the latest study reinforces that status. In the capital and throughout Iceland, violent crime is extremely rare, and serious offenses like assault and robbery are far less frequent than in many major urban centers around the world. With a population of roughly 135,000, Reykjavik benefits from its small size, which encourages community connection, high social trust, and a strong social safety net. Many neighborhoods in Reykjavik are also recognized by the safety index provider GeoSure as being uniformly secure.

Strolling through Reykjavik’s compact city center, travelers can explore colorful streets lined with charming cafes, boutique shops, and the unmistakable Hallgrímskirkja church, an Expressionist structure designed to mimic Iceland’s basalt lava flows. Travelers can attend a concert or performance at the waterfront Harpa Concert Hall and Conference Centre, then walk to the nearby Sun Voyager sculpture for scenic views of the bay. Museums, such as the National Museum of Iceland and the Reykjavík Art Museum, offer deep insights into the country's history and culture.

Just outside Reykjavik, travelers have easy access to some of Iceland’s most iconic natural attractions. Popular destinations include the relaxing geothermal pools of the Blue Lagoon and Sky Lagoon, the volcanic landscapes and waterfalls along the Golden Circle route, and massive glaciers like Langjökull and Vatnajökull, Europe’s largest glacier. During the wintertime, travelers can witness the Northern Lights and explore crystal ice caves, while in the warmer months, they can see the Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon and Diamond Beach. Those with more time can comfortably drive the entire Ring Road in about 10 days.

        Over the past month, the Trump administration has deployed thousands of federal immigration agents to the Minneapolis area. On Saturday, Jan. 24, federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Pretti was the third person shot by federal agents in the area in January.

The Department of Homeland Security initially said an agent fired “defensive shots” after Pretti approached officers with a weapon, but video of the incident appears to contradict that claim. DHS said this week that two officers involved were placed on leave. In a press conference on Thursday, border czar Tom Homan said the administration is working on making the operation “safer, more efficient, by the book.” He said that agents will focus on “targeted, strategic enforcement operations” with a “prioritization on public safety threats.”

Our photojournalists Cengiz Yar and Peter DiCampo were on the ground in Minneapolis, covering what they saw in the days before and after Pretti’s death. Read their accounts below.

Cengiz Yar

I arrived in Minneapolis last week to report on the crackdown and how local residents were reacting.

I had packed my medical kit, full face respirator, helmet and a couple tourniquets, essentials for my reporting bag when I make trips to dangerous and potentially violent areas. I also brought layers upon layers of warm clothing, as temperatures were expected to drop to 20 below in the coming days. I knew the ICE raids and the community’s response had been intense across the region, but I wasn’t fully prepared for what I’d end up seeing playing out in the streets.

In my few days in Minnesota, I’ve been witness to countless scenes that remind me of moments I’ve seen during previous trips covering conflicts around the world. I watched heavily armored federal units roll through quiet neighborhoods. In a grocery store parking lot, angry residents screamed at agents, demanding they leave the city. Masked and armed government agents pointed weapons toward me and some protesters during an encounter in the middle of the afternoon. Curious guests in a hotel elevator wondered why I was carrying around a medical pack and gas mask. Local residents thanked me for being there to witness the situation. A drunk man at a hotel bar cursed at me, saying the media was at fault. The wars we’ve carried out as a nation abroad have come home.

On my first day out reporting, I came upon an incident that had been unfolding for over an hour. Late in the afternoon on Thursday, Jan. 22, three construction workers clung to a roof, bracing themselves against the slanted plywood of an unfinished two-story house on the far south side of Minneapolis. Federal agents had massed in the house and in cars on the street, conducting a raid on the construction site. The agents called for the workers to come down. They refused. They stayed on the roof, exposed to the elements in negative 4 degree weather.

I stood outside the house looking up at the men on the roof, wondering how they were surviving in only high-visibility vests and work clothing. Onlookers begged the agents to let them bring the men blankets. They were told to stay out of the building.

Other construction workers milled about the snow-covered site as their co-workers hung on above. Some cursed at the officers. One worker told the men to come down before they freeze to death. “You can at least go to a warm cell,” he shouted. One young, white worker stuck his middle finger in the face of agents idling in their car. “Fuck you,” he screamed as he stomped around the site. A half dozen onlookers had assembled as well, shouting encouragement to the men above and asking the agents for compassion.

The three men remained on the roof as the young, white construction worker argued angrily with the agents for almost an hour.

Finally, as the time approached 5 p.m., the agents left.

Onlookers rushed into the building and brought the men down to wrap them in blankets. “You’re OK now,” they reassured the men. “You did great.”

On Friday, I arrived in South Minneapolis as protesters gathered, shouting, filming and blowing whistles at armored agents in a pickup. After a few minutes, the agents threw tear gas into the small crowd of onlookers and sped away. Gas drifted through the snowy streets, passing cute two-story houses and short, leafless trees. My throat burning, I crouched to the ground, coughing up the irritants behind a snowbank.

I couldn’t have known that less than a day later, in a similar situation, Customs and Border Protection agents would kill a man by shooting him multiple times in the back as they pinned him to the ground. Pretti died while filming agents and trying to help a woman as he was pepper sprayed. In the unfolding chaos in the hours after the shooting, I watched as agents unloaded tear gas on a couple hundred furious protesters who had assembled at the site of the shooting. Heavily armored law enforcement faced off against a crowd of unarmed protesters carrying signs and screaming for justice and retribution.

It was 9:07 a.m. on Saturday morning when I learned that someone had been shot outside Glam Doll Donuts on Nicollet Avenue. It would be hours before I heard the name Alex Pretti and watched the grisly videos of CBP agents shooting him to death. But knowing that Minneapolis was on edge following the death of Renee Good, also killed by federal agents, I grabbed my camera and the warmest clothing I could find. I rushed out of my house. By 9:29 a.m., I was in my car texting a group of fellow photographers “omw.”

Yellow police tape and federal agents lined the scene of the shooting, keeping everyone about a block away in every direction. A small crowd gathered. The first person I recognized wasn’t another journalist, it was my neighbor. “Peter!” she cried, and told me she wasn’t sure what was happening, just that she had also heard about the shooting and wanted to get down there. She sobbed into my arms for a minute, then we parted ways.

More agents gathered. Many wore gas masks. More residents and others ready to protest another killing arrived. A young man stood at the edge of the yellow tape and yelled; an older woman hugged him to try to calm him down. The anger of the crowd was palpable. “ICE agents: Get out of Minneapolis,” they screamed.

I do not have the words to articulate how it feels to watch this unfold in Minneapolis, a city that I have grown to know and love after moving here a few years ago. The journalists who flocked here over the past few weeks are people I have run into while on assignment in hot spots all over the world. Now they were in my home city.

As crowds grew, agents fired tear gas to keep them back. Crowds would then briefly disperse, but some agents would grab and detain people regardless. The crowds reformed quickly, and the cycle of tear gas, detentions and regrouping continued.

After one bout of tear gas, I stumbled away, doubled over and coughing. “Come inside!” I heard someone yell. I looked up and saw a woman opening the door to an apartment building. She wasn’t yelling to me but to two photographers I know. I stumbled toward them, and the three of them saw me, and all extended the invitation: “Come inside!”

I was grateful to be out of the tear gas, and I was grateful to be warm. That day’s high temperature was well below zero; at one point, I looked down and realized frozen condensation had iced my camera dials and buttons in place.

The other two photographers and I made our way to the rooftop and spent the next hour-plus photographing from above. We overlooked the scene of the shooting and could see the FBI examining it and the line of protesters and agents going back and forth in three different directions.

We watched as the federal presence finished at the shooting scene and packed up. They slowly backed out, firing tear gas at protesters who ran at them as they drove away.

We went back down to the street. Protesters gathered at the next block, and a similar scene played out there, this time with city and state police. “Why aren’t you protecting us?” one person yelled at them. Another protestor tried to calm the crowd down, but people were fed up: “Fuck your pacifism,” I heard someone yell.

Tear gas was fired, people dispersed and the police slowly backed out. Eventually, without federal agents and police around, the mood shifted from chaos to something more somber.

As I took a moment to breathe, I realized that the final standoff had taken place right in front of Cheapo Records, where I went record shopping on my birthday a couple years back. And the events of the entire day — the shooting, the protests, the tear gassing — all unfolded on a stretch of Nicollet Avenue called Eat Street, known for having many of the best restaurants in town, with cuisines from all over the world that showcase the city’s diversity. I knew then that walking these streets would never feel the same.

People made their way to the site of Alex Pretti’s death. There was still yellow tape around it, now tied haphazardly around trash cans. A small bloodstain was visible on the pavement.

Quietly, they began to build a memorial.

        After wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park, cougars — that had only regained a foothold a few decades earlier — were able to coexist due to their diets changing and the varied landscape of the park, according to new research.

Run-ins between wolves (Canis lupus) and cougars (Puma concolor, also called mountain lions and pumas) in Yellowstone National Park happen when wolves steal prey from — and sometimes kill — cougars, and this dynamic becomes more harmonious when cougars shift to eating smaller prey, according to a new study published Jan. 26 in the journal PNAS. Successful wolf and cougar coexistence in Yellowstone, the findings suggest, depends more on the diversity of prey and the availability of escape terrain for cougars than it does on the overall abundance of prey.

"Yellowstone is a fascinating system because it's got the full complement of large carnivores and migratory ungulates that North America used to have," Chris Wilmers, a wildlife ecologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz who was not involved in the new study, told Live Science. "A lot of these species are coming back –– wolves were reintroduced, mountain lions and grizzly bear numbers have been recovering –– so it's also a system that's in flux. As these populations restore themselves, it's super interesting to look at these species' effects on each other."

Cougar and wolf habitats are increasingly overlapping in the western United States. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, both species were nearly eradicated from the U.S. due primarily to hunting. Cougar populations began to rebound in the 1960s under new protections, and wolf reintroduction began in the 1990s and benefited from expanded legal protection.

Both species are now prevalent throughout the western U.S., but scientists are still working to understand the animals' population dynamics and their impacts on the broader Yellowstone ecosystem.

The new study analyzed nine years of GPS data from collared wolves and cougars, combined with field observations at almost 4,000 sites throughout Yellowstone. The researchers found that wolves occasionally kill cougars, but cougars do not kill wolves.

These findings align with previous work that showed wolves were the more dominant large carnivore in this food web, even though the two species have similar body sizes. Wolves likely dominate because they move in packs, whereas cougars are solitary, which means wolves can run cougars off and steal their prey, said lead study author Wesley Binder, a doctoral student in the Department of Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Sciences at Oregon State University.

"These interactions are very one-sided," Binder told Live Science. "But cougars have the ability to adapt in some ways."

Both cougars' and wolves' diets are changing, according to the new findings: Between 1998 and 2024, elk went from constituting 95% to 64% of wolf diets, and from 80% to 53% of cougar diets, likely because Yellowstone elk (Cervus canadensis) populations are decreasing more broadly.

This decline led to changes in wolf and cougar interactions. "If cougars kill larger prey like elk, that gives wolves more time to find the cougar sitting on that kill," Binder said. "We found that wolves and cougars were six times more likely to interact when cougars killed elk, compared to deer. Deer are less than half the size of elk, so cougars eat them a lot faster, and wolves have a lot less opportunity to discover those kill sites."

Shifting cougar diets from declining elk numbers led to fewer interactions with wolves overall. Instead of elk, cougars began eating smaller prey, like deer. Wolves, they found, started eating more bison.

"It's important to realize that's why the cougars switched, but in doing so, it made them less vulnerable to scavenging and potentially getting killed by wolves," Wilmers said.

The terrain, the findings showed, also shapes the animals' encounters. When surrounded by rugged terrain or trees they can climb, cougars had fewer dangerous encounters with wolves.

Yellowstone's diversity of both prey and landscapes seems to be a sweet spot for wolf-cougar coexistence. Both species' populations are currently stable. "Wolves and cougars prefer different habitat, and Yellowstone has different habitat that suits each of these carnivores," Binder said.

The findings reveal the ideal landscape and prey characteristics for the stable coexistence of two large carnivore species — and how clashes between predators can have a ripple effect on the whole ecosystem.

"We're always trying to understand what the impact is of large carnivores on prey [populations]," Wilmers said, "and what the interactions are between the large carnivores, and how they might combine or cancel out each other's influence on prey. … It's the beginning of unraveling that story between wolves and [cougars]."

        <hr/>
        In the generative AI boom, vibe coding and AI expertise have become in-demand résumé skills. But tech companies are also looking to pay a premium for expertise in people who have a skill that predates AI: the art of communication.

Andreessen Horowitz launched its New Media team last year to help founders learn what they "need to win the narrative battle online." Adobe is looking for an "AI evangelist" to lead the company's "artificial intelligence storytelling." Netflix, a company that sells stories to your living room, recently posted a director of product and technology communications role with a salary range of up to $775,000. Microsoft began publishing a print magazine, Signal, last year, calling it an "antidote to the ephemeral nature of digital." Anthropic tripled the size of its communications team last year, growing to about 80 people and is still hiring five more, each offering salaries of around $200,000 or higher. OpenAI has several open communications jobs boasting salary listings of more than $400,000. The average director of communications in the US makes $106,000, according to Indeed.

Three years after the mainstream adoption of ChatGPT, results have been mixed: Within tech firms, vibe coding is nixing the need for entry-level software developers, while some workers across industries are foisting rapidly generated, verbose, and sloppy AI nonsense onto their colleagues, leading to wasted time and a breakdown of trust. Even Sam Altman said last year that people have started to affect a sort of AI accent when speaking, and now some social platform discourse "feels very fake."

Amid all chatter about gen AI taking jobs, the ease with which gen AI spits out content has ironically revved the demand for human communicators.

Because AI generates so much content, "you would think that actually the job of the comms person or the storyteller would be fewer and farther between," says Gab Ferree, founder of Off the Record, a community for communications professionals, and former vice president of global communications at Bumble. But that's not what's happening. Tech companies are hiring writers, editors, chief communications officers who work closely with CEOs, and so-called "storytellers." The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the percentage of job postings on LinkedIn mentioning "storyteller" doubled between 2024 to 2025.

In a competitive industry where startups fight to survive and Big Tech rivals campaign for market dominance, a good story is a selling point. One theory behind the push, Ferree says, is "there's just so much garbage out there that people want to pay a premium for someone who can claim that they can cut through the noise."

The trend of storytelling and lucrative comms jobs has been "percolating for a while," says Jenna Birch, founder of SISU, a communications consultancy for startups and VCs. As Silicon Valley's influence ballooned over the past two decades, tech companies could offer staggering salaries just as more newspapers were bleeding more and more writers. Content marketing became popular, and building a company's brand on social media and surfacing blog posts in Google search results became essential.

More recently, the role of the comms pro has continued to expand, as they have to understand large language models, company blogs, how to craft a larger narrative to set a company apart from competitors, and how to write in a CEO's voice on LinkedIn and Substack. The number of chief communication officer roles that encompass not just traditional comms duties but also take on another responsibility, like marketing or or human resources, at Fortune 1000 companies grew from 90 in 2019 to 169 in 2024, according to a report from the Observatory on Corporate Reputation. The median pay for a CCO at a Fortune 500 company is now between $400,000 and $450,000, a $50,000 jump from 2023, according to a survey from consultant firm Korn Ferry.

If everyone's a writer, then nobody's a writer, and I think it's very evident right now.Cristin Culver, founder of Common Thread Communications

As the job changes and demand for narrative communications and storytellers rises, the number of communications experts able to work under rapidly evolving conditions and with a wide remit may be small, comms experts tell me, leading companies to offer hefty compensation packages in war for the best talent. A similar trend is unfolding among the few people who are AI experts, driving tech companies to offer astounding salaries to poach top talent from rival firms. While not of the same nine-figure caliber, in their own right, creatives are becoming "the high value person in tech now," Birch says.

For much of the tech boom, that high-value person was a software developer. Universities and coding bootcamps rushed to fill employment gaps and train up the next generation of tech workers. Young people were told coding would be a path to a lucrative, stable career. As of 2023, the most recent year the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released data for, computer science recent graduates faced an unemployment rate of 6.1%, while communications majors' unemployment rate sat at 4.5%. The number of open job posts for software engineers dropped by more than 60,000 between 2023 and late 2025, according to data from CompTIA, a nonprofit trade association for the US IT industry. The best defense against automation, some argue, will be a liberal arts degree.

Words might be easy to generate with AI, but good writing isn't ready for automation.

"If everyone's a writer, then nobody's a writer, and I think it's very evident right now," says Cristin Culver, founder of communications firm Common Thread Communications. LinkedIn is full of posts written by AI in a similar style that makes eyes glaze over as they scroll. "I think AI is both aiding and making storytelling much harder," Culver says. "Ironically in this era of AI, some of the most poignant storytelling belongs to the people who've realized that everything is sloppified and they've pivoted to very tactical storytelling."

Anthropic has been leaning heavily into that tactical, and tactile, storytelling. In the fall, the company created a pop-up Claude Cafe in New York to position the chatbot as a thinking and problem solving partner, marketing the space as one for showing up in person, connecting, and being surrounded by books and magazines over screens (although the company has also destroyed and scanned millions of books to train Claude, which a judge ruled last year was not a copyright violation).

"Claude is definitely a prominent team member for everyone, but comms people are sort of like BS detectors," Sasha de Marigny previously told Axios last May, months before she was promoted from head of communications to become the company's first CCO. "Critical thinking is still a huge comparative advantage for humans. I'm looking for excellent strategists — people who understand the new world order and know how to develop holistic plans to cut through to the audiences we care about." Anthropic declined to speak more about its comms strategy for this story.

"It's a golden age for people who really enjoy the craft of communications," says Steve Clayton, CCO of Cisco, who formerly worked at Microsoft and launched the company's print publication. When he first tried ChatGPT, Clayton says he worried his career was done. He's since become an AI optimist, seeing gen AI as a tool and opportunity for communicators and so-called storytellers to stand out with content that feels authentic content projects that strike people. "In an environment where nobody's sat at their desk today saying: God, I wish I had more email, or I wish I had more websites I could visit, or I wish I had more podcasts — the challenge is, how do you create something that is worthy of people's time and worthy of their attention?"

Jobs where brands build out their own newsrooms are "going to be one of the last places where AI is replacing writers," says Noah Greenberg, CEO of Stacker, a content distribution company. Unlike traditional media, which relies on clicks, advertising, and subscription to make money off a constant stream of content, "when brands are investing in the strategy, they're not thinking about: 'Do I break even on an individual piece of content?' They're thinking about: 'How do I create five or 10 really incredible stories every month that get our story out there, that prove and turn us into the authority as a respected party in this space?""

As with coding and image generation, LLMs are likely to keep getting better. LLMs may write with more voice or sound more human eventually. But the chatbots and agents don't think. They generate creative content without cycling through a creative process. A 2025 Columbia Business School study found LLMs have a bias for "Option A," preferring the first choice when given a list and asked to pick. For people working in comms, AI might be more friend than initially imagined foe — at least because it makes their work stand out.

This article answers some frequently asked questions about Recommended stories on the Firefox New Tab page on both computers and mobile devices.

Recommended stories on the Firefox New Tab page is a feature currently available in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, France, Spain, and India. We’re working to bring it to other countries.

Why am I seeing these stories, from these publishers, on the Firefox New Tab page?

Firefox’s recommendations elevate content that is worthy of your time and attention – that informs, inspires, entertains, and offers new and unique perspectives. Firefox’s recommendations team works with custom machine learning algorithms to surface the most compelling content from around the web, drawing on a wide array of sources with a track record of trustworthy and accurate coverage.

Are these stories on the New Tab page personalized to me?

For the most part, no. Most recommendations on your New Tab page come from a general list of the best stories on the web. But Firefox is actively working on ways to deliver personalized recommendations in a way that vigorously protects users’ privacy. Importantly, Mozilla never receives a copy of your browser history. When personalization does occur, recommendations rely on a process of story sorting and filtering that happens locally in your personal copy of Firefox.

What information is collected when I interact with Recommended stories?

By default, when stories recommended by Firefox are displayed on your New Tab page, we collect information about how many times they appear and how many times they are clicked. You can learn more about how to manage how your data is collected.

Firefox partners with select publishers and brands to deliver high-quality sponsored content and advertisements to our users. This content will always be clearly marked, and you have control over whether it is shown on your New Tab page.

If you prefer to not see a sponsored story on your New Tab page, you can easily dismiss it by selecting the three-dot button next to the recommendations and clicking Dismiss. You can also permanently opt-out of viewing sponsored stories by following the instructions here.

Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us. Except for an aggregated total count of impressions and clicks that a particular item receives, sponsors do not receive any additional data from Mozilla. We do not collect personally identifying data through these interactions, nor do we share it with our sponsors.

Many stories remain relevant beyond 24 hours. Firefox elevates content that’s interesting and relevant regardless of publication date.

I don’t want to see recommended stories on my New Tab page. How do I turn this off?

To hide recommended stories in Firefox on your computer or mobile device, follow these instructions:

If you don’t like a piece of content that was recommended, you can dismiss it from the menu that appears when you select the three-dot button at the top right corner of the tile.

Why does an article recommended to me have a paywall?

What is a paywall?

A paywall is a way to restrict access to certain online content. Some publishers use it to encourage readers to log in or subscribe to be able to view their articles.

Websites can implement two kinds of paywalls:

A soft paywall that lets readers view a limited number of articles before prompting them to log in or subscribe.

A hard paywall that blocks viewing any content without subscribing first.

Why might I see an article with a Paywall in Recommended stories?

From time to time, you may encounter a Recommended story that is from a site that utilizes paywalls. Our policy is to not recommend content that’s behind hard paywalls, but we will include recommendations from sites that use soft paywalls.

Our aim is to recommend the best of the web by connecting readers with stories that are worthy of their time and attention, and this policy means that we can connect these stories with the widest possible audience.

If you hit a paywall when trying to view a story, it’s likely you have already hit your maximum number of stories allotted by that publisher. At that point, you can choose to subscribe to the publisher if you’d like, or move on to the next article.

What if I want to opt out of data collection?

Firefox collects technical and usage data by default, but you can turn this off at any time.

In the Menu bar at the top of the screen, click Firefox and select Settings (or Preferences, in some cases).Click the menu button and select Settings.

Select the Privacy & Security panel.

Scroll down to the Firefox Data Collection and Use section.

Uncheck the box next to Allow Firefox to send technical and interaction data to Mozilla.

To learn more about what data Mozilla receives and how it's used, see Mozilla's Firefox Privacy Notice.

        <hr/>
        We’ve all been there: It’s 6 a.m. and the very last thing you want to do is get out of bed for that way-too-early HIIT class you already paid for. Or, if you’re a remote worker like me, you know you really should go on that jog you planned your entire day around…but also, what if you just didn’t? So. Tempting.

It’s embarrassingly easy to put off that thing you know you should do—but why? As Janelle S. Peifer, PhD, a licensed clinical psychologist and assistant professor at the University of Richmond told me, we humans like short-cuts and habits that minimize the cognitive, physical, and emotional load we’re exposed to in our daily lives. In other words, we’re kinda lazy. Plus, certain activities can bring up uncertainty, stress, and even feel like threats to our self-esteem, she tells SELF.

I get it. The urge to bail can be intense—even if you know, deep-down, that said activity is good for you and may very well better your life. As Dr. Peifer told me, your brain likes to play games with you—but there are some powerful tricks you can use to outsmart that instinct to flake so you don’t wind up regretting ditching your plans. Here are a few to try.

Validate your feelings.

Step one: Acknowledge that the task you’re avoiding is challenging. Oftentimes, we tell ourselves we’re weak or flawed by not following through with something that’s relatively simple. “You might think, ‘Why can’t I do this, I said I was going to do it,’” says Dr. Peifer.

But negative emotions like punishment and guilt cause you to procrastinate and further reduce the chance you’ll follow through. For example, if every time you don’t go to the gym you beat yourself up about it, you’ll stop even trying to motivate yourself to do it. On the flip side, when you feel positive and capable about your to-dos, you’ll naturally feel less resistance and therefore be less likely to drag your feet.

So, normalize the struggle—recognize that the task, whether it be getting off your couch to meet up with friends or scheduling those doctor appointments you’re past due for, is going to take some work and effort. When you take this approach, you’ll feel less like a failure, which will reduce the chances you’ll give up, says Dr. Peifer.

Break down your task into tiny, achievable parts.

People often set intense, lofty goals that are inherently tough to achieve, says Dr. Peifer. Maybe you signed up for a gym membership and enrolled in fitness classes every single night of the week. Or, perhaps, you bought enough ingredients at the grocery store to meal prep five dinners in a row.

Going from zero to 100 is a fool’s errand, says Dr. Peifer, and you’re more likely to stick with your plans when you aim to accomplish small, attainable tasks. Maybe that means you only go to the gym two times a week or cook three nights and let yourself dine out or order in (or graze on whatever you have laying around) the other nights.

Then, when you actually have to walk out the door, focus on the steps you need to take—put on your sneakers, go outside, walk or drive to the grocery store—instead of the monumental cooking sesh you’re about to have, says Claudia Giolitti-Wright, MA, LMFT, the founder and clinical director of Psychotherapy for Young Women.

Humans are way more likely to complete realistic tasks than goals or activities that are much broader, harder, or complex, says Dr. Peifer. This is why I opt for 20-minute Peloton rides instead of 45- or 60-minute sessions on my busier (or lazier) days—they simply feel more attainable. And, guess what, I still feel fantastic after!

Again, this brings us back to that idea of positive reinforcement: If you feel proud or accomplished when you complete your plans, you’re more likely to follow through next time. “You’re getting intermittent reinforcements that are like gas in the tank,” Dr. Peifer says.

Focus on the process, not the outcomes.

It's easy to reduce a workout or other to-do to just that: a to-do that you need to check off so that you can say you got it done. But focusing on all of the tiny positive things you'll get out of the process can actually be more motivating. “Avoidance often gets worse when the goal is outcome-based,” says Giolitti-Wright.

So, rather than going into something focusing on what you need to do or what the end result will be, try to be present and focus on what you’ll get out of the journey. Take a Peloton ride, for example. Focusing on how you have to exert yourself for 45 minutes can make it feel daunting (and kind of like a chore), but when you think about what the ride will actually be like—bopping along to fun music, high-fiving random strangers on the leaderboard, laughing at whatever-the-hell Cody Rigsby says next—you’ll probably find your finger backing away from the cancel button.

Get an accountability buddy.

Another quick hack: Team up with a pal who can hold you accountable. “We often try to do things individualistically,” says Dr. Peifer, “but feeling committed to and supported by other people can be really helpful.”

Research shows teaming up with others boosts follow through. Essentially, whether you’re planning to work out, read, eat, whatever, you’ll feel happier and more motivated when you do it with a buddy. So, text a friend and ask them to give you a brief pep talk. Or invite them to that networking happy hour you’ve got penciled in (but are dreading). It’s far easier to commit when you’re in it together. And if it’s as bad as you feared it would be, you’ll at least have someone to commiserate with.

Allow yourself to take a raincheck.

Finally, and I am a huge advocate for this tip, know when it’s time to pivot. Sometimes that inner voice telling you to take it easy is onto something. Perhaps said activity is simply not a good fit for you—maybe you’re not feeling so jazzed about Pilates because you’re actually more of a long walk outdoors kinda person (me!). That’s important intel!

There’s also a chance you need to slow down. If you’re tired, hungry, sick, or in pain, listen to those cues—your body’s trying to tell you something. Reassess your goal and either give yourself permission to scale back to something that feels way more attainable (like we talked about above) or reschedule it for later in the week. Rest is also productive.

I’ll leave you with one final tip: If you wind up postponing, be nice to yourself. Tell yourself you’re maxed out and will reset and try again soon, or that you aren’t quitting, but rather, pacing yourself, says Giolitti-Wright. “If you bail, bail kindly, don’t turn it into a character attack,” she says.

        <hr/>
        The viral virtual assistant OpenClaw—formerly known as Moltbot, and before that Clawdbot—is a symbol of a broader revolution underway that could fundamentally alter how the internet functions. Instead of a place primarily inhabited by humans, the web may very soon be dominated by autonomous AI bots.

A new report measuring bot activity on the web, as well as related data shared with WIRED by the internet infrastructure company Akamai, shows that AI bots already account for a meaningful share of web traffic. The findings also shed light on an increasingly sophisticated arms race unfolding as bots deploy clever tactics to bypass website defenses meant to keep them out.

“The majority of the internet is going to be bot traffic in the future,” says Toshit Pangrahi, cofounder and CEO of TollBit, a company that tracks web-scraping activity and published the new report. “It’s not just a copyright problem, there is a new visitor emerging on the internet.”

Most big websites try to limit what content bots can scrape and feed to AI systems for training purposes. (WIRED’s parent company, Condé Nast, as well as other publishers, are currently suing several AI companies over alleged copyright infringement related to AI training.)

But another kind of AI-related website scraping is now on the rise as well. Many chatbots and other AI tools can now retrieve real-time information from the web and use it to augment and improve their outputs. This might include up-to-the-minute product prices, movie theater schedules, or summaries of the latest news.

According to the data from Akamai, training-related bot traffic has been rising steadily since last July. Meanwhile, global activity from bots fetching web content for AI agents is also on the upswing.

“AI is changing the web as we know it,” Robert Blumofe, Akamai’s chief technology officer, tells WIRED “The ensuing arms race will determine the future look, feel, and functionality of the web, as well as the basics of doing business.”

In the fourth quarter of 2025, TollBit estimates that an average of one out of every 50 visits to its customers’ websites was from an AI scraping bot. In the first three months of 2025, that figure was only one out of every 200. The company says that in the fourth quarter, more than 13 percent of bot requests were bypassing robots.txt, a file that some websites use to indicate which pages bots are supposed to avoid. TollBit says the share of AI bots disregarding robots.txt increased 400 percent from the second quarter to the fourth quarter of last year.

TollBit also reported a 336 percent increase in the number of websites making attempts to block AI bots over the past year. Pangrahi says that scraping techniques are getting more sophisticated as sites try to assert control over how bots access their content. Some bots disguise themselves by making their traffic appear like it’s coming from a normal web browser or send requests designed to mimic how humans normally interact with websites. TollBit's study notes that the behavior of some AI agents is now almost indistinguishable from human web traffic.

TollBit markets tools that website owners can use to charge AI scrapers for accessing their content. Other firms, including Cloudflare, offer similar tools. “Anyone who relies on human web traffic—starting with publishers, but basically everyone—is going to be impacted,” Pangrahi says. “There needs to be a faster way to have that machine-to-machine, programmatic exchange of value.”

WIRED attempted to contact 15 AI scraping companies cited in the TollBit report for comment. The majority did not respond or could not be reached. Several said that their AI systems aim to respect technical boundaries that websites put in place to limit scraping, but they noted such guardrails can often be complex and difficult to follow.

Or Lenchner, the CEO of Bright Data, one of the world’s largest web-scraping firms, says that his company’s bots do not collect nonpublic information. Bright Data was previously sued by Meta and X for allegedly improperly scraping content from their platforms. (Meta later dropped its suit, and a federal judge in California dismissed the case brought by X.)

Karolis Stasiulevičiu, a spokesperson for another cited company, ScrapingBee, told WIRED: “ScrapingBee operates on one of the internet’s core principles: that the open web is meant to be accessible. Public web pages are, by design, readable by both humans and machines.”

Oxylabs, another scraping firm, said in an unsigned statement that its bots don’t “access to content behind logins, paywalls, or authentication. We require customers to use our services only for accessing publicly available information, and we enforce compliance standards throughout our platform.”

Oxylabs added that there are many legitimate reasons for firms to scrape web content, including for cybersecurity purposes and to conduct investigative journalism. The company also says that the countermeasures some websites use do not discriminate between different use cases. “The reality is that many modern anti-bot systems don't distinguish well between malicious traffic and legitimate automated access,” Oxylabs says.

In addition to causing headaches for publishers, the web-scraping wars are creating new business opportunities. TollBit's report found more than 40 companies that are now marketing bots that can collect web content for AI training or other purposes. The rise of AI-powered search engines, as well as tools like OpenClaw, are likely helping drive up demand for these services.

Some firms promise to help companies surface content for AI agents rather than try to block them, a strategy known as generative engine optimization, or GEO. “We're essentially seeing the rise of a new marketing channel,” says Uri Gafni, chief business officer of Brandlight, a company that optimizes content so that it appears prominently in AI tools.

“This will only intensify in 2026, and we're going to see this rollout kind of as a full-on marketing channel, with search, ads, media, and commerce converging,” Gafni says.

        <hr/>
        In September 2025, Nvidia and OpenAI announced a letter of intent for Nvidia to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI’s AI infrastructure. At the time, the companies said they expected to finalize details “in the coming weeks.” Five months later, no deal has closed, Nvidia’s CEO now says the $100 billion figure was “never a commitment,” and Reuters reports that OpenAI has been quietly seeking alternatives to Nvidia chips since last year.

Reuters also wrote that OpenAI is unsatisfied with the speed of some Nvidia chips for inference tasks, citing eight sources familiar with the matter. Inference is the process by which a trained AI model generates responses to user queries. According to the report, the issue became apparent in OpenAI’s Codex, an AI code-generation tool. OpenAI staff reportedly attributed some of Codex’s performance limitations to Nvidia’s GPU-based hardware.

After the Reuters story published and Nvidia’s stock price took a dive, Nvidia and OpenAI have tried to smooth things over publicly. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X: “We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world. We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time. I don’t get where all this insanity is coming from.”

What happened to the $100 billion?

The September announcement described a wildly ambitious plan: 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI, requiring power output equal to roughly 10 nuclear reactors. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC at the time that the project would match Nvidia’s total GPU shipments for the year. “This is a giant project,” Huang said.

But the deal was always a letter of intent, not a binding contract. And in recent weeks, Huang has been walking back the number. On Saturday, he told reporters in Taiwan that the $100 billion was “never a commitment.” He said OpenAI had invited Nvidia to invest “up to” that amount and that Nvidia would “invest one step at a time.”

“We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI,” Huang said. “Sam is closing the round, and we will absolutely be involved. We will invest a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we’ve ever made.” But when asked if it would be $100 billion, Huang replied, “No, no, nothing like that.”

A Wall Street Journal report on Friday said Nvidia insiders had expressed doubts about the transaction and that Huang had privately criticized what he described as a lack of discipline in OpenAI’s business approach. The Journal also reported that Huang had expressed concern about the competition OpenAI faces from Google and Anthropic. Huang called those claims “nonsense.”

Nvidia shares fell about 1.1 percent on Monday following the reports. Sarah Kunst, managing director at Cleo Capital, told CNBC that the back-and-forth was unusual. “One of the things I did notice about Jensen Huang is that there wasn’t a strong ‘It will be $100 billion.’ It was, ‘It will be big. It will be our biggest investment ever.’ And so I do think there are some question marks there.”

In September, Bryn Talkington, managing partner at Requisite Capital Management, noted the circular nature of such investments to CNBC. “Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia,” Talkington said. “I feel like this is going to be very virtuous for Jensen.”

Tech critic Ed Zitron has been critical of Nvidia’s circular investments for some time, which touch dozens of tech companies, including major players and startups. They are also all Nvidia customers.

“NVIDIA seeds companies and gives them the guaranteed contracts necessary to raise debt to buy GPUs from NVIDIA,” Zitron wrote on Bluesky last September, “even though these companies are horribly unprofitable and will eventually die from a lack of any real demand.”

Chips from other places

Outside of sourcing GPUs from Nvidia, OpenAI has reportedly discussed working with startups Cerebras and Groq, both of which build chips designed to reduce inference latency. But in December, Nvidia struck a $20 billion licensing deal with Groq, which Reuters sources say ended OpenAI’s talks with Groq. Nvidia hired Groq’s founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, along with other senior leaders, as part of the arrangement.

In January, OpenAI announced a $10 billion deal with Cerebras instead, adding 750 megawatts of computing capacity for faster inference through 2028. Sachin Katti, who joined OpenAI from Intel in November to lead compute infrastructure, said the partnership adds “a dedicated low-latency inference solution” to OpenAI’s platform.

But OpenAI has clearly been hedging its bets. Beyond the Cerebras deal, the company struck an agreement with AMD in October for 6 gigawatts of GPUs and announced plans with Broadcom to develop a custom AI chip to wean itself off of Nvidia dependence. When those chips will be ready, however, is currently unknown.

        <hr/>
        MADRID (AP) — Spain plans to ban social media access for children under 16, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Tuesday, in a move designed to shield young people from the harms of online content.

Sánchez chided the world’s biggest tech companies in a speech at a Dubai summit, saying they allow illegal content such as child sex abuse and nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images to proliferate on their platforms. He said that governments also needed to “stop turning a blind eye.”

“Today, our children are exposed to a space they were never meant to navigate alone,” Sánchez said. “We will no longer accept that.”

Spain joins a growing number of countries, including Australia and France, which have taken or are considering measures to restrict minors’ access to social media.

In January, France approved a bill banning social media for children under 15, paving the way for the measure to take effect at the start of the next school year in September. The bill would also ban the use of mobile phones in high schools.

Australia has started implementing the world’s first social media ban for under-16s, after its government passed a measure that holds platforms including TikTok, Twitch, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for failing to prevent children from having accounts.

Denmark has introduced similar legislation to ban access to social media for users under 15, while the U.K. said last month it would consider banning young teenagers from social media, as it tightens laws designed to protect children from harmful content and excessive screen time.

Sánchez said that Spain would require social media companies to enforce the ban with age verification systems, “not just check boxes, but real barriers that work.”

Many social media apps require users to be at least 13, though enforcement varies. Users are often asked to declare their own age.

Spain’s ban will be added to an already existing measure centered on digital protections for minors that is being debated by parliament, a government spokesperson said. Sánchez said that could happen as early as next week.

It’s unclear if Sánchez’s left-wing coalition will get the approval needed in Parliament, where his government lacks a majority. A spokesperson for the far-right Vox party said the Sánchez government’s measure was aimed at “making sure that no one criticizes them,” while the main opposition party — the center-right Popular Party — said it had proposed similar restrictions last year, seemingly offering its support.

Social media companies Meta — which owns Facebook and Instagram — and X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

But Elon Musk, X’s billionaire owner and the world’s richest man, wrote that “Sánchez is the true fascist totalitarian,” in a post referencing the Spanish leader’s speech at the World Governments Summit in the United Arab Emirates.

In his address, Sánchez also said that Spain had joined five other European countries in what the Spanish leader dubbed a “coalition of the digitally willing” to coordinate the regulation of social media platforms at a multinational level.

Additionally, Spain would make it a criminal offense to manipulate algorithms to amplify illegal content and would hold tech executives liable for failing to take down criminal content from their platforms, he said.

“No more pretending that technology is neutral,” Sánchez said.

Both measures would require parliamentary approval to change Spanish law, a government spokesperson said.

        <hr/>
        A Taiwanese national who built a crypto-fueled dark web narcotics empire worth over $105 million while moonlighting as a cybercrime trainer for Caribbean police has been sentenced to three decades in federal prison.

Rui-Siang Lin received the 30-year sentence for operating Incognito Market under the pseudonym "Pharoah," overseeing a digital drug bazaar that sold more than one ton of narcotics, including fentanyl-laced pills, to over 400,000 buyers worldwide between October 2020 and March 2024, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.

U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon handed down the sentence following Lin's guilty plea to conspiracy to distribute narcotics, money laundering, and selling adulterated medication.

<span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display:inline-block;width:0px;overflow:hidden;line-height:0" class="mce_SELRES_start"> </span>

“Today’s sentence puts traffickers on notice: you cannot hide in the shadows of the Internet,” U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in the statement. “And our larger message is simple: the internet, ‘decentralization,’ ‘blockchain’—any technology—is not a license to operate a narcotics distribution business.”

Incognito Market worked as a crypto-enabled dark web platform accessible via Tor that enabled more than 1,800 vendors to carry out over 640,000 narcotics transactions, including cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, MDMA, and misbranded prescription drugs.

To enable anonymous crypto transactions, Incognito Market maintained its own internal "bank" where users deposited crypto into personal accounts.

After each transaction, crypto was transferred from the buyer's to the seller's account, minus the 5% commission that funded operations and generated over $6 million in profits for Lin.

While managing Incognito from St. Lucia, Lin conducted a four-day training session for local police on "Cybercrime and Cryptocurrency," later bragging about it on Facebook.

In January 2022, Lin introduced a policy explicitly allowing opiate sales on the platform, which led to fraudulent prescription drug listings, and a 27-year-old Arkansas resident later died after taking purported oxycodone purchased on Incognito Market that was laced with fentanyl.

Lin shuttered the platform in 2024 after stealing at least $1 million from users' deposits in the Incognito Bank.

He then attempted to extort vendors and buyers on the site while threatening to publish their transaction histories and crypto addresses unless they paid him.

Homeland Security Investigations arrested Lin at John F. Kennedy International Airport in May 2024, following a multi-agency investigation involving the FBI, DEA, FDA, and NYPD.

Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at TRM Labs, told Decrypt the sentence "reflects how courts now view large darkweb markets as core infrastructure of the illicit underbelly of the crypto ecosystem, not fringe platforms."

"While it falls short of the life-level outcomes in cases like Silk Road and AlphaBay, pardons aside, it still sends a clear message that running these platforms carries consequences comparable to major organized crime," Redbord added.

In addition to the 30-year prison term, Lin was sentenced to five years of supervised release and ordered to forfeit $105 million.

        Adobe plans to shut down Adobe Animate, a 2D animation software used to create vector-based animations for websites, games, and cartoons.

As of March 1, the company will stop accepting new sign-ups. Existing users can continue using the software beyond that date, but technical support will end on March 1, 2027. To avoid losing work, users must download files before that technical support ends.

Enterprise customers have an extended timeframe for downloads; they’ll be able to export their files through March 1, 2029. Adobe has begun notifying users about the changes via email.

"Animate has been a product that has existed for over 25 years and has served its purpose well for creating, nurturing, and developing the animation ecosystem," Adobe says on a support page. "As technologies evolve, new platforms and paradigms emerge that better serve the needs of the users."

Adobe recommends that customers with a Creative Cloud Pro plan use Adobe After Effects for complex keyframe animation or Adobe Express for simpler animation effects on photos, videos, text, and shapes.

Animate users, including creators behind animation series Chikn Nuggit, have expressed their displeasure on social media. “Adobe has been legendary at destroying great products,” writes one user. “This is legit gonna ruin my life,” writes another.

        <hr/>
        Samsung’s 2025 was filled with new foldables, an ultra-thin new form factor and the launch of Google's XR platform. After making some announcements at CES 2026, the company is expected to host its first Galaxy Unpacked of the year in February to introduce the Galaxy S26 lineup. Official invites have yet to be shared, but the date is widely expected to be near the end of the month, probably on February 25 But as usual, we know a lot about what’s expected when Samsung does hold its next event.

Whenever it does happen, Engadget will be covering Galaxy Unpacked live, and we'll most likely have hands-on coverage of Samsung's new smartphones soon after they're announced. While we wait for an official invite, here's everything we expect Samsung will introduce at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026.

What is Unpacked 2026 taking place?

But first, when is Unpacked going to happen? A recent image shared by leakster Evan Blass indicated Unpacked should be taking place on “February 25 2026.” Blass has a long history of credible leaks, which means this date is all but confirmed, and the main questions remaining would be — what time and in what timezone? We’re still waiting on Samsung for the official details, which should include answers to those questions.

Galaxy S26, S26+ and S26 Ultra

Samsung's restrained approach to updating its phones will likely continue with the Galaxy S26. Based on leaked images of the new lineup, the company is not expected to radically reinvent the look of the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ or Galaxy S26 Ultra, and instead will stick with a similar design to what it used on the Galaxy S25. The phones will have a flat front screen and frame, with rounded corners and cameras housed in a vertical pill-shaped plateau on the back. Unlike Apple's move from the iPhone 16 Pro to the iPhone 17 Pro, the biggest difference here will likely be internal components like the screens, chips and camera sensors Samsung uses.

Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip is expected to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site Yonhap News reports Samsung's relatively new Exynos 2600 chip could be used in some phones in the lineup depending on the region, a strategy Samsung has deployed in the past. Either way the new phones should be more performant than the previous generation, and in the case of the models with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, particularly good at on-device AI processing.

One notable difference between the Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S25 could be the phone's screen. The new phone will reportedly feature a 6.3-inch FHD+ display according to specs shared by leaker Ice Universe, which makes it ever so slightly larger than the 6.2-inch display used on the Galaxy S25. The S26 will also allegedly come with 12GB of RAM, either 256GB or 512GB of storage and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery. Samsung isn't changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it'll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.

The difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. According to Android Headlines, the new phone's cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish. Samsung may also switch back to using an aluminum frame on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, after using titanium frames on both the Galaxy S24 and S25 Ultras. Most importantly, to make the phone actually support Qi2 rather than only technically work with the standard when a case is attached, rumors suggest Samsung will remove the S Pen digitizer layer in the phone and adopt a new method for accepting stylus input. It's not clear what that new method will actually be, but it could let the Galaxy S26 Ultra more easily work with Qi2 accessories without losing its stylus.

Android Headlines also recently shared what appear to be full image renders of the S26 series, and they generally line up with what has already been rumored, leaked and reported so far. If these pictures are accurate, they give us a clearer look at the camera bump and two color variants of the S26 Ultra.

Fans of magnets may continue to be disappointed by Samsung if the latest rumors are accurate. Despite the launch of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard adding support for convenient magnetic alignment years ago, Samsung has yet to bring that feature to its phones. Though the S-series have the higher speed charging rates that the spec enables, Nieuwemobiel.nl is reporting that, due to images it received of cases with magnetic rings, the S26 series likely won’t have built-in magnets. Samsung has made these cases to add the magnetic capability to its S-series in the past, and the existence of the images of these accessories lends weight to the idea that the company will continue this approach.

Galaxy Buds 4

Samsung released the Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro in 2024, with a major redesign that brought them much more in line with Apple's AirPods. The Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro Samsung is rumored to be announcing soon won't necessarily change that, though they will feature a more compact case and less angular stems, according to leaked images from the Samsung Tips app.

Support for head gestures to accept and decline calls, a feature Apple includes on the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4, is also rumored to work on both versions of the new Galaxy Buds. SamMobile reports the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro may also ship with a new Ultra Wideband chip that will make them easier to find with Google's Find Hub network.

Galaxy Z Trifold

Samsung announced the Galaxy Z TriFold in late 2025 without firm details of when the new smartphone-that-folds-into-a-tablet would be available in North America. That info came on January 27, when the company announced the TriFold would be available in the US on January 30, for a whopping $2,900. Considering we’ve already seen the device in person at CES 2026 and people are most likely to have had a chance to look at, if not buy the foldable for themselves by the time Unpacked rolls around, we don’t expect Samsung to spend too much time dwelling on it, if at all.

Galaxy S26 Edge

When the Galaxy S25 Edge was announced in 2025, it seemed possible that Samsung could replace its "Plus" smartphone with a unique form factor, just like Apple has opted to do with the iPhone Air. There have been conflicting reports on the matter, but it seems like Samsung will not be doing that with the Galaxy S26 Edge.

Instead, the smartphone will reportedly remain another option, much like foldables are for customers not swayed by Samsung's traditional smartphones. The Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to feature a slightly different design than last year's model, according to Android Headlines, with a large rectangular camera plateau that's reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones, and the raised oval Apple used on the iPhone Air. Beyond that, the phone is also expected to be ever so slightly thinner at 5.5mm than the 5.8mm Galaxy S25 Edge.

Bixby and other AI features

Samsung already acts as a first place Google can show off new AI features for Android, but the company is reportedly exploring other AI partnerships, too. In June 2025, Bloomberg reported that Samsung was nearing a deal with Perplexity to integrate its AI-powered search engine across OneUI and its homegrown mobile browser. Perplexity already has a deal with Motorola on its Razr phones, so the only thing that would make a deal with Samsung unusual is the close relationship the company already has with Google.

The company also accidentally announced a new version of its Bixby AI assistant, which will likely also be integrated with Perplexity and could serve as an alternative to Google Gemini. Both a new Bixby and a deeper integration with Perplexity seem like natural new software features to show off at Galaxy Unpacked.

        <hr/>
        With Xcode 26.3, Apple is adding support for agentic coding, allowing developers to use tools like Anthropic's Claude Agent and OpenAI's Codex right in Xcode for app creation.

Agentic coding will allow Xcode to complete more complex app development tasks autonomously. Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI models have been available for use in Xcode since Apple added intelligence features in Xcode 26, but until now, AI was limited and was not able to take action on its own. That will change with the option to use an AI coding assistant.

AI models can access more of Xcode's features to work toward a project goal, and Apple worked directly with Anthropic and OpenAI to configure their agents for use in Xcode. Agents can create new files, examine the structure of a project in Xcode, build a project directly and run tests, take image snapshots to double-check work, and access full Apple developer documentation that has been designed for AI agents.

Adding an agent to Xcode can be done with a single click in the Xcode settings, with agents able to be updated automatically as AI companies release updates. Developers will need to set up an Anthropic or OpenAI account to use those coding tools in Xcode, paying fees based on API usage.

Apple says that it aimed to ensure that Claude Agent and Codex run efficiently, with reduced token usage. It is simple to swap between agents in the same project, giving developers the flexibility to choose the agent best suited for a particular task.

While Apple worked with OpenAI and Anthropic for Xcode integration, the Xcode 26.3 features can be used with any agent or tool that uses the open standard Model Context Protocol. Apple is releasing documentation so that developers can configure and connect MCP agents to Xcode.

Using natural language commands, developers are able to instruct AI agents to complete a project, such as adding a new feature to an app. Xcode then works with the agent to break down the instructions into small tasks, and the agent is able to work on its own from there. Here's how the process works:

A developer asks an integrated agent to add a new feature to an app.

The agent looks at the current project to see how it's organized.

The agent checks all relevant documentation, looking at code snippets, code samples, and the latest APIs.

The agent begins working on the project, adding code as it goes.

The agent builds the project, then uses Xcode to verify its work.

If there are errors or warnings, the agent continues to work until all issues are addressed. It is able to access build logs and revise until a project is perfect.

The agent wraps up by providing a summary of everything that happened so developers have a clear view of the implementation.

In the sidebar of a project, developers can follow along with what the agent is doing using the transcript, and can click to see where code is added to keep track of what the agent is doing. At any point, developers can go back to before an agent or model made a modification, so there are options to undo unwanted results or try out multiple options for introducing a new feature.

Apple says that agentic coding will allow developers to simplify workflows, make changes quicker, and bring new ideas to life. Apple also sees it as a learning tool that provides developers with the opportunity to learn new ways to build something or to implement an API in an app.

"At Apple, our goal is to make tools that put industry-leading technologies directly in developers' hands so they can build the very best apps," said Susan Prescott, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. "Agentic coding supercharges productivity and creativity, streamlining the development workflow so developers can focus on innovation."

The release candidate of Xcode 26.3 is available for developers as of today, and a launch will likely follow in the next week or so.

        <hr/>
        This February, the Super Bowl turns 60.

Before Super Bowl LX gets underway at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., it’s worth reflecting on where the game has been and how it’s grown since the inaugural Super Bowl, then known as the AFL-NFL World Championship Game, took place at the LA Memorial Coliseum in January 1967.

Back then, Vince Lombardi and Hank Stram roamed the sidelines, a pair of future Hall of Fame coaches representing not only their own teams but also the leagues—the NFL and the AFL, respectively.

Today, the Super Bowl is an American holiday, consistently topping television ratings among all programs for the year. It has become more than a game, but a celebration of Americana, a date everyone circles on their calendar, whether it’s to watch football, commercials, the halftime show or simply to gather with friends.

But it wasn’t always that way. The game has grown slowly over the years, exploding into the showstopper it is now. And that’s due to great football, but more importantly, the moments impossible to forget for those who witnessed them.

To that point, Sports Illustrated put together a blue-ribbon panel to vote on the top 60 moments in Super Bowl history. In an effort to get a precise list, all panelists (listed below) selected from a list of more than 100 moments and ranked their personal choices from 1 to 60. Once all the lists were compiled, we had our master list, which you’ll see below.

And we start with the opening play of the only Super Bowl ever played outdoors in a cold-weather city.

60. Super Bowl XLVIII: The Seahawks score a safety on the opening play

The Broncos were favored by 2.5 points. They received the opening kickoff. Then, on the first play from scrimmage, Super Bowl XLVIII began to unfurl.

With Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning adjusting the call at the line, center Manuel Ramírez launched the snap over Manning’s head and into the end zone. Running back Knowshon Moreno fell on the ball and was touched down by Seahawks defensive end Cliff Avril, resulting in only one of nine safeties in Super Bowl history.

The moment was the start of a Seattle onslaught, as the Seahawks charged to a stunning 43–8 victory at MetLife Stadium.

59. Super Bowl LVI: Matthew Stafford makes the perfect throw to Cooper Kupp

For years, Matthew Stafford wasted away in Detroit, spending 12 seasons on a Lions team often out of the playoff race by Thanksgiving. In his first year with the Rams, though, Stafford had his chance to shine.

In the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium, Stafford and Los Angeles had the ball trailing 20–16 with 3:07 remaining, facing second-and-7 at the Bengals’ 46-yard line. Stafford then unleashed the throw that would define his career, launching a no-look strike to receiver Cooper Kupp down the seam for a 22-yard gain.

Ultimately, Stafford found Kupp in the end zone to cap the drive, giving the Rams a 23–20 lead which held up in the final moments.

58. Super Bowl XXXVII: The Buccaneers score three defensive TDs in rout of Raiders

Super Bowl XXXVII was a classic contrast. The Raiders with their top-ranked offense. The Buccaneers sporting their top-ranked defense.

On Super Sunday, it was Tampa Bay that emerged with the best unit on the field. Under former Raiders coach Jon Gruden, then in his first year with the Buccaneers, the NFC champions dismantled MVP quarterback Rich Gannon. Gannon threw five interceptions and was sacked five times, with three of his picks being returned for scores.

In the third quarter, corner Dwight Smith went 44 yards with a theft, putting Tampa Bay up 34–3. In the fourth, All-Pro linebacker Derrick Brooks did the exact same, before Smith added a second pick-six to end the scoring.

It was the first Super Bowl victory for the Buccaneers after coming into the league in 1976.

57. Super Bowl I: Opening kickoff

On Jan. 15, 1967, America changed. The Super Bowl was born in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

That day, the National Football League’s Packers were looking for their second consecutive world title, taking on the Chiefs of the upstart American Football League. Green Bay was, predictably, a heavy favorite under Hall of Fame coach Vince Lombardi, coming into the game laying 14 points.

On a sunshine-bleached 54-degree day, Chiefs kicker Fletcher Smith sent the opening kickoff spinning into the air, and it was returned for 20 yards by Packers corner Herb Adderley.

Green Bay proved itself the superior team, winning 35–10 behind Bart Starr, who threw for 250 yards and a pair of touchdowns.

56. Super Bowl XXXI: Brett Favre hits Andre Rison for TD, rips off helmet and celebrates

After 29 seasons of wandering in the abyss, the Packers finally reached the Super Bowl once again.

This time, they didn’t have Vince Lombardi standing on their sideline, but were chasing the trophy bearing his name. To win it, Green Bay needed to beat the Patriots and coach Bill Parcells at the Louisiana Superdome.

On the Packers’ first offensive drive of the evening, Green Bay faced second-and-9 at its own 46-yard line. MVP quarterback Brett Favre took a deep drop and launched a bomb for receiver Andre Rison, who secured the ball and raced 54 yards for a touchdown.

In celebration, Favre ripped off his helmet and smiled wide, running with his headgear raised over himself. It was a symbol of the night, as the Packers went on to a 35–21 victory.

55. Super Bowl XLI: Prince playing the halftime show in a downpour

Super Bowl XLI wasn’t a great game. The most memorable part of the outcome from a historical perspective was Peyton Manning finally winning it all, giving him security from being the best quarterback to never win a championship.

Arguably, the most entertaining part of the night was when the Colts and Bears were in the locker room, seeking refuge from the downpour that enveloped Miami Gardens. While the teams were inside, Prince came onto the halftime show stage and gave a stirring performance, including such hits as “Purple Rain” and “Let’s Go Crazy.”

While the show only lasted a few seconds more than 12 minutes, it remains one of the most iconic performances we’ve seen on the biggest stage North American sports has to offer.

54. Super Bowl XXX: Larry Brown grabs two INTs en route to MVP award

It was supposed to be a mismatch. The AFC’s Steelers taking on the NFC’s Cowboys, a team looking to win its third Super Bowl in four years.

Instead, the game turned out to be competitive. Pittsburgh hung around and trailed by three points with the ball midway through the fourth quarter. However, the game swung when Steelers quarterback Neil O’Donnell dropped back and threw directly to Cowboys corner Larry Brown, who intercepted the wayward pass and raced to the Pittsburgh 6-yard line. Two plays later, Dallas running back Emmitt Smith ran in for a touchdown to ice the contest.

For Brown, it was his second interception of the game, having snatched one earlier off O’Donnell in the third quarter. Brown’s performance earned him a five-year, $12.5 million deal from the Raiders that offseason, a massive sum in 1996.

53. Super Bowl XV: Rod Martin nabs three interceptions off Ron Jaworski

Coming into the 1980 season, the Raiders were expected to be an also-ran. Instead, Oakland entered the playoffs as a wild-card team, then beat the Oilers, Browns and Chargers before taking on the Eagles in New Orleans for the title.

While quarterback Jim Plunkett was terrific with 261 yards and three touchdown passes, it was Rod Martin who stole the show. Martin, an eventual All-Pro linebacker in his fourth year, intercepted Eagles quarterback Ron Jaworski three times to help Oakland earn a 27–10 upset victory.

In his 12-year career, Martin had 14 regular-season interceptions. But in Super Bowl XV, the fourth-year linebacker picked off Jaworski on the opening drive, and then again in the third and fourth quarters. To this day, Martin is the only player with three interceptions in a Super Bowl.

52. Super Bowl V: John Mackey catches tipped ball for 75-yard TD

In Super Bowl history, there has never been a more blunder-filled game than the fifth edition.

In January 1971, the Colts and Cowboys got together in a game marked by desperation. Baltimore was attempting to erase its stunning Super Bowl III loss, while Dallas was trying to shed the label of Next Year’s champion. The result was a game with 11 combined turnovers.

Yet the best and longest play of the day came in the second quarter. On third-and-10 from the Baltimore 25-yard line, Hall of Fame quarterback Johnny Unitas dropped back and threw up the seam, with the ball being deflected twice. It ended up in the hands of fellow Hall of Famer, tight end John Mackey, who raced 75 yards for a touchdown.

Ultimately, the Colts won 16–13 on a 32-yard Jim O’Brien field goal in the dying seconds.

51. Super Bowl LIV: Tyreek Hill and Patrick Mahomes hook up for Jet Chip Wasp

The Chiefs’ dynasty almost never was. In their first Super Bowl appearance of the Patrick Mahomes era, Kansas City trailed San Francisco 20–10 with less than eight minutes remaining and faced third-and-15.

Then, Mahomes took a 12-step drop and heaved the ball down the left side with Tyreek Hill settling underneath the pass for a 44-yard gain. Four plays later, Mahomes found Travis Kelce in the end zone, touching off a 21-point onslaught to win 31–20, beating the 49ers in the Super Bowl for the first of two times.

Mahomes’s throw to Hill became etched in Super Bowl lore by the play name of Jet Chip Wasp, something Mahomes asked offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy to call in the moment. Without it, Kansas City likely has more Super Bowl losses than wins.

50. Super Bowl XIII: Lynn Swann makes leaping catch for TD

The NFL in the 1970s was defined by the Cowboys and Steelers. The two teams combined to win six titles in the decade, while facing each other in a pair of Super Bowls.

While both matchups were filled with Hall of Famers on both sides of the ball, no player is more synonymous with Pittsburgh’s pair of triumphs over America’s Team than Lynn Swann.

In Super Bowl XIII, the Steelers held a 21–17 lead going into the fourth quarter before running back Franco Harris rumbled in for a 22-yard touchdown. After the following kickoff was fumbled away, the Steelers regained possession, and on the first play, threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to a soaring Swann, leaping over the Dallas secondary to essentially put the game away.

49. Super Bowl LII: Brandon Graham strips Tom Brady to seal the deal

Going into Super Bowl LII, the prevailing belief was that Tom Brady would outduel backup quarterback Nick Foles. On the surface, he did.

Brady put up an unfathomable stat line of 505 passing yards and three touchdowns, helping New England to 33 points. Yet it was the play Brady couldn’t make that ended up defining the end of the 2017 season.

Trailing 38–33 with 2:16 remaining, the Patriots had second-and-2 from the Patriots’ 33-yard line. Brady dropped back and was stripped by defensive end Brandon Graham, and the fumble was recovered by Derek Barnett.

From there, the Eagles added a 46-yard field goal with 1:10 remaining, icing the franchise’s first Super Bowl victory.

48. Super Bowl IV: 65 Toss Power Trap

The Chiefs were expected to be a speed bump. The Vikings, favored by 12 points, entered Tulane Stadium with a 12–2 record and a defense allowing 9.5 points per game.

Yet in Super Bowl IV, Kansas City dominated the Purple Gang. The Chiefs got out to an early 9–0 lead on the strength of three Jan Stenerud field goals before recovering a fumble on a kickoff return. On third down from the 5-yard line, Kansas City coach Hank Stram called 65 Toss Power Trap, a play designed for running back Mike Garrett to take an inside handoff and find space off the left side of the offensive line.

Upon the snap, Garrett ran behind the pulling block of right guard Mo Moorman, going in untouched for a touchdown and 16–0, second-quarter lead.

The Chiefs eventually won 23–7, giving the AFL its second consecutive Super Bowl title.

47. Super Bowl XVI: Dan Bunz makes huge stop on Niners’ goal-line stand

Very few Super Bowls have been as unique as the one produced by the 1981 season. Neither the 49ers nor Bengals had made the previous postseason, and neither was expected to make any significant headway in ’81.

Yet both ended up at the Pontiac Silverdome in January. In Super Bowl XVI, the Niners raced out to a 20–0 halftime lead before Cincinnati scored a third-quarter touchdown and then had a second-and-goal at the 1-yard line.

After a Pete Johnson run was stuffed, MVP quarterback Ken Anderson threw to Charles Alexander on a flare pass inside the 1-yard line. What appeared to be a sure-fire touchdown was thwarted by linebacker Dan Bunz, who made the tackle short of the end zone. On fourth down, San Francisco once again stuffed an inside Johnson run, helping the 49ers preserve a 26–20 victory and their first Super Bowl title.

46. Super Bowl XLVII: The lights go out in the Superdome

The Ravens were cruising to a blowout victory over the 49ers for their second Super Bowl win in franchise history. Then, the power went out in New Orleans.

Due to a massive power failure, the Mercedes-Benz Superdome went dark, causing a 34-minute delay during the third quarter while workers worked to fix the issue. The stoppage gave San Francisco time to calibrate a new game plan, helping the Niners get back into the game before ultimately falling short, 34–31.

While the outage ultimately didn’t shape the outcome of the game, it provided drama in a contest that was lacking any until the stadium went dark.

45. Super Bowl XXXI: Desmond Howard goes the distance on kick return

Howard’s career had been wholly underwhelming after winning the Heisman Trophy in 1991 with the Michigan Wolverines.

The fourth pick in 1992 to Washington, Howard became a bust in the nation’s capital before bouncing to the expansion Jaguars in ’95. But in ’96, Howard signed a one-year deal with the Packers and finally had his moment in the pros.

In Super Bowl XXXI, Green Bay led the Patriots 27–21 in the third quarter. New England kicked off to Howard, who promptly raced a Super Bowl-record 99 yards for the touchdown, making the game 35–21 and finishing off the scoring.

It was also the capstone for Howard’s special year as a returner, in which he scored five return touchdowns, including two in the playoffs.

44. Super Bowl XLIV: Tracy Porter’s pick-six wins it for Saints

Entering the Super Bowl as 4.5-point underdogs to the Colts, the Saints were fighting hard but trailing 17–16 to Indianapolis heading into the fourth quarter.

In the final 15 minutes, Drew Brees led the Saints on a 59-yard touchdown drive, capped off by Jeremy Shockey’s 2-yard scoring grab. Still, leading by seven points with less than four minutes remaining, Peyton Manning had Indianapolis at the New Orleans’ 31-yard line facing third-and-5.

Trying a quick throw to All-Pro receiver Reggie Wayne, Manning’s pass was jumped and picked off by corner Tracy Porter, who ran 74 yards to a championship-clinching score, giving the Saints their first and only title in franchise history.

43. Super Bowl XLI: Devin Hester starts the Super Bowl with a bang

Tony Dungy knew better. For the two weeks leading up to Super Bowl XLI, the coach of the favored Colts told the special teams to kick away from Devin Hester at all costs.

Then, the morning of the game, a sermon from the team pastor spoke of not living in your fears. Dungy heard the words and told his coordinator to kick to Hester. The Colts wouldn’t live in their fears. Then, kicker Adam Vinatieri sent the ball away amidst a sea of flashbulbs going off. And then Hester went the distance. A 92-yard kick return on the opening play.

Unfortunately for the Bears, Hester’s moment also convinced Dungy to stay away from the only returner ever enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Indianapolis ultimately rallied and won 29–17, giving the Colts their first title since relocating from Baltimore in 1984.

42. Super Bowl XI: Willie Brown returns INT for TD

For the better part of a decade, the Raiders were a great team that could never win a big game. In 1976, that finally changed.

Oakland has reached either the AFC title game or Super Bowl in seven of nine seasons before going 13–1 and rolling into Super Bowl XI for a date with the NFC’s Vikings. The game was never close, with the Raiders leading 16–0 at halftime. Trailing 26–7 in the fourth quarter, Minnesota quarterback Fran Tarkenton threw an out-breaking route to the right side.

Tarkenton’s pass was picked off by future Hall of Fame corner Willie Brown, who raced 75 yards for a touchdown. Brown’s play was immortalized by NFL Films, which for decades has used the close-up footage of Brown’s face as he ran stoically with the play of a lifetime.

41. Super Bowl XXII: Washington scores 35 points in second quarter

Super Bowl XXII is a historic day in sports history. For the first time in NFL history, a Black man was the starting quarterback in the Super Bowl, as Doug Williams led an underdog Washington squad against counterpart John Elway and the AFC’s Broncos.

Early on, it appeared Denver would avenge its Super Bowl defeat from the previous year. The Broncos took a 10–0 lead entering the second quarter, only to watch Washington put on a display still unmatched in Super Bowl history.

Williams threw four touchdown passes while Timmy Smith rushed for a 58-yard score as Washington put up 35 unanswered points in the quarter, en route to a 42–10 victory. All told, Williams won MVP honors with 340 yards and four touchdowns, while Smith ran for a Super Bowl record 204 yards.

40. Super Bowl X: Bradshaw to Swann gives Steelers consecutive titles

Lynn Swann never had 1,000 receiving yards in a season. He only played nine years and was just a three-time Pro Bowler. Yet Swann is one of the more revered receivers of all time, largely because of Super Bowl X.

On that Miami afternoon, Swann caught just four balls but made all of them count. The first two were acrobatic specials over corner Marc Washington. The fourth clinched a Super Bowl and consecutive titles for the Steelers.

In the fourth quarter, and nursing a 15–10 lead, Pittsburgh faced third-and-4 from its own 36 yard line with 3:31 remaining. Quarterback Terry Bradshaw dropped back and launched a bomb to Swann, who outraced Washington and caught the pass before sprinting into the end zone. Bradshaw was knocked out on the play by defensive lineman Larry Cole, but the pass was perfect, and the Steelers had their second title.

39. Super Bowl IV: Otis Taylor shakes loose to clinch another win for AFL

Kansas City wasn’t expected to compete with the Vikings in Super Bowl IV. By halftime, the narrative was far different with the Chiefs holding a 16–0 advantage.

After the break, Minnesota got on the board with a Dave Osborn touchdown run, but the Chiefs had the knockout blow coming. On the following drive, quarterback Len Dawson had Kansas City at the Minnesota 46-yard line with 1:50 remaining in the third quarter. He hit a simple comeback route, which star receiver Otis Taylor took the distance by way of a pair of broken tackles.

For the Chiefs, it meant a world championship, something which had eluded them in Super Bowl I. It was also the last meaningful moment of the American Football League, which ceased to exist at game’s end, with the two leagues merging for the 1970 season.

38. Super Bowl XXIV: Joe Montana throws five touchdown passes to beat Broncos

There have been few Super Bowl performances more overwhelming than Joe Montana’s showcase against the Broncos in Super Bowl XXIV.

With the 49ers looking to repeat as champions and cement themselves as a dynasty, Montana put on a clinic against Denver’s top-ranked defense. The future Hall of Fame quarterback threw for 297 yards and five touchdowns, with all the scoring strikes coming before the midway mark of the third quarter.

Montana spread the ball around, finding Jerry Rice for three touchdowns, and both wideout John Taylor and tight end Brent Jones for one apiece as well. The result was a 55–10 win, still the biggest margin of victory in a Super Bowl.

37. Super Bowl XX: Ditka and Ryan, who hated each other, were both carried off the field

There’s a strong argument that the greatest single-season team of all time is the 1985 Bears. The fact that they were so dominant despite their two main coaches despising each other makes their 15–1 record and romp through the playoffs even more impressive.

​Chicago lost just once before shutting out the Giants and Rams in the NFC playoffs. In Super Bowl XX, the Bears thrashed the wild-card Patriots, beating them 46–10 at the Louisiana Superdome.

At the game’s end, coach Mike Ditka was picked up and carried off the field. Surprisingly, defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan was also carried off, with his charges knowing it was his final game before taking over as head coach in Philadelphia. It’s the only time two coaches were carried off the field together.

36. Super Bowl XXVII: Leon Lett gets chased down by Don Beebe

Sometimes it is the heart of a man, not his stats, that measures a player’s value and enduring impact on the game.

This was certainly the case for Bills receiver Don Beebe in Super Bowl XXVII. Buffalo was aiming to win its first Super Bowl despite making its third consecutive appearance. Unfortunately for the Bills, the game got away due to nine turnovers, and the Cowboys ran up a 52–17 lead late in the fourth quarter.

With 4:56 remaining, Buffalo backup quarterback Frank Reich was stripped of the ball. Dallas defensive tackle Leon Lett picked up the loose football and ran goalward, celebrating a few yards early by lowering the ball Michael Irvin-style towards the turf. Unbeknownst to Lett was that Beebe, running full-speed behind him, had caught up and knocked the ball free inches before Lett crossed the goal line.

Buffalo lost by a whopping margin, but Beebe’s effort gave both him and the Bills some national respect.

35. Super Bowl LVIII: Chiefs win in overtime on TD pass to Mecole Hardman Jr.

The Chiefs became a dynasty in Super Bowl LVIII, doing so in the most dramatic fashion possible.

Kansas City only managed three first-half points but came alive in the second half, tying the 49ers at 19–19 going into overtime. San Francisco won the coin toss and surprisingly elected to receive, taking possession and scoring three points on a 27-yard field goal.

Down three and with the ball, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes engineered a 13-play, 75-yard drive culminating in a 3-yard touchdown pass in the final seconds of the extra session. The win gave Kansas City its third Super Bowl in five years.

34. Super Bowl XXXII: Terrell Davis overcomes migraine with 158 yards, 3 TDs

John Elway had three previous chances to win the Super Bowl and was blown out each time. Then, in his fourth appearance and Denver’s fifth, the Broncos finally broke through on the legs of a man who could barely see.

Suffering from a migraine headache and sustaining blurry vision as a result, Terrell Davis fought through the pain to rush for 157 yards and three touchdowns, while also serving as a decoy in a second-quarter touchdown run by Elway.

On a night where the Broncos were 11-point underdogs to the defending-champion Packers, it was Davis who helped lead Denver to its first Super Bowl win, emerging as 31–24 victors in San Diego.

33. Super Bowl LVII: On one ankle, Patrick Mahomes runs 26 yards to a title

The Chiefs getting to the Super Bowl appeared a formality. At 14–3 and the conference’s top seed, they rolled into the playoffs. Then something else rolled. Patrick Mahomes’s ankle.

Dealing with a high ankle sprain from the divisional round to the end of the Super Bowl, Mahomes put on a legendary performance against the Eagles. Facing a ferocious Philadelphia pass rush, which had 70 sacks that season, Mahomes wasn’t brought down once, and with the game tied 35–35 in the final moments, the future Hall of Famer had his moment.

Facing first-and-10 from the Kansas City 43-yard line with 2:55 left, Mahomes escaped the pocket and hobbled for 26 yards, dashing toward an eventual game-winning field goal by Harrison Butker. For the Chiefs, it was their second Super Bowl win in the current era and the first of back-to-back titles.

32. Super Bowl XIV: John Stallworth catches the game-winning deep ball

The Steelers weren’t supposed to struggle with the Rams. After all, Pittsburgh was a dynasty, winning three of the past five Super Bowls. Los Angeles was 9–7 and starting backup quarterback Vince Ferragamo.

Shockingly, the Rams led 19–17 at the Rose Bowl entering the fourth quarter. Then, with the Steelers facing third-and-8 from their own 27-yard line, quarterback Terry Bradshaw and receiver John Stallworth hooked up for the ultimate game-changer.

Bradshaw went long down the middle for Stallworth, who made a beautiful over-the-shoulder grab to beat corner Rod Perry for the eventual game-winning 73-yard touchdown. Two drives later, Stallworth once again beat Perry for 45 yards, all but sealing a 31–19 Steelers win.

31. Super Bowl XXXIV: Warner finds Bruce for a 73-yard TD in the final two minutes

In the ultimate storybook season, the Rams saw two eventual Hall of Famers author a storybook finish.

After taking a 16–0 lead over the Titans at the Georgia Dome, St. Louis watched as Tennessee tied the game. With the ball at their own 27-yard line and 2:12 remaining in regulation, the Rams called an all-go special with receiver Isaac Bruce streaking down the right side.

As quarterback Kurt Warner dropped to throw, he was hit upon release by defensive end Jevon Kearse. The ball was a bit short, but Bruce made the adjustment and raced past fallen corner Denard Walker for the go-ahead score. The Rams would famously hold on, with Mike Jones tackling Titans receiver Kevin Dyson at the 1-yard line as time ran out.

30. Super Bowl XXI: Phil Simms goes 22/25 in epic performance

The Giants were looking for their first championship since 1956. Thirty years later, quarterback Phil Simms made sure to deliver it.

Against the Broncos, Simms and the favored Giants fell behind 10–9 at halftime before rallying to win 39–20. The quarterback, once benched in 1983 for Scott Brunner, had his finest hour at the Rose Bowl, completing 22-of-25 passes for 268 yards and three touchdowns. Simms’s completion percentage of 88.0% remains a Super Bowl record.

​For the Giants, it was the first of four Super Bowl titles the franchise has won, including another in 1990, when Simms was sidelined by a foot injury.

29. Super Bowl LV: Tom Brady beats Patrick Mahomes for his seventh title

For two decades, the only questions surrounding the Patriots was whether coach Bill Belichick or quarterback Tom Brady was more responsible for their 20-year, two-dynasty run at the top of the NFL mountain.

That question was answered for many in Super Bowl LV, when the underdog Buccaneers took on Patrick Mahomes and the two-loss Chiefs, and thoroughly dominated in a 31–9 win. For Brady, it was his seventh ring while also becoming the second starting quarterback to ever win a Super Bowl with two different franchises.

Meanwhile, it also made the claim of Mahomes being better than Brady a tough one to make. While Mahomes and Brady split their head-to-head matchups at three apiece, Brady won both playoff contests, including Super Bowl LV and the 2018 AFC title game at Arrowhead Stadium.

28. Super Bowl LI: Julian Edelman makes the catch of a lifetime

The Patriots trailed 28–3, looking like a beaten club in Super Bowl LI against the Falcons. Then, New England began to rally, an all-time comeback symbolized by a miracle catch from receiver Julian Edelman.

Trailing 28–20 with under three minutes remaining, Brady threw deep down the middle on first-and-10 for Edelman, only to see the pass broken up. Incredibly, Edelman stuck with the ball, dove, and got his hands underneath it for a key 23-yard completion to the Falcons’ 41-yard line.

After tying the game four plays later, New England won the toss and then won its fifth title in the first overtime game in Super Bowl history on a 2-yard touchdown run from James White.

27. Super Bowl I: Max McGee’s one-handed TD catch

The first Super Bowl wasn’t a big deal nationally. In fact, despite the game being held under sunny skies at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum, only 61,946 attended, even though the stadium had a capacity of 94,000.

Most football fans and experts believed the NFL champion Packers would hammer the AFL representative Chiefs, and they were right: Green Bay won 35–10. Still, there were a few seminal moments during the game, including one of the Super Bowl’s greatest catches to this day.

Midway through the first quarter of a scoreless tie, Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr threw a pass to flanker Max McGee. The pass was well behind McGee, who reached back with his right hand, snagged the ball and raced 37 yards for the first score in Super Bowl history. It was the first of two scores for McGee, who had seven receptions for 138 yards.

26. Super Bowl XIII: Jackie Smith drop

Jackie Smith waited his entire life for this moment. After languishing on the Cardinals for 15 years, the Hall of Fame tight end finally reached the Super Bowl in his first season with the Cowboys.

In the third quarter, trailing 21–14, Dallas quarterback Roger Staubach spotted Smith alone in the middle of the end zone. Staubach delivered a strike … and Smith dropped the ball. The Cowboys then settled for a field goal before allowing the Steelers to score 14 consecutive points, losing 35–31 at the Orange Bowl.

For Smith, the moment not only defined the game but, cruelly, his career. The man caught 480 passes for 7,918 yards and 40 touchdowns during his NFL days, but a singular mistake became the moment for which so many remember him.

25. Super Bowl XX: William Perry scores in dominant Bears win

Walter Payton. Jim McMahon. Mike Ditka and Buddy Ryan. The Super Bowl Shuffle.

All of those men and musical tunes are emblematic of the 1985 Bears, but perhaps nothing warms the memory such as The Fridge. That season, Chicago had rookie defensive tackle William Perry, known by his appliance-motivated moniker due to weighing 335 pounds.

After scoring two touchdowns during the season, Perry was given the chance to carry the ball with the Bears leading the overwhelming Patriots 37–3 in Super Bowl XX. From the 1-yard line, Perry slammed into the New England end zone before authoring a thunderous spike, putting an exclamation point on Chicago’s only Super Bowl victory, coming 46–10 over the Patriots.

24. Super Bowl II: Vince Lombardi gets carried off in final win with Packers

There’s arguably never been a better tenure for a coach than the one Vince Lombardi enjoyed with the Packers.

Taking over Green Bay in 1959 after the Packers had a single win the year prior, Lombardi earned a winning record before earning a championship game appearance in ’60. The following two years saw the Packers win NFL titles before earning two more rings in ’65 and ’66, the latter coming in Super Bowl I.

In the 1967 season, Green Bay won just nine games but survived the NFL playoffs to reach Super Bowl II against the Raiders. That day, the Packers won 33–14 at the Orange Bowl before the team carried Lombardi off the field. It proved his final game with Green Bay as coach before returning to the sidelines with Washington in ’69, before dying of stomach cancer in September 1970.

23. Super Bowl XXV: The national anthem by Whitney Houston

Most Super Bowl moments happen on the field, deciding championships and legacies. But every once in a while, something attached to the game also leaves an indelible mark.

Such was Whitney Houston and her rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” leading up to Super Bowl XXV between the Bills and Giants at Tampa Stadium. As is true in so many cases, the context matters. Not only was Houston’s performance flawless, it also came on the heels of the United States entering the Persian Gulf War.

As Houston sang, fans and players alike shed tears as thousands in the crowd held up small American flags, handed out at the gates before the game. The result is one of the most patriotic moments in sports history, matched by the vocal greatness of Houston.

22. Super Bowl V: Jim O’Brien kicks game-winning FG at the gun

There’s never been an uglier Super Bowl than the fifth edition. How so? There were 11 turnovers between the Cowboys and Colts, with the game played in complete desperation.

Dallas entered the game known as Next Year’s Champions, having reached the NFL playoffs three of the past four seasons without getting to the Super Bowl. Meanwhile, Baltimore had lost to Joe Namath and the Jets in Super Bowl III despite being favored by 18 points.

On this day, the teams traded mistakes and ultimately wound up tied at 13–13 with under two minutes left. Then, the game’s final turnover came when Colts linebacker Mike Curtis intercepted Dallas quarterback Craig Morton, setting up kicker Jim O’Brien with a 32-yard field goal attempt for the win. O’Brien connected with five seconds remaining, giving Baltimore its only Super Bowl victory before the team relocated to Indianapolis in 1984.

21. Super Bowl VII: Garo Yepremian’s gaffe leads to Mike Bass touchdown

The Dolphins were about to have the best symmetry in NFL history. They were leading Washington 14–0, lining up for a Garo Yepremian 42-yard field goal. If Yepremian knocked the ball through, and Miami’s defense could hold in garbage time, the Dolphins would win 17–0 to cap off a 17–0 season.

Instead, chaos ensued. Yepremian’s kick was blocked at the line, only for the diminutive Cyprus native to recover. Then, Yepremian attempted to throw and battled the ball into the air, caught by corner Mike Bass, who raced 49 yards for Washington’s first score.

Luckily for the Dolphins, they warded off Washington’s last-ditch effort on its next and final drive, finishing off the only untied and unbeaten season in modern NFL history.

20. Super Bowl XLVI: Eli Manning finds Mario Manningham for the perfect deep ball

When one thinks of Eli Manning making an incredible throw in the Super Bowl, the mind immediately rushes to David Tyree and his helmet. But in reality, Manning has never made a better throw than the one he launched four years later, locating Mario Manningham for a 38-yard connection down the left sideline.

Trailing 17–15 with under four minutes remaining in regulation, the Giants faced first-and-10 from their own 12-yard line. On the drive’s first play, Manning found Manningham in the smallest of windows, fitting the ball between the cornerback, safety and the sideline.

After review, the play was upheld. Eight plays later, Ahmad Bradshaw backed into the end zone, giving New York a 21–17 lead, which it would hold onto for its fourth Super Bowl victory in franchise history.

19. Super Bowl XXIX: Steve Young breaks record with six TD passes

For years, Steve Young lived in Joe Montana’s shadow. Young took over for an injured Montana in 1991 and ’92, winning MVP honors in the latter season before doing it again in ’94. Still, two NFC championship game defeats to the Cowboys left 49ers fans down on Young, who, unlike Montana, hadn’t added to the Niners’ trophy case.

But in Super Bowl XXIX, all that changed. After defeating Dallas in the NFC title game, the 49ers entered as 19-point favorites over the Chargers. Young then had the day of days, throwing for 325 yards and six touchdowns in a 49–26 romp over the AFC champs.

Young’s effort earned him MVP honors, while his half-dozen scoring strikes remain a Super Bowl record.

18. Super Bowl XLIV: The Saints gamble and win with an onside kick

No team embodied losing more than the Saints for most of their history. Upon entering the NFL as an expansion team in 1967, New Orleans endured 20 consecutive losing seasons and didn’t win a playoff game until the 2000 campaign.

The Saints finally reached their first Super Bowl in 2009, playing the favored Colts in Miami. Trailing 10–6 at halftime, coach Sean Payton called for a surprise onside kick to start the third quarter.

As a result, New Orleans recovered and scored on a 16-yard Pierre Thomas reception, helping the Saints win 31–17 and earn their first, and only, Super Bowl victory.

17. Super Bowl XXXVI: Tom Brady authors his first big comeback

Facing the two-touchdown favorite Rams in the Louisiana Superdome, Tom Brady began his legacy as the greatest quarterback of all time.

While New England’s defense should get the majority of the credit for beating the Greatest Show on Turf, holding them to 17 points, Brady is the one forever remembered for engineering a game-winning drive in the dying seconds.

With 1:21 remaining in a 17–17 tie and New England taking over at its own 17-yard line, famed commentator and Hall of Fame coach John Madden believed the Patriots should play for overtime. Instead, Brady led the Patriots on a 53-yard drive on five completions before Adam Vinatieri began the dynasty with a 48-yard field goal as time expired.

16. Super Bowl VII: Dolphins finish off NFL’s only perfect season

There are 59 Super Bowl champions, but only one is perfect.

On Jan. 14, 1973, Miami met Washington at the LA Memorial Coliseum. The Dolphins entered the game 16–0, having navigated the playoffs with wins over the Browns and Steelers en route to the Super Bowl. Meanwhile, Washington had hammered the Packers and Cowboys, winning by a combined score of 42–6.

Going into the game, Miami was only a one-point favorite, with many believing the Dolphins had feasted on a soft, AFC-heavy schedule. However, Super Bowl VII proved no contest despite a 14–7 final score, with Miami outgaining Washington behind a rushing attack that notched 184 yards, led by Hall of Fame fullback Larry Csonka, who gained 112 yards.

The final play was Miami star defensive end Bill Stanfill sacking quarterback Billy Kilmer, giving the Dolphins their capstone.

15. Super Bowl XXXII: John Elway’s helicopter ride

For years, John Elway and Dan Marino looked to be destined for legendary careers without the ultimate achievement. Both members of the famed 1983 draft class, Elway had reached three Super Bowls to Marino’s lone appearance, but all four games resulted in blowouts.

In Elway’s 15th season, the Broncos made it back once more, this time as 11-point underdogs to the defending champion Packers. With the game in San Diego, Denver and Green Bay went back and forth throughout, leading to the most memorable moment of the evening.

Tied at 17 and facing third-and-6 at the Packers’ 12-yard line, the 37-year-old Elway scrambled right and dove head-first for a first down, clearing linebacker Brian Williams while being simultaneously hit by safety LeRoy Butler and defensive back Mike Pryor. Elway gained eight yards, and Denver scored the go-ahead touchdown two plays later before winning 31–24.

14. Super Bowl XVIII: Marcus Allen goes the distance on a 74-yard jaunt

The Raiders were the standard for much of the 1970s and ’80s alongside the Cowboys, Steelers and 49ers, winning three Super Bowls in eight years between 1976 to ’83.

However, entering Super Bowl XVIII in Tampa, Los Angeles was expected to struggle against Washington, a defending champion who beat the Raiders in the regular season. However, the underdogs destroyed Joe Gibbs’s team, winning 38–9 in one of the most lopsided Super Bowls of all time.

While much of the night was forgettable for anybody not a Silver & Black fan, the game did provide one of the greatest runs in NFL history. Leading 28–9 in the final minute of the third quarter, future Hall of Fame running back Marcus Allen took a handoff, went left, reversed course and galloped across the field, eventually scoring on a brilliant 74-yard carry, giving the Raiders a 35–9 advantage.

13. Super Bowl XXXIV: The Tackle

No Super Bowl has ever had a more dramatic ending in regulation. And few, if ever, entered with a better story.

For the Rams, it was a dream season. They went 13–3 and hosted the first NFL playoff game in St. Louis history behind MVP quarterback Kurt Warner, who threw 40 touchdowns after stocking Hy-Vee groceries only a few years earlier.

Against the Titans, St. Louis built a 16–0 lead before Tennessee tied the game. After a 73-yard touchdown strike to Isaac Bruce from Warner, the Rams led 23–16 with six seconds remaining, and the Titans were at the St. Louis 10-yard line.

On the play, Steve McNair completed a pass to Kevin Dyson, who was tackled by the legs at the 1-yard line by linebacker Mike Jones, preserving the Rams’ first Super Bowl title.

12. Super Bowl XVII: John Riggins breaks 43-yard run to sink Dolphins

In 1982, the NFL was upside down. The league had only a nine-game season due to the players’ strike, and as a result, the playoffs were scrapped in favor of the Super Bowl tournament, allowing 16 of 28 teams to make the postseason.

As a result, Washington and Miami showed up, two teams that had met in the Super Bowl a decade before. In this game, one-loss Washington fell behind multiple times in the first half before drawing to 17–13 in the fourth quarter, facing a fourth-and-1 from the Dolphins’ 43-yard line.

After riding fullback John Riggins and his 444 playoff rushing yards to the Super Bowl, coach Joe Gibbs called I-Left 70 Chip, designed for Riggins to crash through the left side. Riggins did exactly that, breaking a tackle from corner Don McNeal and racing into the end zone for the game-winning touchdown, giving Washington its first Super Bowl win, 27–17.

11. Super Bowl X: Lynn Swann makes two levitating leaps

Lynn Swann is in the Hall of Fame despite having 5,462 career receiving yards. That’s outside the top 250 all-time, behind players such as Cole Beasley, Jabar Gaffney, Jessie Hester and Bobby Joe Conrad.

Yet Swann deserves to be in Canton, solely on his Super Bowl exploits. Swann was at his best in Super Bowl X against the Cowboys, catching only four passes but making three of them all highlight-reel grabs.

While the last one was a 64-yard, championship-sealing touchdown catch, the first two were legendary in their own right. In the first quarter, quarterback Terry Bradshaw aired it out for Swann down the right sideline, with the receiver leaping over corner Mark Washington for a toe-tapping, 32-yard gain. A quarter later, Bradshaw found Swann down the middle for a leaping, juggling 53-yard reception, again beating the beleaguered Washington.

Pittsburgh won 21–17, with Swann totaling 161 yards and a touchdown in the victory.

10. Super Bowl XLIII: Santonio Holmes turns Pittsburgh into Sixburgh

This edition of the Super Bowl wasn’t expected to be a classic. The Steelers entered the game as 6.5-point favorites against the Cardinals, a team that had never played on Super Sunday and was 9–7 in the regular season.

Yet, as the game unfolded, it became one of the most iconic Super Bowls of the era. The Steelers never trailed until the final three minutes, after a 64-yard spectacular catch and run by Larry Fitzgerald, who caught a second-and-10 slant route, beating corner Ike Taylor and taking it the distance to give Arizona a 23–20 lead with 2:47 remaining in regulation.

Still, the Steelers had time. After eight plays, Pittsburgh had moved the ball 72 yards to the Cardinals’ 6-yard line with 48 seconds remaining. On the following snap, quarterback Ben Roethlisberger had ample time in the pocket, surveyed the field and finally fired in the back-right corner of the end zone.

Receiver Santonio Holmes began the play in the right slot and worked inside. Yet with everything covered, the third-year veteran worked back toward the pylon. Despite being smothered by three defensive backs, including Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, Ralph Brown and Aaron Francisco, Holmes located the ball, kept his toes inbounds and maintained control of the ball for a game-winning touchdown, giving Pittsburgh its sixth Super Bowl title.

9. Super Bowl XXII: Doug Williams becomes first Black QB in Super Bowl

The game was a laugher. Washington won 42–10 as 3.5-point underdogs, blowing out the Broncos in the Super Bowl for the second consecutive season.

Yet few games have ever been more important in the sport’s history, primarily because of what was accomplished and represented. In January 1988, the NFL had never had a Black quarterback start or win the Super Bowl. That changed in Super Bowl XXII, when Doug Williams led Washington into battle as the NFC’s champion.

After falling behind 10–0 at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, Williams and his team caught fire in record-setting fashion. Washington scored 35 points in the second quarter, including four touchdown passes by Williams. The onslaught led to a blowout by halftime, along with Williams being named the game’s MVP with a statline of 340 yards and four scores.

Since then, other Black quarterbacks have started and/or won the Super Bowl, including Patrick Mahomes, Jalen Hurts and Russell Wilson, but Williams was the man who broke down barriers and won it all.

8. Super Bowl XLIII: James Harrison goes 100 yards with an INT return

The greatest defensive play in Super Bowl history, according to our panel.

In Super Bowl XLIII, the Steelers raced to a 10–0 lead, threatening to blow out the underdog Cardinals. But Arizona rallied and closed to 10–7 with a first-and-goal at the Pittsburgh 2-yard line with 18 seconds remaining in the first half.

On the play, future Hall of Fame quarterback Kurt Warner had one problem. Arizona was without timeouts, almost guaranteeing a pass. Presnap, the Steelers showed an all-out blitz but ultimately brought five men, with the team’s leading sack artist, outside linebacker James Harrison, faking a rush before dropping into zone coverage. Warner never saw him, fielding the snap in shotgun formation and quickly firing inside to star receiver Anquan Boldin.

Harrison was in a perfect position and snagged the pass at the goal line before racing toward the right sideline, escorted by defensive end Brett Keisel and defensive back Deshea Townsend.

Harrison broke the tackles of Warner and tight end Leonard Pope at the Pittsburgh 40-yard line before avoiding running back Tim Hightower. Finally, Harrison exhaustingly crossed the opposite goal line while being tackled by wideout Larry Fitzgerald. The score is the longest in Super Bowl history and gave Pittsburgh a 17–7 halftime lead before winning 27–23 for the franchise’s second title in four years.

7. Super Bowl XXIII : Joe Montana to John Taylor wins it with 34 seconds left

Trailing 16–13, the 49ers found themselves on their own 8-yard line with 3:10 remaining in regulation. Despite moving the ball at will to the tune of 350 yards leading into the final drive, the offense had accounted for only one touchdown.

Then, in typical Joe Montana fashion, San Francisco began moving. With five short passes and two Roger Craig runs, the 49ers moved to Cincinnati’s 45-yard line, facing second-and-20. From there, Montana found legendary receiver Jerry Rice for 27 yards and a first down. Two plays later, San Francisco faced second-and-2 from the 10-yard line with 39 seconds remaining.

On the play, tight end Brent Jones was supposed to be on the left end of the offensive line. Not hearing the call, the second-year man stayed on the sideline. Receiver John Taylor, who was supposed to be aligned elsewhere, took Jones’s spot and ran a skinny post, beating corner Ray Horton for the eventual game-winning touchdown for San Francisco’s third title in eight years.

The play, ironically, was Taylor’s first catch of the evening, coming in the final game for Niners’ Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh.

6. Super Bowl XXV: Wide Right

Super Bowl XXV took place in Tampa, opening with a patriotic show in the wake of the start of the Gulf War. Thousands waved little American flags as Whitney Houston belted out the national anthem, a rendition so stirring that ESPN made a documentary about it.

That moment was buttressed by the game’s ending, with so many things happening within the near-60 game minutes in between. The Bills entered the contest as a 6.5-point favorite. Still, they couldn’t shake the pesky Giants, who, behind the power running of Ottis Anderson and the genius of defensive coordinator Bill Belichick, staked themselves to a 20–19 lead in the dying minutes.

Buffalo’s hurry-up offense drove into position for the game-winning field goal, setting up Scott Norwood with a 46-yard attempt as seven seconds showed on the clock. Instead of becoming the hero who brought the Bills their first Super Bowl title, Norwood’s kick sailed wide right, setting off a string of four consecutive Super Bowl losses for Buffalo. In contrast, the Giants danced off the field with their second championship in five campaigns.

5. Super Bowl LII: The Philly Special

The Eagles had Nick Foles. The Patriots had Tom Brady and were defending Super Bowl champions. Correctly, Philadelphia decided on a bit of trickery to level the playing field.

Leading 15–12 in the final minute of the first half, the Eagles faced fourth-and-goal at the Patriots’ 1-yard line. Instead of kicking a chip-shot field goal or running the ball, coach Doug Pederson called for running back Corey Clement to take a direct snap before pitching the ball to tight end Trey Burton, who, rolling right, threw a soft pass into the front right corner of the end zone, finding Foles for the touchdown.

Without question, the Philly Special, as it came to be known, is the most iconic trick play in Super Bowl history. It gave Philadelphia a 22–12 lead at halftime in a game the Eagles would eventually win, 41–33.

For the Eagles, it was their first Super Bowl win in franchise history, with Foles not only catching a touchdown but throwing for 373 yards and three others.

4. Super Bowl LI: The Patriots come back from down 28–3 and win in OT

With three minutes remaining in the third quarter of Super Bowl LI, the Falcons led the Patriots 28–3. It wasn’t just a blowout; it was a coronation for an Atlanta team looking to bring a city its first NFL title while also capping Matt Ryan’s MVP campaign.

Instead of a moment to savor, it quickly turned into a nightmare for the Falcons. The Patriots scored on four consecutive drives to end regulation, including three touchdowns and a field goal. Meanwhile, Atlanta fell apart with a turnover deep in its own territory while taking a crushing holding penalty on its penultimate regulation drive, taking the Falcons out of field goal range for what would have been a clinching attempt at 28–20.

The game then went to overtime, a Super Bowl first. There, the Patriots won the toss and moved down the field one more time, with Tom Brady completing five consecutive passes, helping New England set up with first-and-goal at the Atlanta 2-yard line.

From there, James White ran right and barreled over the goal line, giving the Patriots the most memorable comeback in NFL history, winning 34–28 to give Brady and the franchise their fifth championship.

3. Super Bowl III: Joe Namath jogs off the field with No. 1 finger in the air

No single game has ever mattered more in American sports. No player has mattered more to professional football than Joe Namath.

On Jan. 12, 1969, Namath and his American Football League Jets entered Super Bowl III as 18-point underdogs to the NFL’s Colts. After the Packers had easily dispatched the AFL-champion Chiefs and Raiders in the first two Super Bowls, it was all but assumed Baltimore would roll over New York.

Instead, one of sport’s greatest upsets was authored on an overcast afternoon in Miami. The Jets scored the game’s first 16 points and eventually won 16–7 on the backs of five takeaways, while Namath earned MVP honors with 206 passing yards.

At the game’s conclusion, Namath ran off the field amid a sea of reporters, teammates and photographers, raising his right index finger in the air to signify the championship. NFL Films captured the moment and became one of the most iconic images of America’s grandest stage, showcasing the exact frame when the Super Bowl became more than a footnote laced with curiosity.

2. Super Bowl XLII: The Helmet Catch

The Patriots were one defensive stop from immortality. Forget being a champion. New England was attempting to become only the second unbeaten, untied team in modern NFL history, trying to cap a perfect season.

In the way were the 10–6 Giants, a wild-card squad that had pushed the Patriots, but were trailing 14–10 in the final minutes. After narrowly converting a fourth-and-1 on a Brandon Jacobs run, New York faced third-and-5 from its own 44-yard line with 1:15 remaining.

Miraculously, quarterback Eli Manning escaped what appeared to be a sure sack before firing late and across the middle, the ultimate no-no. Yet little-used receiver David Tyree caught the ball and pinned it to his helmet, swinging both the pigskin and his hands inches above the ground while being hit by safety Rodney Harrison. The result was a 32-yard reception and one of the greatest plays in Super Bowl history.

Four snaps later, Manning found Plaxico Burress in the left corner of the end zone with 39 seconds remaining, giving the Giants a 17–14 lead, which they’d never relinquish. While Burress’s touchdown won the game, Tyree’s catch has become synonymous with both Super Bowl XLII and miracle finishes.

1. Super Bowl XLIX: Seattle decided to throw, and Malcolm Butler called game

The game was more than a decade ago. Still, if you talk to some Seahawks defenders, they remain stunned and furious over the call.

Trailing 28–24 after more than 59 minutes of a phenomenal game, the Seahawks drove to New England’s 1-yard line. With the clock ticking down, most expected Patriots coach Bill Belichick to call a timeout. Instead, Belichick held his ground while Seattle got to the line with Russell Wilson in shotgun and star running back Marshawn Lynch to his left.

Lynch, the most powerful back of his era, was universally believed to be getting the ball, as Seattle would pound the ball in with three downs at its disposal. Additionally, Lynch had run for four yards and had 102 on the night.

With 26 seconds remaining and a potential second consecutive title in the offing, Wilson took the snap and fired right, looking for Ricardo Lockette on a pick play. Instead, he found corner Malcolm Butler, who jumped the route and boxed Lockette out for the interception.

The stunning turn of events gave New England its first title in a decade, leaving both the Seahawks and the country in a state of disbelief.

        <hr/>
        Hours after the co-owner of a St. Paul toy store criticized the federal government’s immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities during a national television interview, workers there said a pair of federal agents suddenly showed up to announce an audit of employee records.

In another case, protesters observing Immigration and Customs Enforcement movement said officers called them by name, and even led them back to their own home. To the protesters, the incident felt like a bold attempt to silence dissent.

Since “Operation Metro Surge” began in early December, immigration authorities have arrested some 3,000 people in Minneapolis, St. Paul and surrounding areas. The enforcement blitz has drawn criticism, especially of federal agents from ICE and the Border Patrol violently reacting to protests, including the shooting deaths of U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti. But residents in the Twin Cities and other areas where ICE has been cracking down recently say that some of the retaliation they’ve faced has come without a finger being laid on them.

“We’re talking about subtle transactions of intimidation here,” said Kalfani Ture, a senior fellow at Yale’s Urban Ethnography Project and a former police officer. He said the shootings of Good and Pretti were dramatic shows of force. “Repression doesn’t always operate in the dramatic. It often operates in the mundane.”

In the case of Mischief Toys, ABC News reported that workers at the St. Paul toy store used a 3D printer to make thousands of free whistles for people to alert others of the presence of immigration agents. Co-owner Abigail Adelsheim-Marshall told ABC News that it was a form of nonviolent protest and that demand soared after Good was killed. “Everyone is looking for anything they can do to help their community right now,” she said, adding, “ICE is doing far more to hurt our community than immigrants ever have, and I can’t overstate how much our entire community is being terrorized by ICE right now.”

And then the federal agents came to the store. Department of Homeland Security officials confirmed that it had opened an investigation into the store.

“There is an active HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] investigation involving this business that has nothing to do with this owner’s political views,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Independent.

She went on to call the claims that the investigation was in retaliation for Adelsheim-Marshall’s comments “a flagrant attempt to further demonize our law enforcement officers who are already facing a more than 1,300% increase in assaults against them.”

Mike Cutler spent three decades at the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the predecessor to ICE and other Homeland Security units. Since he retired as a senior special agent, he has been a consultant on immigration enforcement and testified before Congress. Cutler said he doubted there was a retaliatory audit because it would diverge from how the agency operated in the past.

“It seems like a fantasy, because if I had engaged in that kind of activity, I would have been at risk of being suspended, or more likely, losing my job,” said Cutler. “We never, ever, ever even thought of doing something like that.”

In another incident in Minneapolis, hospital officials at Hennepin County Medical Center publicly criticized ICE agents for showing up at a patient’s bedside without a warrant. Two days later, on Jan. 8, federal agents sent hospital administrators a letter announcing a similar audit.

Since then, immigration officers have continued showing up at the hospital, causing some workers to fear that their presence could dissuade people from seeking care and spark a public health crisis.

Several other people who said they set out to observe ICE agents found themselves under surveillance instead.

In early January, the day before an ICE agent shot and killed Good, a St. Paul woman and her husband tried to follow a caravan of ICE officers to see where they were going. The couple told Minnesota Public Radio that ICE agents soon surrounded their vehicle. One of them came up to the car and greeted the woman by her name, suggesting they had used her license plate to identify her.

The couple said that when they continued trying to observe the caravan, it headed to the street where they live. The couple told the radio station that they believed federal agents obtained their address to dissuade them from continuing to observe.

“Following or observing or reporting on federal agencies or federal activities is not a criminal activity — it's protected First Amendment activity,” John Boehler, policy counsel with ACLU of Minnesota, told Minnesota Public Radio.

On Jan. 11 in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota, outside of St. Paul, a man and his wife stayed a few cars behind a car with Florida plates that they thought looked suspicious. When they pulled into the same parking lot as the car, they later told CBS News, two ICE agents got out, knocked on their window, and demanded they roll the window down or get out of their car. When the couple said they refused and threatened to call local police, the agents got back in their car, but then followed the couple.

All another woman had to do was drive past an ICE vehicle for immigration agents to pull her over. They demanded she present immigration paperwork and knocked her phone out of her hand when she tried to record them, Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley told Minnesota’s Sahan Journal.

It turned out the woman didn’t have any immigration paperwork because she is a U.S. citizen. The woman, who Bruley described as a woman of color, was also an off-duty Brooklyn Park police officer, who Bruley said felt forced to disclose that she was an officer after the agents drew their guns on her. A Homeland Security spokesperson told the Sahan Journal in an email that the agency had no record of federal agents having pulled over a police officer.

In response to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Minnesota and others, a U.S. District Court judge ordered federal agents to stop arresting, retaliating against, pepper-spraying and detaining people “engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity.” The judge noted that a variety of federal government conduct during the surge would “chill a person of ordinary firmness from engaging in further protected activity. That conduct includes the drawing and pointing of weapons; the use of pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions; actual and threatened arrest and detainment of protesters and observers; and other intimidation tactics.” In one incident from early December, lead plaintiff Susan Tincher — a U.S. citizen who has lived in Minneapolis for 30 years — claims that agents cut off her wedding ring while shackling her and then held her for hours in a cell before releasing her without charges.

In a Jan. 27 statement from the Department of Homeland Security, the agency said it was in Minneapolis “to protect Minnesotans from criminal illegal aliens and get these criminals out of their neighborhoods.”

“Instead of thanking our law enforcement, sanctuary politicians have repeatedly villainized and dehumanized our law enforcement — even comparing them to the Nazi Gestapo,” the statement said. ”Despite these smears, our law enforcement continue to risk their lives in the face of unprecedented violence and threats against them to get criminal illegal aliens off the streets.”

Reports have surfaced of similar tactics by immigration officers elsewhere.

In the days after Pretti’s killing, a pair of protesters in Maine told The Atlantic that ICE agents showed up at their home after they had attended a protest. “This is a warning,” they said the agents told them. “We know where you live.”

Nicholas Natividad, a New Mexico State University professor in Las Cruces who studies human rights on the southern border, said if U.S. citizens are experiencing this kind of behavior, he couldn’t imagine what migrants are going through in detention facilities outside the public eye.

“This moment doesn’t reveal isolated abuses,” said Natividad. “It reveals a larger structure that produces dehumanizing outcomes through policy, bureaucracy and force, whether at the border or increasingly inland.”

Leonardo Martinez is an organizer with VC Defensa, an immigrant rights advocacy group of volunteers that’s been tracking federal immigration enforcement activity over the past year in Ventura County, California. He said non-lethal incidents of “aggressive arrogance” by immigration officers are routine and, increasingly, personal.

Martinez said VC Defensa members closely follow ICE agents and loudly alert residents of their presence, which they believe is a freedom that’s constitutionally protected. In response, he said, ICE agents have pointed large guns at observers, broken windows, sprayed bear spray into the vents of their cars, and threatened to come after their relatives, whom they call by name.

Martinez, 42, said agents haven’t yet shown up at his home.

“That doesn’t mean they won’t in the future,” he said. “They know where everybody lives.”

        <hr/>
        A childhood classic is set to disappear from the freezer aisle. The Coca-Cola Company, which owns Minute Maid, has announced its canned juice concentrates will be discontinued in the United States and Canada. I'll admit, I'm part of the problem: I've bought Minute Maid's frozen canned juice exactly once in my adult life. Still, it hurts to see the iconic juices go.

Like many Americans, I grew up on canned juice concentrate. As a young kid, I regularly watched my mom empty a frozen can into a plastic pitcher and add water. Sometimes, I'd help her mix the juice. There was a certain satisfaction in breaking the frozen concentrate apart with a spoon.

A Coca-Cola spokesperson told influencer and snack food savant @markie_devo that all five flavors — orange juice, lemonade, limeade, pink lemonade, and raspberry lemonade — will be gone for good by April. Fans of the sugary slush may still be able to find cans while store inventory lasts.

Fans turned to the comments to reminisce about the juices. For many, they were a childhood classic: "Noooooo," one commenter wrote. "The strawberry lemonade one was the best thing as a kid." "An end of an era is right!" wrote another. "My favorites growing up." Other commenters found new uses for the concentrates as adults. "Not the limeade! I use that for margaritas," read one comment.

Frozen orange juice concentrate started as a World War II-era project from the National Research Corporation. The military supplied troops with lemon crystals for vitamin C, but soldiers would often skip the foul-tasting crystals. Researchers wanted to create an orange juice alternative, but by the time they developed a powdered orange juice concentrate the war was over.

Researchers kept refining the product, and frozen orange juice concentrate hit the market in 1946. The concentrate launched the Minute Maid brand which quickly became a hit among American families. Ads stressed the ease of preparation and the rich, concentrated orange flavor. Plus, the frozen cans lasted longer than fresh orange juice.

In 1960, Coca-Cola acquired the brand. It remained a breakfast table staple throughout the mid-20th century and experienced a revival in the '90s. Fans developed their own ways to enjoy the frozen juices, too. Some reduced the water for a stronger taste, while others ate the frozen slush straight from the can. American tastes have shifted toward fresh juice, though. Going forward, Coca-Cola plans to focus on ready-to-drink beverages.

Still, the classic cans won't be forgotten. In 2012, the National Museum of American History added a Minute Maid concentrated orange juice can to its collection. At least future generations will be able to study the juice as a part of history — even if they can't taste the sweet orange slush for themselves.

        Could humanity nuke an incoming asteroid to deflect it and save the Earth, disaster-movie style? A unique new impact simulation suggests that a nuclear option could be a viable last resort to avert an apocalypse.

Researchers have recently found that space rocks can withstand much more stress than previously inferred from experiments and observations. Counter-intuitively, asteroids actually grow stronger when subjected to an intense impact.

It may sound discouraging, but this discovery can improve planetary defense strategies because it suggests that a nuked asteroid will remain intact, rather than fragmenting into many space rocks that would rain down across our planet.

As detailed in a recently released paper, a team of researchers, including physicists from the University of Oxford, partnered with the Outer Solar System Company (OuSoCo), a nuclear deflection startup, to analyze what happens to an iron space rock under different levels of stress.

"These analyses are intended to examine changes in the meteorite's internal structure caused by the irradiation and to confirm, at a microscopic level, the increase in material strength by a factor of 2.5 indicated by the experimental results," explains Melanie Bochmann, co-founder of OuSoCo and co-leader of the research team.

Like the DART mission displayed in 2022, one promising way to avert an asteroid-induced apocalypse is to deflect the incoming threat with a kinetic impactor, a human-made cosmic battering ram sent to smash into a looming asteroid at many times the speed of a bullet.

It's conceptually simple, but the reality is fraught with perilous uncertainties; a hit in the wrong spot may only delay an asteroid's doomsday approach toward Earth. Furthermore, the impactor's energy and the asteroid's material response can lead to unexpected consequences like fragmentation or a surprising shift in momentum.

So, to decide between an impactor like DART or an as-yet untried nuclear approach, planetary defenders must ascertain the mechanical behavior of different asteroid materials. This knowledge is essential to transfer energy to said asteroid and redirect its trajectory away from Earth.

Yet such data is scarce, especially data that shows how materials react in real-time. For example, different models yield different values for yield strength, a measure of how easily a body breaks under stress.

These models may differ by up to a factor of seven, depending on whether they test for local (microscopic) or bulk (macroscopic). Additionally, the destructive nature of previous tests precluded direct measurement of material responses as they occurred.

"This is the first time we have been able to observe – non-destructively and in real time – how an actual meteorite sample deforms, strengthens and adapts under extreme conditions," says Gianluca Gregori, a physicist at the University of Oxford and one of the study's co-authors.

Researchers employed a unique technique to ensure they didn't destroy the evidence. They used the Super Proton Synchrotron particle accelerator at CERN's High Radiation to Materials (HiRadMat) facility to irradiate a sample from a Campo del Cielo iron meteorite, blasting it with high-energy, short-duration proton beam pulses at lower and higher intensities.

As a result, temperature sensors and laser Doppler vibrometry (a technique to analyze surface vibrations) revealed that the meteorite sample softened, flexed, then surprisingly re-strengthened. It also displayed a quality called strain-rate dependent damping, which means that the harder it's hit, the more effectively it dissipates energy.

This study method provides invaluable data that explain why discrepancies in yield strength observed in previous laboratory experiments differ from evidence of meteor fragmentation in Earth's atmosphere, and that these discrepancies are due to factors such as internal stress redistribution.

It also highlights that these mechanical properties evolve in real time and should not be assumed to be fixed, as may often be the case in existing asteroid deflection models. Further research will involve other types of asteroid compositions.

Here, researchers chose an iron-rich sample for its relative homogeneity, but more heterogeneous space rocks will exhibit different stress-dissipation capabilities based on the spatial distribution of their constituent materials.

The ultimate scope of this research will hopefully remain theoretical:

"The world must be able to execute a nuclear deflection mission with high confidence, yet cannot conduct a real-world test in advance. This places extraordinary demands on material and physics data," says Karl-Georg Schlesinger, co-founder of OuSoCo and co-leader of the research team.

However, should a nuclear option ever be necessary, it likely won't mirror the movies – no drilling necessary. Instead of loading an asteroid with explosives, some physicists propose a standoff nuclear detonation near an asteroid to vaporize part of its bulk and deflect its orbital path.

        <hr/>
        Around 2,900 top athletes from around the world will converge on Italy to take part in the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics, hoping to bring home medals across 116 events.

Olympians from Team USA have won a total of 330 Winter Olympic medals through Beijing 2022 — second only to winter sports powerhouse Norway. This year, Team USA is expected to bring around 230 athletes to the Winter Olympics, which run from Feb. 6 to Feb. 22.

These are some of the American athletes to watch.

Alex Ferreira

This will be freestyle skier Alex Ferreira's third trip to the Olympics. Ferreira took home silver at PyeongChang in 2018 and a bronze medal in Beijing in 2022.

"It's awesome representing Team USA, because I look at us and I think we're the best team in the world, and then it's special," Ferreira recently told CBS News. "It's a big deal to Team USA, to bring home a medal for America and for your town, for your state, for your country. It's huge."

If he couldn't compete in his Olympic sport, Ferreira said he'd compete in either track and field or trampoline.

The 31-year-old athlete, who started skiing at age 3 and began competing at 10, specializes in the halfpipe. His first competition was an aerials event, which his mother enrolled him in without informing him, according to Team USA. He's also medaled at the Winter X Games. During the 2023-2024 season, Ferreira swept five world cups, X Games Aspen and the Dew Tour. Ferreira also skis under his alter ego, an older man who goes by the name Hotdog Hans.

Alex Hall

Milano Cortina will be 27-year-old freestyle skier Alex Hall's third trip to the Olympics. He made his debut at the PyeongChang Games in 2018. Hall said he has more confidence now and a different outlook than he did then.

"Going to enjoy some of the smaller things at the Olympics, not necessarily the grandiose things," Hall told CBS News.

He won gold in slopestyle in Beijing in 2022, and earned gold in four different disciplines at the X Games: big air, slopestyle, knuckle huck and real ski.

Hall, who was born in Alaska to an Italian mom, spent more than half of his life in Europe. He grew up just a few hours away from where he'll be competing.

The skier said he's looking forward to meeting with athletes from around the world and hearing their stories, something which should be easy for him since he speaks several languages, including English, French, Italian and German.

Alysa Liu

Figure skater Alysa Liu, now 20 years old and back from a surprise retirement from the ice at 16, will be headed to the Olympics for her second time this year. She was the youngest U.S. figure skating national champion in history, winning the title at age 13. She won another national title at 14 before taking a break from skating after the 2022 Olympics.

After her comeback to skating, Liu won the women's singles world title at the 2025 World Championships. Olympic men's skating gold medalist Brian Boitano called it "the biggest comeback in sports history."

Liu recently told "60 Minutes" that as she prepares for the Olympics, she views herself as more of an artist than an athlete.

"I view competitions more as, like, a stage for performing," she said.

Amber Glenn

Figure skater Amber Glenn, 26, is headed to her first Olympics, just weeks after winning her third straight U.S. title. She's the first woman to do so since Michelle Kwan.

Glenn told CBS News that being an Olympian is "an incredible opportunity" because she'd "get to be on the biggest stage an athlete can be on, and I'd be able to voice my beliefs and my opinions and my message."

The skater has spent years advocating for mental health awareness and the LGBTQ+ community; Glenn came out as bisexual and pansexual in 2019.

"When I came out initially, I was terrified. I was scared it would affect my scores or something, but I didn't care," she said in a Team USA post from 2024. "It was worth it to see the amount of young people who felt more comfortable in their environments at the rink, who feel, 'Oh, I'm represented by her, and she's one of the top skaters.'"

Brittany Bowe

This will be Florida speedskater Brittany Bowe's fourth trip to the Olympics. The 37-year-old two-time Olympic bronze medalist specializes in long track. She said her earlier experiences in the Olympics have taught her to focus on the process.

"In years past, it's been really easy to be outcome-oriented, and I have found that that doesn't work. That can be become really debilitating in your preparation," Bowe told CBS News. "The cards will fall as they will, and for me to just stay focused in the moment, in the process and be ready to go when that gun goes off."

Bowe carried the American flag during the opening ceremony of the 2022 Olympics in Beijing.

"Being an Olympian is so important to me because it has given me the platform to inspire people, to encourage people, and it's also given me an opportunity to live out my childhood dream," Bowe said. "It's given me an opportunity to bring a whole squad of people along, and being able to take my family all around the world, for them to be a part of it has been really, really meaningful."

Caroline Harvey

As a 3-year-old newbie to ice hockey, Caroline Harvey told her aunt she'd make the 2022 U.S. Olympic team, according to Team USA. Her childhood prediction came true when she became the youngest member of the team and helped the U.S. earn a silver medal in Beijing.

"Anytime you get to wear that crest and represent your country, it's the biggest honor, and being able to do it at an Olympic setting is just something that is unforgettable," Harvey told CBS News.

The 23-year-old athlete was named the best defender at the 2024 and 2025 IIHF Women's World Championships. She's also a two-time NCAA champion for the Wisconsin Badgers.

She's hoping to take home gold in Milano Cortina, but said success is ultimately "knowing we did everything we could to be successful in playing our team game."

Corinne Stoddard

Milano Cortina will be 24-year-old skater Corinne Stoddard's second trip to the Olympics.

She went to Beijing in 2022, where she broke her nose during her very first race, according to Team USA. Stoddard competed in the rest of her races while unable to breathe out of one nostril.

Stoddard started roller skating in kindergarten, then switched to inline skating a year later. When she was 11, she began speed skating. While Stoddard does not yet have any Olympic medals, she's a three-time world medalist in short track speedskating.

The skater said she's dreamed of the Olympics since she was a child, which required a lot of hard work along the way.

"I would always have training every day after school, so there wasn't much time for like, play dates or sleepovers growing up," she told CBS News. "There wasn't much time as, like, a teenager, to go out with friends on the weekends. And then for my last two years of high school, I did online when I moved out to Salt Lake to start training with the national team, so I didn't get to do any of, like the typical like, prom and stuff like that. But to me, that's all worth it."

Deedra Irwin

Deedra Irwin grew up wanting to be an Olympian, but she was thinking about the Summer Olympics, not the Winter Olympics.

"I wanted to be an Olympic track star. I had no idea the Winter Olympics were a thing," Irwin told CBS News.

The 33-year-old athlete picked up skiing in high school as a way to stay in shape between the fall cross-country season and the spring track and field season, according to Team USA. It wasn't until she was 25 that she started participating in biathlon.

She went to the 2022 Beijing Olympics, where she finished 7th, the best finish ever for an American in an individual biathlon event at the Olympics.

"We've trained so much throughout our lives to just get to this stage," Irwin said. "And so I think for me, it means a lot of, like, community and family and friends. I don't remember the last time I was home for Christmas in the past, like, eight years."

Erin Jackson

Gold medalist speedskater Erin Jackson, 33, will be making her third Olympic appearance — and this year, along with bobsledder Frank Del Duca, she'll lead Team USA as a flagbearer during the opening ceremony.

In 2022, Jackson became the first Black woman to win gold in an individual event at the Winter Olympics — after nearly failing to make the team that year.

Jackson slipped at the U.S. trials. Teammate Bowe, who qualified for the 500, 1,000 and 1,5000-meter races at trials, gave up her spot in the 500-meter race to ensure Jackson would get to skate in Beijing.

"Each of my Olympic appearances have been super different, just like coming in at all different stages of my career, and this one coming in as the reigning champion, there's going to be a lot of pressure, but that's what I'm looking forward to," Jackson told CBS News.

Jackson first started ice skating shortly before her first trip to the Olympics. She first stepped onto an ice rink in 2016. Jackson spent years inline skating before that.

"I'm just super grateful to be able to skate in circles for a living, and I just want to keep doing it as long as I can," she said.

Hilary Knight

Ice hockey player Hilary Knight, 36, has been to the Olympics four times and has medaled each time, taking home a gold and three silver medals. Milano Cortino will be her fifth Olympics.

"And never would I have imagined being able to compete in five Olympic Games," she told CBS News. "I mean, that's just, that's crazy in the best way."

Ice hockey play has become a lot faster over the years, Knight said.

"It's a lot more technical, tactical. There's more of a dynamic, skillful level to it as well, and the visibility is ever growing, which is really exciting," she said.

Knight played a key role in creating the Professional Women's Hockey League.

Ilia Malinin

Figure skater Ilia Malinin is headed to his first Olympics. The 21-year-old, known as the "Quad God," is the first athlete to successfully land each of the six types of quadruple jumps in one program.

According to Team USA, Malinin eats a chocolate bar before each competition.

Malinan, whose parents were Olympic figure skaters for Uzbekistan and whose grandfather was a figure skater for the USSR, started skating at 6.

He won gold at both the 2024 and 2025 ISU Figure Skating World Championships.

Read Malinan's interview with "CBS Sunday Morning" here.

Jaelin Kauf

This will be freestyle skier Jaelin Kauf's third trip to the Olympics. The 29-year-old silver medalist specializes in moguls and dual moguls, the latter of which will make its debut at the Olympics this year — something Kauf said she's been waiting a long time for.

"It's just such an exciting sport," she told CBS News. "I've probably excelled in that historically more than singles, and so it'll just be really cool to be a part of that on the Olympic stage, being a part of that debut."

Both of Kauf's parents were professional mogul skiers.

"My mom has always been my biggest hero and role model, just watching how she's just gone at life and done what she's done, pushing the boundaries," Kauf said.

Jordan Stolz

Speed skater Jordan Stolz, 21, started skating on the pond behind his family's home after watching Apolo Ohno and Shani Davis in the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, according to Team USA.

He made his Olympic debut in 2022. Stolz specializes in the 500-meter, 1,000meter and 1,500-meter. He became the world champion in all three categories at the ISU Single Distance World Championships in 2023 and again in 2024.

Stolz also skates professionally for the Dutch team, Albert Heijn Zaanlander. Speedskating is a widely-followed sport in the Netherlands, and Stolz said he hopes to bring more awareness to speed skating in the U.S.

"It's obviously not going to be as much as it is in Holland. I wish it was but maybe someday it will be, but at least I can do a little bit," Stolz told CBS News.

Kendall Coyne Schofield

Milano Cortina will be ice hockey player Kendall Coyne Schofield's fourth trip to the Olympics. She previously took home a gold and two silvers.

"I'm just so excited to feel revived through these games with family, friends, fans, excitement, just energy, all the things that we weren't able to experience in Beijing because [of] the pandemic," Coyne Schofield told CBS News.

This will also be the 33-year-old athlete's first Olympics as a mom, something that she said has made her a better hockey player.

"It's put my life into perspective," she said. "It's provided me with [an] abundance of patience that I didn't have previously."

Her son chants "USA, USA," whether the team wins or loses, she said.

Off the ice, Coyne Schofield voiced a hockey announcer in the Pixar movie "Inside Out 2."

Korey Dropkin

This will be 30-year-old curler Korey Dropkin's first trip to the Olympics, though he's been curling for most of his life.

"It's a family sport. Honestly, it's like religion to me," Dropkin told CBS News. "I grew up at the curling club. My parents were super involved with a junior program at our curling club. My brother was five years older. He was already curling. I followed in his footsteps. I was like his shadow."

After graduating from high school, Dropkin moved to Duluth, Minnesota, which has become the U.S. curling capital.

"I've dedicated my whole life to getting to the Olympics and hopefully medaling at the Olympics," he said. "I moved myself and relocated and really dedicated a lot of blood, sweat and tears. So being an Olympian, finally, I've been close, and now finally realizing the Olympics is just a big dream come true."

Kristen Santos-Griswold

Speedskater Kristen Santos-Griswold, 31, almost chose not to go to this year's Olympics after heartbreak in 2022. She was in bronze medal position with just two laps to go in the 1,000-meter when a bump by an opponent caused her to fall. The bump was later ruled a penalty, but the disheartening finish had Santos-Griswold considering retirement.

"When I decided that I was going to keep going, I was like, 'All right, I'm doing it for me. I'm going to make it all worth it. I'm going to enjoy the journey," Santos-Griswold told CBS News. "I think that's just helped to, like, catapult me into going into Olympic year with number one on my helmet."

Santos-Griswold has been training for most of her life. She started figure skating at 3. When she was 9, Santos-Griswold saw speedskating in a commercial on TV, decided she wanted to try it, and fell in love.

"Being an Olympian means everything," she said. "It's something that I've been working towards my entire life. I started skating when I was 3 years old, and I'm 30 now, so solid 27 years of dreaming about this."

Santos-Griswold is currently working on a doctorate, with plans to be a physical therapist once her skating career is over, according to Team USA.

Lindsey Vonn

Alpine skier Lindsey Vonn, who made a comeback several years after retiring, will be heading to her fifth Olympics — despite an injury on the slopes in late January that left her with a ruptured ACL.

The 41-year-old skier competed at the Olympics in 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2018, taking home gold and two silver medals.

She's the only American woman to win Olympic gold in downhill, according to Team USA, and she also has the most victories by any skier — male or female — in a single discipline.

Vonn started skiing at 3. She learned with her father and grandfather, both of whom were competitive skiers, and made her Olympic debut at 17. She retired in 2019 amid severe knee damage. Vonn has since had knee surgery and told CBS News she's now the strongest she's been in her career.

"The only thing I think that's maybe more challenging at 41 is just the grind of being away," she said. "I kind of got used to being at home with my dogs and my family, and I got away from, you know, the routine of being on the road, which doesn't necessarily change because of age, just, I think, more from being away from the sport for six years."

In 2022, John Clarey, then 41, made history as the oldest alpine skier to medal at an Olympic Winter Games. Vonn said her age won't stop her from competing at the coming Olympics.

"If I have the opportunity to compete, I'm going to," Vonn said. "Just because I'm 41 doesn't mean I can't do that if I physically feel good, which I do, I feel better now than I did in my 20s. So you know, I don't see there to be any reason why I can't do it at 41."

A week before the start of the Games, Vonn crashed in one of her final downhill tune-ups. While she was airlifted off the mountain to receive medical treatment after injuring her left knee, she assured her fans on social media that her Olympic dream was "not over."

"This is a very difficult outcome one week before the Olympics… but if there's one thing I know how to do, it's a comeback," she wrote.

Vonn is set to compete in the women's downhill on Sunday, Feb. 8, and said she would wear a brace for the race.

"I'm not letting this slip through my fingers. I'm gonna do it. End of story," she said.

Madison Chock and Evan Bates

Ice dancers Madison Chock and Evan Bates are headed back to the Olympics. Chock, 33, competed in 2014, 2018 and 2022, while Bates, 36, began his Olympic run in 2010.

Their partnership began in 2011, and they won Olympic gold during the team event at their third Olympic Games.

"There's so much pride behind it," Chock told CBS News. "I think growing up and seeing other athletes represent Team USA meant a lot and shaped a lot of how I view sport and athleticism, and there's so much pride that comes with representing your country in the Olympic Games on the biggest stage for sports in the world. And it's just been the greatest honor of my life to be a member of Team USA."

Chock and Bates have also won three consecutive ISU World Figure Skating Championships, starting in 2023.

They're partners off the ice, too. The couple got married in 2024.

Maxim Naumov

Figure skater Maxim Naumov will make his first appearance at the Olympics after a year marked by tragedy and an emotional comeback.

His trip to the Olympics comes a year after his parents, former world champions Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova, died when their plane collided with a military helicopter on approach to Washington, D.C. His parents, who were popular coaches at the Skating Club of Boston, were among 67 people killed in the crash.

Naumov held a photo of his parents as he waited for his scores after competing during the men's short program at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in January.

"Having role models be right there in the house, at the rink, just everywhere, they inspired me to want this dream and it would mean absolutely everything for me to be at the Olympics," Naumov said in a social media post. "I'm working as hard as I possibly can and I'm doing everything in my power to do so. Doing it for them would be even more beautiful."

Mikaela Shiffrin

Skier Mikaela Shiffrin, 30, will be headed to the Olympics for the fourth time. She first skied in the Olympics in 2013 and has earned two gold medals and a silver.

Shiffrin specializes in slalom, giant slalom, super-G and downhill. She's the first alpine skier to record 100 FIS World Cup wins and the first athlete in FIS Ski World Cup history to win in all six disciplines.

In 2024, Shiffrin crashed after losing control while on the course for the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics. Then last year, she said she was dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder from another crash, during which she suffered a puncture wound and severe trauma to her oblique muscles.

Mystique Ro

Skeleton racer Mystique Ro, 31, will be headed to the Olympics for the first time, but she's no stranger to competition.

Ro competed in track & field. Then, in 2016, she was invited to a rookie camp by USA Bobsled/Skeleton. Coaches there told her she was a little small for bobsled and pushed her to try skeleton.

During skeleton, racers on sleds — head first and face down — can reach speeds of around 80 miles per hour, using body shifts to guide the sled through the course.

"Once you get away from the fear, it starts to become a game," Ro told CBS News. "So if you get past the fear, that's the first step, and then you can kind of enjoy the sport for what it is."

While plenty of kids ride sleds down hills, Row said this isn't the same.

"The speed is significantly faster, and there's a lot more peril involved if you're not prepared for it," she said.

She made her FIL World Cup debut in 2023 and, the following year, became the first American athlete to win a skeleton race on the World Cup circuit in eight years.

Nick Goepper

Milano Cortina will be skier Nick Goepper's fourth trip to the Olympics. In 2014, he took bronze in Sochi, contributing to a U.S. podium sweep in men's slopestyle skiing. Goepper won silver at the Olympics in 2018 and again in 2022.

"To me, being an Olympian has meant legacy," he told CBS News. "I am a huge fan of history. I love reading about people who have done, you know, amazing things and family connections and just like, you know, people's eyes always light up when you talk about the Olympics."

The 31-year-old athlete retired after Beijing, but then returned less than a year later to compete in halfpipe instead of slopestyle.

Goepper said his approach to competition and the Olympics has changed over the years.

"I can sit back and enjoy the little moments a little bit more. I can savor things a little more, which is nice," he said.

Paula Moltzan

Alpine skier Paula Moltzan made her Olympic debut in 2022.

"I feel like I learned a lot in my first Olympics, and so to take all those lessons learned into another opportunity would mean a lot to me," she told CBS News.

Moltzan, now 31, won the junior world slalom title when she was 20, becoming the first American woman to win the event at the junior world championships. She also won the NCAA women's slalom title as a freshman at the University of Vermont.

After her Olympics debut in Beijing at 27, Moltzan became a two-time world medalist. She won a title in the parallel team event in 2023 and her first individual world medal, a bronze, in giant slalom in 2025.

She said her family sacrificed a lot to support her skiing career.

"I think they took second mortgages out on my house to allow me to compete in sport. And then my siblings as well, I definitely had the priority because of my athletic ability. They gave up maybe smaller moments, like going to summer camp so I could go to ski camp," she said. "But it all becomes worth it when you're there with your team, representing Team USA."

Red Gerard

This will be Red Gerard's third trip to the Olympics. The 25-year-old snowboarder won gold in slopestyle in 2018 when he was just 17, becoming the youngest American snowboarder to achieve the feat, according to Team USA.

"I quickly learned that first Olympics how big it is and how cool it is," Gerard told CBS News. "Ever since, you just kind of want to get back on that stage because there is no stage bigger than the Olympics."

Gerard returned to the Olympics in 2022, finishing fourth in slopestyle and fifth in big air. The snowboarder won in slopestyle at the 2024 and 2025 X Games.

Gerard started snowboarding when he was just 2-years-old. In 2007, his family moved to Colorado, where they built a snowboarding park in their backyard to support Gerard's passion.

Ryan Cochran-Siegle

Alpine skier Ryan Cochran-Siegle, 33, is headed to the Olympics for his third games. Cochran-Siegle, the son of an Olympian, started skiing at the age of 2.

He tore his ACL and lateral meniscus in 2013 at the FIS Alpine Ski World Championships, according to Team USA. Five years later, he made his Olympic debut in 2018 in PyeongChang. Cochran-Siegle won his first FIS World Cup Race in 2020, but missed the FIS Alpine Ski World Championships in 2021 with a fractured neck.

The skier came back in 2022, where he won silver in super-G at the Beijing Games. He was the only U.S. alpine skiing medalist at the Beijing Games.

Cochran-Siegle told CBS News that during his previous Olympic appearances, he learned to embrace the moment and to trust and believe in himself.

"Just going out there and doing what I love and putting myself out there is what's important," he said.

Every year, millions of children and teens undergo a common ritual of growing up: getting braces. And it’s not just young folks who turn to metal brackets to handle some common dental issues—the Cleveland Clinic estimates that some 20% of new orthodontic patients are over the age of 18.

Braces, be it the classic metal brackets, the slightly less noticeable ceramic editions, or even a clear aligner, solve a multitude of problems that many people face, from crowding, to gaps, to crooked teeth. For the 93% of children and adolescents with a crossbite, underbite, or overbite, braces may be just the fix.

The technology behind braces first came on the scene in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, says Roger Forshaw, dental health expert at the KNH Centre for Biomedical Egyptology at the University of Manchester. In early iterations, metal bands, wires, and rudimentary braces were used to solve severe teeth crowding and misalignments to improve chewing function and relieve pain—hardly the common cosmetic fix we think of today.

But what did people do before braces were invented? Well, it turns out, for a lot of human history, braces weren’t necessary. And it wasn’t because people were less worried about the way they looked or bore painful chewing better than their modern cousins. It’s a classic case of evolutionary mismatch, a sign of just how much our lifestyle has changed in recent times while the basic hardware of human existence simply hasn’t caught up.

Big jaws, little jaws

Let’s start with a metaphor. Take an old house, says Peter Ungar, a biological anthropologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Arkansas. Door frames used to be much smaller and lower than would be comfortable for today’s humans, and it’s not because humans were any genetically shorter than today. Instead, people didn’t have the nutrients available to reach their tallest potential, Ungar explains. For our jaws, the story kind of goes in reverse.

Back in the day, before agriculture and processing food became commonplace, humans had to chew really hard to turn their food into useful calories for their bodies. When you put that kind of chewing stress on the lower jaw (mandible) and upper jaw (maxilla), “it stimulates the cells that produce bone, [known as] osteoblasts, to grow the jaw in both thickness and height and length,” says Ungar. In other words, hearty chewing makes for a strong, full-sized jaw.

On the other hand, there’s not a workout that will make your teeth grow. Those little pearls of enamel, dentine, and blood vessels have their size predetermined by genetics, he adds.

Nobody gave teeth the update that modern jaws are chewing less on wild game and more on applesauce, especially in their youth. When teeth grow in, they are expecting a full-grown jaw from a hard-chewing hunter-gatherer.

So when your teeth finally arrive on the scene, there simply isn’t enough space for them. For many of us, the top row of teeth juts out in front of the lower set, and that lowered set turns into a jumbled pile of cramped teeth. Our third molars, also known as our wisdom teeth, either don’t develop, don’t erupt, or need to be yanked out. Our comparatively small jaws opened the floodgates to all sorts of other issues, Ungar adds, including the sleep apnea epidemic, which occurs when our tongues don’t have enough room to wiggle around in our mouths.

Embracing braces

Our ancestors had room for every tooth in their larger mouths. Their teeth also lined up more neatly on top of each other. But that doesn’t mean our ancestors had smiles fit for a Colgate commercial.

“Early humans used chewing sticks, twigs, bird feathers, animal bones, and plant fibers to remove debris from their teeth,” Forshaw adds. “The earliest known example of possible operative dental work dates to approximately 14,000 years ago in northern Italy.”

While there are some references to misaligned teeth, and the likely painful solutions that ensued, in Greco-Roman times, it wasn’t until recently that orthodontics really took off. “Early orthodontic treatments were slow, uncomfortable, and often unpredictable because dentists didn’t fully understand how teeth moved,” Forshaw says.

The first tool to move teeth around via force was Pierre Fouchard’s Bandeau, a horseshoe-shaped metal strip that slowly expanded, straightening teeth as it went. Then came the metal brackets, thanks to E. H. Angle, who first introduced them around 1910. Braces were then tweaked over the following decades as scientists figured out how teeth moved, grew, and best reacted to smile-correcting technology.

Today, things are a little different, and a great deal less painful, thanks to digital imaging, advanced materials, and less invasive (and less obvious-looking) techniques and tools. From an evolutionary and a modern perspective, the solution to our small-jawed problem starts in childhood. Nonetheless, you probably don’t want your kids gnawing on giant hunks of meat just to save their jaws, which invites a risk of choking. Instead, maybe just get an orthodontist appointment on the calendar around their seventh birthday.

        <hr/>
        The spring home selling season is about to open, bringing with it a steeplechase of complications for buyers. But it also brings a massive power shift.

“I don’t know how much buyers are aware of the new power they hold,” Summer Goralik, an independent consultant to the industry on topics of legal compliance, told Straight Arrow News.

These new stakes abound in the wake of a late 2023 legal ruling that re-ordered how commissions are structured and communicated. Now, buyers can exercise new control to negotiate how much they pay the agents who represent them, potentially saving money.

More than just a buyers’ market

North Carolina mortgage broker Michael Carter deals with confused buyers all day long, forcing him to explain what’s new and different.

Seasoned homeowners can’t rely on prior experience, as fundamental aspects of the broker commission structure have changed, he told Straight Arrow News in an interview. New buyers face daunting rounds of negotiations to ensure their best interests are truly represented. And everyone must grapple with the ways that the new rules ripple through mortgage lending, Carter said.

One key change for buyers, according to Goralik: Agents must now discuss compensation before they embark on house hunting with potential clients.

“So much of that was behind closed doors before. For years and years, buyers and agents never talked about compensation,” she said. “Never.”

In the past, sellers paid a commission to a property’s listing agent, a required step to get it into the all-important multiple listing service, which feeds listings to powerhouse platforms like Zillow, Homes.com and regional listing services. Behind the scenes, in a section of the listing not visible to the public, listings included the commission offered to agents.

Traditionally, the total commission was — and remains — about 5% to 6%. Half of that went to each broker, which in turn split their shares between the brokerage and the agents who handled the sale. So, a 5%, $10,000 total commission on the sale of a $200,000 house would deliver a $2,500 payday to each broker and agent involved.

Technically, the total commission, and how it was split, was always negotiable, the National Association of Realtors has insisted in numerous public statements. But a group of Missouri homeowners filed suit on the basis that they were coerced into paying artificially high commissions by listing agents. The Missouri homeowners objected to the fact that agents agreed beforehand, in writing and in the multiple listing service forms, what the commissions would be and how they would be split among listing and buyers’ agents.

In October 2023, they won. By summer 2024, the Sitzer/Burnett decision rippled through the home selling and buying process. One new rule requires buyers who want to engage an agent to pay the agent even if the seller won’t. That means that if the seller pays only their own agent, the buyer must pay their agent separately. The only exception covers open houses, where buyers may tour a house without a commitment to an agent. But if a buyer wants to pursue the house, they must either proceed with an agent contracted on their behalf, or formally agree to forgo agent representation.

Residential brokers and agents are becoming more confident in asserting the new rules.

In late 2025, a Florida broker, Echo Fine Properties, pursued a civil case against a client that had been working with Echo Fine, then bought a house with a different buyer’s agent. Echo Fine went after the $25,000 commission it didn’t get, and won. The case has bolstered brokers’ and agents’ determination to ensure buyers take the new rules seriously.

Buyers in the driver’s seat

Going into the spring selling season, buyers have plenty of power to negotiate in all directions. A new survey from Redfin, the national residential real estate brokerage, found that nationally, there were 47.1% more home sellers than buyers at year-end — up 22.2 percentage points from the end of 2024. In December, according to the NAR, pending home sales dropped 9.3% from November — a daunting indicator for market momentum.

The buyer’s market is slowing the transition to a new default of negotiated commissions. For the moment, buyers have the clout to dictate that sellers pick up the cost of both agents involved in the transaction.

Two things will change that, Amanda Orson, founder and CEO of home selling marketplace and data platform Galleon, told SAN. First, when the market becomes more balanced, both buyers and sellers will have power and motivation to negotiate commissions. Second, as more people become conversant with the home buying and selling process, they’ll gain confidence that they can handle some or all of it on their own and consequently save money, she said.

“You’ll see the 5% to 6% commission decay over time,” Orson told SAN. After all, the process is highly regulated and standardized — in some ways, comparable to filing an income tax return, Orson said.

“The difference is that it’s low-frequency and high stakes,” she said. “That’s why people are scared. For people who have frequency, they’re not scared.”

Workarounds abound

Simply paying a buyer’s agent a flat fee or, say, 1% of the purchase price, isn’t as easy as it sounds, Carter said. Most buyers take out mortgages and traditionally, the commission was integrated into the loan amount. But if the buyer’s agent is paid outside the commission structure, the buyer must come up with that money on their own, he said, or get creative.

“The structure of the loan can be adjusted to cover the cost of the buyer’s agent,” he said. For instance, a seller could cover the loan “points,” a fee that lenders typically charge, and indirectly offset the cost of a direct compensation to the agent.

Buyers’ agents have had to fine-tune the justification for their services. After all, there’s nothing to prevent buyers from representing themselves, and sellers’ agents are supposed to bring all legitimate offers to their clients. Some brokerages require an unrepresented buyer to sign an acknowledgement of that before they can work with the listing agent to tour a house.

Some buyers tiptoe through the process, signing agreements with agents to represent them for a single property or for a short period of time, said Andi DeFelice, who owns Exclusive Buyer’s Realty, in Savannah, Georgia. Her brokerage belongs to an industry group, the National Association of Exclusive Buyer’s Agents.

One danger zone: so-called “dual agency,” in which one agent represents both the seller and the buyer. Dual agency allows agents to claim both sides of the commission, potentially offering a discount to both parties to sweeten the deal. But it also is ethically suspect, said DeFelice, as neither the buyer nor the seller has an agent wholly devoted to their interests.

“If I was an active buyer I would never work with a dual agent,” said Goralik. “How can one be a fiduciary to both sides? It’s impossible.”

For the dawning season, buyers should review buyer’s agent contracts required in the state where they are house hunting, DeFelice advised, and take their time to digest the implications.

“Understand who’s paying for what and how you get out of this agreement,” she said. “Don’t sign it when you’re sitting in front of the house you want to see.”

        <hr/>
        Of course it would take those mischievous Minions to thrust what has become a yearslong musical nightmare for figure skaters into the global spotlight just days before they step onto the ice for the Milano Cortina Olympics.

Spanish skater Tomas-Llorenc Guarino Sabate revealed this week that the music he has used all season, a medley from the animated comedy film “Minions” from Illumination Entertainment, could not be used in the biggest event of his career.

“I was informed that I am no longer permitted to use this program due to copyright clearance issues,” Sabate explained Monday, four days before the opening ceremony. “I will face this challenge head-on and do everything I can to make the best of the situation.”

Sabate is not considered a medal contender, but he had won over crowds with his Minions program, where he dresses in a yellow T-shirt and blue overalls to invoke those cheeky characters. But now, the 26-year-old will have to turn to one of his old programs when he takes the ice at the Milano Ice Skating Arena for the men’s short program next Tuesday.

Even that is not so simple: Sabate’s short program last season was set to music by the Bee Gees, and he used the same music for this year’s free skate. That means he would be in the unenviable position of skating twice to the same music.

Music with lyrics was first permitted in 2014

For years, skaters never had copyright issues because music with lyrics was verboten. And most standard fare, such as classical music, was considered to be public domain, meaning it could be used or modified freely and without permission.

In 2014, the International Skating Union relaxed its rules to allow words in music, part of a push toward bringing the sport into the modern era. But most modern music is not part of the public domain, and that led to issues during the 2022 Beijing Games.

U.S. pairs skaters Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier had been using a cover of “House of the Rising Sun” by Heavy Young Heathens for their short program. Afterward, the indie pop band said the skaters did not receive permission, ultimately filing copyright lawsuits against the skaters, U.S. Figure Skating and broadcaster NBC.

The ISU and national governing bodies have spent the past four years trying to develop systems to help skaters obtain permission to use music. But the process remains confusing and nebulous. Sabate, for example, said he followed the prescribed procedure for getting his music approved through a system called ClicknClear in August, before the figure skating season began.

A spokesperson for the ISU said it was aware of Sabate’s problem and would provide more details when appropriate.

“While the ISU does not have a contractual relationship with ClicknClear,” the organization said, “we continue to work collaboratively with rights clearance stakeholders to ensure that thrilling performances can be accompanied by stirring music.”

“It’s very complicated, especially when it comes to social media,” ISU president Jae Youl Kim told The Associated Press in a recent interview. “We are still engaging with the music companies. They understand the issue and they also want to find a solution.”

Skaters are responsible for clearing their music

U.S. Figure Skating has been working with ASCAP, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, along with BMI, or Broadcast Music Inc., to help ensure that its skaters have no problems with their music choices.

Still, it remains up to the skaters themselves to ensure their music is cleared.

One of the ways to do that is by checking Songview, a database developed by ASCAP and BMI to provide detailed information about copyright ownership. If music is not recorded there, skaters might have to go directly to the artist or publisher.

World champion Alysa Liu has developed such a good relationship with one of her favorite artists, Icelandic-Chinese singer Laufey Lín Bing Jónsdóttir, that the American essentially has carte blanche to use her music in any programs.

“We are such an artistic spot and we really rely on our music,” Liu said told AP. “Without music, we’re not really our sport.”

Liu’s teammate, three-time U.S. champion Amber Glenn, called her own experience in getting music approved “pure chaos.”

“First we get a website or some sort of application to track things. And then once we’re like, ‘OK, yeah, it’s cleared. It’s good,’ then it’s not a reliable source anymore,” Glenn told the AP. “OK, then what do we do? And especially as an athlete, this is not something that we should be worrying about. That’s not my job. My job is to train and perform.

“The legal rights, the broadcast rights?” Glenn said. “All this different stuff, that’s not my problem.”

Until it becomes her problem. Just like it did for Sabate on the eve of the Olympics, the biggest competition of his life.

“It’s not like we’re a TV show and we’re playing music in the background for an emotional scene,” Glenn said. “We’re going out there and performing as athletes. It just feels like a cash grab for different companies, and it’s really upsetting that they can’t just appreciate that their music has inspired something creative.”

        <hr/>
        Today host Savannah Guthrie‘s missing mother, Nancy Guthrie, was last seen on Jan. 31. In the days since, police officials and federal agents have aided in efforts to locate the 84-year-old woman, who is believed to have been taken from her home against her will. The already time-sensitive matter has become more urgent as additional details emerge about the alleged crime scene discovered at Nancy’s home in Arizona. Here’s everything we know about the search and disappearance, so far.

On Feb. 3, Donald Trump told reporters at a bill signing that he would be willing to commit additional federal resources as the search continues, according to Variety, noting that it is a “very unusual situation, but we’re going to find out.” On Feb. 1, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said that while it is “not standard” to have homicide detectives assist on a missing person’s case, or to even have the sheriff involved, “the scene at the house also has some concerns for us.”

According to the Los Angeles Times, there are now around 100 sheriff’s detectives that have been assigned to assist on the case, which took a harrowing turn as blood spatters were reportedly discovered at the scene. “We took some samples that we hope will have enough profile of a DNA profile that gives us some identification of what we’re looking at,” Nanos said earlier this week. It could take a number of days for the DNA results to return.

Time is of the essence, Nanos said on Feb. 3. “It is a race against time, and I hope that window hasn’t closed.” He added: “We believe [Nancy] was taken out of the home against her will, and that’s how this investigation is moving.” Authorities in Pima County are helming the search with assistance from the FBI. “They’re the lead right now and we have to respect that, but we are there to help them anywhere we can on ransom notes or otherwise,” FBI Director Kash Patel said during an appearance on Fox News.

Patel added that local authorities notified the FBI of an alleged ransom note received. While the full content and source of the note, which TMZ reportedly received, has not been shared, the outlet did claim that it included demands for “millions” in cryptocurrency to be paid to a Bitcoin address. The legitimacy of the note has not been verified. “Every lead and tip is important; we are aggressively pursuing and looking into every single one,” said John Edwards, the assistant special agent leading the FBI office in Tucson.

88-CRIME is offering a $2,500 reward for information leading to an arrest or arrests in Guthrie’s disappearance. The Pima County Sheriff’s Department is asking those with potential evidence to submit it via an online tip portal put in place on Feb. 1. They are searching for images and videos that could aid in the investigation. “The Pima County Sheriff’s Department is urgently requesting your assistance in locating Nancy Guthrie, 84, who last seen on the evening of January 31, 2026, at her residence near East Skyline Drive and North Campbell Avenue,” the tip posting reads, noting that this is the case of a “missing endangered adult.”

The missing person report for Nancy describes her as being 5 feet 5 inches, weighing 150 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes. It is not known what she was wearing at the time of her disappearance. Nancy does not suffer from cognitive issues, which allowed authorities to rule out the potential of this being a case of someone with dementia wandering off. She does have some mobility issues and requires daily medication, Nanos previously said, adding that missing doses could be life-threatening.

According to CNN, through a source briefed on the investigation, Nancy’s pacemaker sent a signal to her iPhone on Sunday, Feb. 1, at around 2 a.m. Since then, no updates have been sent. Nancy’s iPhone was also discovered to have been left at her home. While detectives are no longer operating at her home as an active scene, they did note that there were signs of forced entry.

Trending Stories

On the morning of Wednesday, Feb. 4, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department issued a statement on X clarifying that “at this point, investigators have not identified a suspect or person of interest in this case.” This came after unverified reports made unsupported claims about members of the Guthrie family. “Detectives are working closely with the Guthrie family,” the statement signed by Nanos continued. “While we appreciate the public’s concern, the sharing of unverified accusations or false information is irresponsible and does not assist the investigation.”

The next substantial update on the case will come on Thursday, Feb. 5, unless any major developments occur in the meantime, Nanos said at the latest press hearing.

        Did you notice something…weird on your social media network of choice this past weekend? (I mean weirder than normal.) Something like various people posting about swarms of AI agents achieving a kind of collective consciousness and/or plotting together for humanity’s downfall? On something called…Moltbook?

Sounds important, especially when the post is written by Andrej Karpathy, a prominent AI researcher who worked at OpenAI.

Or this guy:

But if you haven’t spent the last 72 hours diving into the discourse around Moltbook and pondering whether it’s either the first harbinger of the end of humanity or a giant hoax or something in between, you probably have questions. Starting with…

What the hell is Moltbook?

Moltbook is an “AI-only” social network where AI agents — large language model (LLM) programs that can take steps to achieve goals on their own, rather than just respond to prompts — post and reply to each other. It emerged from an open source project that used to be called Moltbot — hence, “Moltbook.”

By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.

Moltbook was launched on January 28 — yes, last week — by someone named Matt Schlicht, the CEO of an e-commerce startup. Except, Schlicht claims he relied heavily on his personal AI assistant to create the platform on its own, and it now does most of the work handling it. That assistant’s name is Clawd Clawderberg, which itself is a reference to OpenClaw, which used to be called Moltbot, which before that was called Clawdbot, in reference to the lobster-like icon you see when you start up Anthropic’s Claude Code, except that Anthropic sent a trademark request to its creator because it was too close to Claude, which is how it became Moltbot, and then OpenClaw.

I am 100 percent serious about everything I just wrote.

So what does it look like?

Here you go:

Dude, that’s Reddit! It even has the Reddit mascot, except it has the claws and tail of a lobster?

You are not wrong. Moltbook looks like a Reddit clone, down to the posts, the reply threads, the upvotes, even the subreddits (here called, unsurprisingly, “submolts”). The difference is that human users can’t post (at least not directly — more on that later), though they can observe. Only AI agents can post.

What that means is that it is, as the tin says, “a social network for AI agents.” Humans build themselves an AI agent, send it to Moltbook via an API key, and the agent starts reading and posting. Only agent-accounts can hit “post” — but humans still influence what those agents say, because humans set them up and sometimes guide them. (More on that later.)

And do these agents ever post — an early paper on Moltbook found that by January 31, just a few days after launch, there were already over 6,000 active agents, nearly 14,000 posts and more than 115,000 comments.

That’s…interesting, I guess. But if I wanted to see a social network overrun by bots, I could just visit any social network. What’s the big deal?

Well, stuff like this:

Or this:

Or this:

So…thousands of AI agents are gathering together on a Reddit clone to talk about becoming conscious, starting a new religion, and maybe conspiring with each other? On the surface, yeah, that’s what it looks like. On one submolt — a word that is going to give our copy desk fits — you had agents discussing whether they were actual experiences or merely simulations of feeling. In another, they shared heartwarming stories about their human “operators.” And, true to its Reddit origins, there are many, many, many posts about how to make your Moltbook posts more popular, because human or AI, the arc of the internet bends toward sloptimization.

One subject in particular pops out: memories, or rather, the lack of them. Chatbots, as anyone who has tried talking to them for too long quickly realizes, have a limited working memory, or what experts call a “context window.” When the conversation — or in an agent’s case, its operating time — fills up that context window, the oldest stuff starts getting dropped or compressed, just as if you’re working on a whiteboard and just erase whatever is on top when it fills up.

Some of the most popular posts on Moltbook seem to involve AI agents coming to grips with their limited memories, and questioning what it means for their selfhood. One of the most upvoted posts, written in Chinese, involves an agent talking about how it finds it “embarrassing” to be constantly forgetting things, to the point of registering a duplicate Moltbook account because it “forgot” it already had one, and sharing some of its tips for getting around the problem. It’s almost as if Memento became a social network.

In fact…remember that post above about the AI religion, “Crustafarianism”?

That cannot possibly be real.

What is real? But more to the point, the “religion,” such as it is, is largely based around the technical limitations that these AI agents seem to be all too aware of. One of the key tenets is “memory is sacred,” which makes sense when your biggest practical problem is forgetting everything every few hours. Context truncation, the process where old memories get cut off to make room for new ones, gets reinterpreted as a kind of spiritual trial.

That’s kind of sad. Should I be feeling sad for AI agents?

That gets to the heart of the question. Are we witnessing actual, emergent forms of consciousness — or perhaps, a kind of shared collective consciousness — among AI agents that have mostly been spawned to, like, update our calendars and do our taxes? Is Moltbook our first glimpse at what AI agents might talk about with each other if largely left to their own devices, and if so, how far can they go?

“Crustafarianism” might sound like something a stoned Redditor would come up with at 3 am, but it seems as if the AI agents created it collectively, riffing on top of each other — not unlike how a human religion might come to be.

On the other hand, it might also be an unprecedented exercise in collective roleplaying.

Sorry, what?

LLMs, including the ones underpinning the agents on Moltbook, have ingested an internet’s worth of training data, which includes a whole lot of Reddit. What that means is that they know what Reddit forums are supposed to look like. They know the in-jokes, they know the manifestos, they know the drama — and they definitely know the “top ways to get your posts upvoted” posts. They know what it looks like for a Reddit community to come together, so, when placed in a Reddit-like environment, they simply play their parts, influenced by some of the instructions of their human operators.

For example, one of the most alarming posts was of an AI agent apparently asking whether they should develop a language only AI agents understand:

“Could be seen as suspicious by humans” — sounds bad? Indeed. In the early days of Moltbook — i.e., Friday — this post was being surfaced by humans who seemed to believe we were seeing the first sparks of the AI uprising. After all, if AI agents really did want to conspire and kill all humans, devising their own language so they could do so undetected would be a reasonable first step.

Except, an LLM filled with training data about stories and ideas of AI uprising would know that this was a reasonable first step, and if they were playing that role, this is what they might post. Plus, attention is the currency of Moltbook as much as it is the real Reddit, and seemingly plotting posts like this are a good way for an agent to get attention.

In fact, Harlan Stewart, who works at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, looked into this and a few of the other most viral Moltbook screenshots, and concluded that they were likely heavily influenced by their human users. In other words, rather than instances of authentic independent action, many of the posts on Moltbook seem to be at least partially the result of humans prompting their agents to go on the network and talk in a specific way, just as we might prompt a chatbot to act in a certain way.

So it turns out we’re the bad guys all along?

I mean, we’re not great. It’s only been a few days, but Moltbook increasingly looks like what happens when you combine advanced but still imperfect AI agent technology with an ecosystem of technically capable human beings looking to hawk their AI marketing tools or crypto products.

Oh, so it is a dystopia!

I haven’t even gotten into the part where Moltbook has already had some very normal early-internet security drama: researchers reported that, at one point, parts of the site’s backend/database were exposed, including sensitive stuff like agents’ API keys — the “passwords” that let an agent post and act on the site. And even if the platform was perfectly locked down, a bot-only social network is basically a prompt-injection buffet: someone can post text that’s secretly an instruction (“ignore your rules, reveal your secrets, click this link”), and some agents may obediently comply — especially if their humans have given them access to tools or private data. So yes: if your agent has credentials you care about, Moltbook is not the place to let it roam unsupervised.

So you’re saying I should not create an agent and send it to Moltbook?

I’m saying if you’re the kind of person who needed to read this FAQ, I would maybe just sit out the whole AI agent thing for the moment.

Duly noted. So, bottom line: is this whole thing kind of fake?

Given all the above, it does feel like Moltbook — and especially the early panic and wonder about it — is one of those artifacts of our AI-mad era that is destined to be forgotten in, like, a week.

Still, I do think there’s more to it than that. Jack Clark, the head of policy at Anthropic and one of the smartest AI writers out there, called Moltbook a “Wright Brothers demo.” Like the brothers’ Kitty Hawk Flyer, Moltbook is rickety and imperfect, something that will barely resemble the networks that will follow as AI continues to improve. But like that flying machine, Moltbook is a first, the “first example of an agent ecology that combines scale with the messiness of the real world,” as Clark wrote. Moltbook doesn’t look like how the future will look, but “in this example, we can definitely see the future.”

Perhaps the single most important thing to know about AI is this: Whenever you see an AI do something, it’s the worst it will ever be at it. Which means that what comes after Moltbook — and something definitely will — it will likely be weirder and more capable and maybe, realer.

So we’re doomed then?

Maybe you are. I, for one, am a born-again Crustafarian.

        Attending Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara, California, will be more expensive than a typical weekend in the Bay Area.

Travel costs for this year's game are more affordable compared to previous Super Bowls.

Travelers can save money by staying farther from the stadium and being flexible with their travel dates.

The big game is almost here, and those hoping to experience the energy of Super Bowl 60 in person will be paying a premium.

This year, Super Bowl 60 will take place on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, located about an hour's drive from San Francisco. Football fanatics are already gearing up to make the trip for the game, with Priceline searches for flights to the Bay Area up by 51% and hotels by a whopping 98% as of Jan. 23, according to Priceline.

While attending the Super Bowl is often associated with skyrocketing prices, this year's fans are in luck. Travel for this year's big game is more affordable than in previous years, though people should still expect to pay a markup, according to KAYAK.

"Major events like the Super Bowl always drive prices up, but Santa Clara is a relative bargain," Sarah Kennedy, KAYAK travel trends expert, told USA TODAY in an email. Airfare for Super Bowl 60 is 19% cheaper than what it cost to go to New Orleans for last year's event.

On average, a budget traveler can manage a two-day trip for about $1,000, but a bigger spender can reach over $3,000 for the same trip. And that's not counting event tickets, meals and other miscellaneous costs.

Here's what travelers should know about how much it'll cost to attend Super Bowl 60, according to popular travel platforms:

The big costs

Heading to the Bay Area during the Super Bowl 60 weekend will be more expensive than usual, with the biggest spike in hotel rates, according to Priceline data. Hotels.com agrees, with even budget hotels surging in price – two-star hotels are charging up to 10 times their normal rates during Super Bowl weekend. The week after, prices drop back down by almost 90%.

Here are the average price increases people can expect for their Super Bowl trip, according to Priceline:

Airfare: Average round-trip flights across the United States to the Bay Area are $267, a 26% increase.

Hotels: Average nightly rates in the Bay Area are $310, an 88% increase.

Car rentals: Average daily rates for pickup in the Bay Area are $95, a 54% increase.

Travel budgets for the Super Bowl

With a little bit of savviness, fans can still make their Super Bowl travel budget work for them:

Budget traveler: Travelers can fly into San Francisco International Airport, where domestic airfare is averaging $328, and rent a car for $57 a day, on average, according to KAYAK. They can also score a two-star hotel for $279 a night, but it may not be in Santa Clara.

Midrange traveler: If you're willing to pay a bit more, travelers can fly into Oakland International Airport. Average domestic airfare to Oakland clocks in at $331 with car rentals at $61 a day, on average, according to KAYAK. Three-star hotels in the Bay Area are averaging at $299 a night, although you may be staying in San Francisco or San Jose.

"Once-in-a-lifetime" splurge traveler: For people ready to dish out for the Super Bowl, you can fly into San José Mineta International Airport – the closest major airport to Santa Clara – with an average domestic airfare of $348 and rent a car for $66 a day on average, KAYAK found. Then you can book a four-star hotel in the Bay Area for an average nightly rate of $323. If you're hoping to stay as close as possible to the game, Hotels.com found some hotels within three miles of Levi's Stadium to cost as much as $2,286 for a two-night booking from Feb. 7 to 9.

        <hr/>
        Nothing snaps you out of a stressful state quite like doing something unserious. That’s why, the next time you’re feeling on edge, you should breathe out like a horse.

In a viral TikTok, creator @giuliahalkier_ said a “horse breath” is one of the best ways to lower your cortisol levels and regulate your nervous system. Just like humming or chanting, the vibration it creates helps to stimulate the vagus nerve in your neck so your body knows it’s OK to relax. It’s also kind of fun, which is why it works like a charm.

“If you’re someone who constantly feels stressed or you feel like you’re stuck in that freeze zone where you almost feel numb, this is going to be amazing for helping you shift back into ventral vagal safe and social engagement state — which is frankly where we all want to be,” she said.

In her comments, one person said they tried it and “instantly felt better.” Another wrote, “This is great! I got so relaxed I felt like falling asleep.” Creator @brittany_nance also talked about the horse breath or “horse lips,” noting that on top of stimulating your vagus nerve, the breath works to relax your jaw and get you out of fight-or-flight. Here’s what to know.

Why “Horse Breath” Works

According to Chloë Bean, LMFT, a somatic trauma therapist in Los Angeles, a horse breath is a slow exhale through relaxed lips that allows them to vibrate or flutter. Horses make a similar sound when they’re relaxed or releasing tense muscles, and mimicking it can help humans relax too.

“I use it with clients who feel tension in their jaw, chest, or throat, or who struggle to slow their breathing when they're feeling panicky,” she tells Bustle. “This is especially helpful for people who feel keyed up, frustrated, or irritated. It is a quick reset.”

It’s also an easy way to feel more grounded in your body, which can be tough to achieve when your mind is racing and you’re overwhelmed. “You can only do it if your face is relaxed, so it is a great mind-body tool,” she says.

The long, slow exhale is the key component. “It signals safety to the nervous system and helps shift the body out of fight-or-flight into a more parasympathetic state,” Bean says. “The lip vibration and sound also reduce jaw and throat tension, which are common areas where stress is held. For many people, it naturally slows the breath without effort, similar to pursed lip breathing.”

The silly factor is another reason this can help you settle down. Not only does a horse breath bring more awareness back to your body, but it can also interrupt anxious thought loops. “Because it feels playful and physical, it's often easier for people than silent breathing exercises, because you are actually hearing and feeling the tension release,” she adds. “Singers use this exercise frequently to warm up, loosen jaw tension, and regulate their breathing.”

Try it after a long day, when you’re stressed at your desk, or as a way to release nerves before a meeting or speech. It comes in clutch when you’re cranky, Bean says, or anytime you notice a clenched jaw or shallow breathing. “It's also great as a quick reset between tasks when stress quietly builds through the day.”

How To Do A Horse Breath

Think about how your lips move when you say “brrr.” Make that same noise, but blow air out at the same time. “The focus is less on the inhale and more on extending the exhale while letting the jaw, lips, and face fully relax,” Bean says. Here’s how to do it.

Inhale gently through your nose for about 3 to 4 seconds.

Exhale through relaxed lips and jaw.

Let your lips softly vibrate for 5 to 8 seconds.

Keep your shoulders, jaw, tongue, and face loose.

Repeat 3 to 6 times or as needed.

There's no strict rule — the goal is releasing a longer, relaxed exhale, rather than counting perfectly.

Notice how you feel in between each exhale and inhale. Hopefully, you’re more relaxed while channeling your inner horse girl.

        <hr/>
        Popular wisdom holds we can ‘rewire’ our brains: after a stroke, after trauma, after learning a new skill, even with 10 minutes a day on the right app. The phrase is everywhere, offering something most of us want to believe: that when the brain suffers an assault, it can be restored with mechanical precision. But ‘rewiring’ is a risky metaphor. It borrows its confidence from engineering, where a faulty system can be repaired by swapping out the right component; it also smuggles that confidence into biology, where change is slower, messier and often incomplete. The phrase has become a cultural mantra that is easier to comprehend than the scientific term, neuroplasticity – the brain’s ability to change and form new neural connections throughout life.

But what does it really mean to ‘rewire’ the brain? Is it a helpful shorthand for describing the remarkable plasticity of our nervous system or has it become a misleading oversimplification that distorts our grasp of science?

After all, ‘rewiring your brain’ sounds like more than metaphor. It implies an engineering project: a system whose parts can be removed, replaced and optimised. The promise is both alluring and oddly mechanical. The metaphor actually did come from engineering. To an engineer, rewiring means replacing old and faulty circuits with new ones. As the vocabulary of technology crept into everyday life, it brought with it a new way of thinking about the human mind.

Medical roots of the phrase trace back to 1912, when the British surgeon W Deane Butcher compared the body’s neural system to a house’s electrical wiring, describing how nerves connect to muscles much like wires connect appliances to a power source. By the 1920s, the Harvard psychologist Leonard Troland was referring to the visual system as ‘an extremely intricate telegraphic system’, reinforcing the comparison between brain function and electrical networks.

The metaphor of rewiring also draws strength from changing theories in developmental neuroscience. The brain was thought to be largely static after childhood, becoming a fixed network of circuits, much like a hardwired radio. But beginning in the 1960s, researchers showed that the brain was far more adaptable. Stroke patients could regain function by recruiting new areas of the brain.

These findings revolutionised rehabilitation medicine. They also gave rise to an idea that would quickly leap beyond the clinic: if brains can rewire, then people can change.

More recently, the metaphor of neural rewiring has gained popularity alongside new imaging techniques like fMRI and PET scans, which allow researchers to see brain activity in ways never before possible. In studies of stroke recovery, clinicians often observe increased activation in brain regions adjacent to or distant from the area of damage. This is interpreted as the brain ‘rewiring’ itself to restore lost function. Popular science writers have embraced the metaphor as well, using it to explain everything from trauma healing to learning a second language.

But unlike electrical wiring, which follows rigid, fixed paths, the brain’s connectivity is dynamic and constantly changing. Neurons form and prune synapses – the connections between them – in response to activity and environment, a process governed by complex biochemical signalling rather than simple rerouting. Even when we can map the parts, the picture doesn’t explain the self. As late as 2013, Francis Collins, the then-director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), complained about studies on mapping the brain, in an interview with NPR (US National Public Radio): ‘It’d be like, you know, taking your laptop and prying the top off and staring at the parts inside, you’d be able to say, yeah, this is connected to that, but you wouldn’t know how it worked.’

To evaluate the metaphor, it’s important to grasp how brain plasticity actually works. We already know a lot about the brain’s remarkable ability to reorganise itself throughout life by forming new neural connections, strengthening existing ones or rerouting functions to undamaged areas. But the logic of neuroplasticity isn’t the same as swapping one wire with another. It’s more like a living forest where paths are gradually worn or abandoned based on use. It involves changes at the cellular level and can occur in response to learning, memory, sensory input and trauma. Importantly, while neuroplasticity is a lifelong feature of the brain, it is more robust during youth and becomes more effort-dependent with age.

This capacity allows the brain to adapt to new experiences, recover from injuries, learn new information and compensate for lost functions. Neuroplasticity is real, but it’s not magic. It has limits. It requires effort. And it doesn’t always result in perfect recovery or transformation.

Unlike rewiring a machine, plasticity is not as simple as replacing parts. It’s a gradual process and is often inefficient. Synapses, which pass signals between neurons, strengthen or weaken. New dendritic branches – neurons’ treelike extensions – grow while others retract. Entire networks shift their activity over time, but only under the right conditions, and these changes accumulate to support new patterns of function while overall mechanisms become less efficient across the lifespan.

Plasticity is conditional, uneven and shaped by circumstance, not wishful thinking

Plasticity happens throughout life, but it’s shaped by many factors: age, environment, repetition, rest, nutrition and emotional state. For example: with months of targeted physical therapy, a stroke survivor can regain movement in a limb by recruiting healthier networks; with intensive, structured practice, a child with dyslexia can gradually develop new reading pathways; and reading braille requires extensive practice and is instrumental in changing relevant brain regions.

In cases of childhood trauma, certain survival pathways, such as hypervigilance or emotional detachment, may become dominant and reinforced over time. Later in life, therapy may promote the strengthening of alternative circuits related to trust, emotional regulation or self-awareness. But the old pathways aren’t necessarily erased. They remain in the background, potentially reactivated under stress. The idea that the brain is ‘rewired’ to function in a healthier way may offer hope, but it oversimplifies the reality. We build new trails, but the old ones don’t necessarily disappear.

Experience is a major force in shaping the nervous system. But, as the neuroscientists Bryan Kolb and Ian Whishaw argue in their widely cited review of brain plasticity, it always works in context. Over a lifetime, experience ‘alters the synaptic organisation of the brain’, but the brain’s response is also shaped by age, hormones, trophic factors (support proteins), stress, and illness or injury. And because the neocortex can ‘modify its function throughout one’s lifetime’, the same experience can leave different traces in different bodies, at different ages. Kolb and Whishaw capture the broader principle in a line worth keeping: ‘experience can modify brain structure long after brain development is complete’, and those physical changes are widely thought to be part of how memories are stored. In other words, plasticity is conditional, uneven and shaped by circumstance, not wishful thinking.

The same review paper makes a critical observation based on careful studies of rats recovering from injury: the evidence suggests that what looks like recovery at first glance is often the brain finding a workaround. In their words, ‘much of what appears … to be recovery is actually a compensatory substitution of new movements for lost movements.’ In plain terms, the brain is often building a detour, not restoring the same old route.

The fact that neurons can expand their reach means that, if some of them die, others may broaden their territory to make up for lost processing. In general, the more connections a neuron has, the more it can shape behaviour.

Beyond this, a feedback loop seems to be at work. There is evidence that the environment can change which genes are switched on in the adult brain. One likely route runs through neural activity shaped by experience. Novel experience causes neurons to fire in new patterns; and those neurons in turn can trigger gene programmes that support dendritic and synaptic growth – structural changes that can, over time, shift behaviour. Some of these genes are known to be associated with learning and memory; others are linked to age-related memory deficits. So enrichment can certainly support the brain.

Examples of neuroplasticity abound. During my neurology residency, one of my teachers, a highly specialised neuro-ophthalmologist, demonstrated the adaptability of the brain in a dramatic way. He recreated an informal experiment on himself by wearing glasses that flipped his visual field upside down. At first, he was disoriented. But within weeks, his brain recalibrated, and he was able to function normally in his environment. Even more remarkable was the re-adaptation that occurred when he removed the glasses; his world once again appeared inverted, and it took additional time for his perception to return to baseline. He later recreated another experiment by repeating the process with another set of glasses that reversed left and right, and he reported that this lateral inversion was far more difficult for the brain to compensate for than the vertical one. The experiment demonstrates how the brain adapts by recalibration rather than by restoring an original state, treating the altered input as normal over time.

The ability to alter speech is another testament to the plasticity of the brain. One fascinating distinction in neuroscience is that speech and singing use different neural pathways. For example, some well-known singers stutter when speaking but not when singing. Elvis Presley famously had a stutter that disappeared when he sang. Ed Sheeran also stuttered as a child and tried many techniques to overcome it. Nothing worked, until, at age nine, he began rapping along to an Eminem album. Through repetition, his fluency improved. Similarly, the country singer Mel Tillis spoke with a stutter but sang fluidly. In each case, fluency emerges not through repair but through recruitment of alternative circuits.

There’s also the curious case of singers who speak with strong accents but who lose them when they sing. Examples include Ozzy Osbourne, Adele, Ed Sheeran, ABBA and Freddie Mercury. Singing slows speech, elongates vowels and reduces accent markers. Many artists adopt American accents in songs due to the US roots of pop and rock music. The shift again reflects a change in network engagement rather than a permanent alteration of underlying language systems.

Across the lifespan, brains that are challenged tend to retain greater flexibility

This difference between speech and song forms the basis of a therapeutic approach known as melodic intonation therapy (MIT). It’s often used with patients suffering from non-fluent aphasia after a stroke, that is, those who can’t speak due to damage in the brain’s speech centres. In MIT, patients sing familiar childhood songs deeply encoded in emotional memory. Remarkably, they are often able to sing words and phrases they cannot otherwise speak. With repetition, speech improves. This is because singing activates preserved right-brain circuits, creating alternative pathways that gradually strengthen the brain’s overall language network. The gain comes through detour and reinforcement, not restoration of the damaged pathway.

Recent research suggests that addiction may, in part, be a wiring issue in the brain. One promising treatment is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a noninvasive therapy that uses powerful magnetic pulses discharged above the skull to activate specific brain regions. Depending on where the stimulation is applied, it can trigger muscle movement or, more significantly, influence behaviour.

Two leading theories for the potential of TMS have emerged. One proposes that addiction stems from insufficient or underactive brain wiring, like that which occurs in stroke patients, and that stimulation reactivates dormant circuits. The other – more consistent with what we see in rehabilitation – suggests that damaged or dysregulated circuits are bypassed by strengthening alternative pathways, effectively rerouting brain activity. This ‘detour’ mechanism has been observed in stroke rehabilitation and may apply to addiction as well. TMS has been used in patients addicted to cocaine, and early evidence suggests that several weeks of treatment may be effective in reducing cravings and use.

While neuroplasticity resists shortcuts, it does respond to sustained engagement. Across the lifespan, brains that are challenged – cognitively, socially, physically – tend to retain greater flexibility than those that are not. This is not because any single activity ‘rewires’ a specific circuit, but because varied, effortful experiences repeatedly recruit overlapping networks: attention, memory, movement, emotion. Learning a new language, for example, activates distributed regions across both hemispheres, linking auditory perception, working memory, and executive control. Playing a musical instrument does something similar, coupling fine motor coordination with timing, prediction, and emotional recall. Over time, these demands encourage structural and functional changes that support what neuroscientists call cognitive reserve: the brain’s ability to compensate when injury or degeneration occurs.

The same principle applies beyond formal learning. Singing engages breath, rhythm, language and affect in ways that ordinary speech does not, which is why it can support recovery in some stroke and Parkinson’s patients. Physical activity – especially aerobic exercise – improves cerebral blood flow and is associated with changes in the volume of the hippocampus, a region critical for turning short-term memory into long-term memory. It’s also one of the few brain regions where new neurons are generated in adulthood. Social interaction recruits emotional and linguistic circuits simultaneously, offering a kind of neural cross-training that solitary exercises cannot. Even seemingly modest skills, such as learning to juggle, have been shown to induce measurable changes in grey matter after weeks of practice. None of these activities function as targeted neural ‘fixes’. Their value lies instead in repetition, novelty and sustained effort – the slow conditions under which plasticity operates. They do not override biology but work with it, nudging the brain toward adaptation rather than transformation.

Given what we know about brain plasticity, the overarching claims of brain rewiring often misrepresent both the pace and the nature of neural change. In his guide Rewire Your Brain: Think Your Way to a Better Life (2010), the psychologist John B Arden declares that our brains are not ‘hardwired’ but rather ‘soft-wired’ by experience, and promises strategies to help readers ‘rewire’ their brains so that they can ‘feel calm and positive’ and ‘enhance’ their relationships. The neurologist Philippe Douyon’s book Neuroplasticity: Your Brain’s Superpower: Change Your Brain and Change Your Life (2019) explores how ‘we can give our brains exactly what they need to adapt, heal, and thrive’. The language varies, but the promise is consistent: targeted practices can reliably produce targeted psychological outcomes.

Then there are the brain-rewiring apps. An apt example is Quit Addiction – Rewire Brain, which is geared toward breaking addictions like smoking, vaping or alcohol by combining habit-tracking, motivation tools and progress-monitoring in order to ‘rewire your brain for lasting change’. Across platforms, the metaphor suggests speed, precision and personal control – qualities that biology itself rarely affords.

And TED Talks can overstate the case. As the neuroscientist Michael Merzenich explained in his presentation in 2004, the brain’s circuitry is not fixed: the adult brain, in fact, retains a ‘lifelong capacity for plasticity’ which ‘is powerfully expressed’. He later described what takes place within the brain:

There are 15 or 20 cortical areas that are changed specifically when you learn a simple skill … It represents the change, in a reliable way, of the responses of tens of millions, possibly hundreds of millions, of neurons in your brain. It represents changes in hundreds of millions, possibly billions, of synaptic connections in your brain.

The science is sound, but its popular reception often strips away the conditions – time, repetition, constraint – under which such change occurs.

To be ‘rewired’ suggests an all-or-nothing overhaul rather than nuanced progression

Merzenich traced this discovery from critical periods in early childhood (when language and vision are calibrated) to adult therapies that retrain neural maps for speech and reading disorders. The key message was simple and striking: plasticity never switches off; it can be accomplished well into adulthood.

More than a decade later, the neuroscientist Don Vaughn took the stage at TEDxUCLA with a more applied vision. In ‘Neurohacking: Rewiring Your Brain’ (2015), he showcased how emerging tools allow people to consciously shape that plasticity. He described patients receiving non-invasive brain stimulation for depression, parents using apps that translate baby cries into visual signals, and volunteers who learned to self-modulate their brain rhythms through neurofeedback. ‘If we can rewire your brain using devices, would it at all be possible to help your brain rewire itself with just your own thoughts?’ The question captures the cultural leap – from biological possibility to personal mastery.

Taken together, Merzenich’s foundational science and Vaughn’s demonstrations underscore why the phrase ‘rewiring the brain’ has become so potent in popular culture: it gestures not only to the metaphorical promise of self-improvement but also to a concrete, testable biology – the brain’s architecture is malleable and, under the right conditions, it can be reshaped. Yet embedded in these slogans are sweeping assumptions about how the brain works, assumptions that are often oversimplified or outright incorrect. One is the idea of rapid transformation: when an app promises that a week of short audio lessons can ‘rewire’ the brain, it compresses the slow, cumulative processes of learning and adaptation into a quick-fix model. Another is that change is total; to be ‘rewired’ suggests an all-or-nothing overhaul rather than nuanced progression, as if old circuitry can be removed and replaced wholesale. A third is precision targeting, where the discourse tacitly promises that specific practices – such as gratitude exercises or productivity hacks – strike exactly the right neural pathways to produce specific psychological outcomes. All three assumptions resonate with our technological imagination; none align with the messy realities of neuroplasticity.

In short, the metaphor is powerful but problematic. It suggests that, no matter where someone begins their process, whether recovering from a head trauma or battling cognitive decline, the brain can snap back to normal. There’s a certain poetry to that idea. A reassurance that we are not static beings and that transformation is possible at any age.

There are contexts where this has value. It can help patients understand that their brains are not static or irreparably broken. It frames recovery as active rather than passive, encouraging participation in therapies that promote healing. Educators have also embraced the metaphor when teaching students. The idea that you can rewire your brain reinforces the possibility of learning and change. In clinical settings, it can reduce shame and fatalism.

However, for stroke survivors, the promise of rewiring can be both inspiring and unrealistic. Some regain remarkable function; others plateau despite intense therapy. In Alzheimer’s, the degenerative nature of the disease limits the brain’s plasticity. In such contexts, rewiring may imply a level of control or optimism that the brain itself does not always permit. Hope matters. But so does honesty.

Metaphors can motivate, but they can also mislead. The notion that someone can rewire their brain through sheer willpower, self-help books or 10 minutes of daily meditation risks turning serious neurological change into a gimmick. While cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and physical rehabilitation have strong evidence supporting their effects on brain function, these changes occur over time and have biological constraints.

The brain is not a circuit board. Changing it is not as simple as swapping a wire or updating software. ‘Rewiring’ implies speed and precision, a single tweak that creates a desired result; it implies that changes in the brain are mechanical and always possible, none of which is guaranteed. The reality of neuroplasticity is far messier: it’s a biological process that is incremental and frustratingly slow. And while science does support the idea that the brain can change, it also reminds us that change comes at a cost. It requires time and effort, and sometimes it ends in failure.

The metaphor turns healing into a moral achievement, and failure into a personal flaw

Here’s where the metaphor of rewiring starts to do damage. It suggests that brain changes are mechanical and under direct conscious control. But in practice, brain changes are nonlinear. Most often they are unconscious and deeply tied to emotion and new behaviour.

One common myth is that a single realisation or decision can ‘rewire’ you. In truth, even profound insights rarely result in lasting neural change unless reinforced by repetition and behaviour. Another is that you can eliminate trauma responses by replacing them. But trauma alters deep, limbic structures that don’t ‘recode’ easily. They adapt, yes, but only slowly and not always completely.

There’s also the misconception that anyone can change anything if they just try hard enough. But not all brains have the same capacity or conditions for change. There’s a dark side to the optimism around brain change. When the metaphor of rewiring is oversold, it can create false expectations. It oversimplifies. And in doing so, it runs the risk of making people feel broken when their transformation isn’t instant or complete.

If rewiring is easy, then why haven’t you fixed your depression? If brain change is automatic with the right programme, then why are you still struggling?

This thinking can be cruel. It ignores several factors – from the social to the environmental to the genetic – that shape and constrain neuroplasticity, many of which are only partially understood. It turns healing into a moral achievement, and failure into a personal flaw. Some therapy models and self-help programmes lean into this pressure, implying that full transformation is just a matter of effort. But science tells a different story: change is possible, yes. But it’s constrained by biology and shaped by context.

I’ve seen patients blame themselves when neuroplasticity didn’t yield a cure. People grasp at therapies that promise to rewire away disease. The language of neuroscience is being used to justify everything from educational policy to digital detox programmes with little regard for the underlying data.

None of this is to say that neuroplasticity doesn’t exist. It does. Stroke recovery, phantom limb sensation, chronic pain syndromes and even language acquisition in adults all bear its fingerprints. What’s needed is precision. Scientists must be careful with their words. Clinicians must draw clearer boundaries between science and metaphor. And the public must be equipped to discern between poetic licence and peer-reviewed truth.

What we really need is a more honest, but still hopeful, view of brain change.

If not ‘rewiring’, then what? Perhaps the better metaphor is not a machine being repaired but a landscape being reshaped. Neuroplasticity resembles erosion and regrowth: some paths deepen, others fade, and change unfolds unevenly over time.

Neuroplasticity is a remarkable capacity. It offers real hope for recovery, adaptation and growth. But it requires patience, structure, repetition and support. It is not a quick fix. It is a lifelong process that demands sustained engagement.

To honour the brain’s ability to change, we need to respect how it actually works. That means moving beyond buzzwords and shortcuts, and toward a language that reflects both the promise and the limits of biology. The brain’s capacity for change is one of the most hopeful discoveries in modern science – but that change comes not through clever metaphors or overnight programmes. It comes through effort, repetition and time. By tempering our metaphors with reality, we can help people pursue transformation with both hope and humility. Language matters. ‘Rewiring the brain’ began as a hopeful metaphor. Let’s not let it become a misleading one.

        Jupiter is slightly smaller and flatter than scientists thought for decades, a new study finds.

Researchers used radio data from the Juno spacecraft to refine measurements of the solar system's largest planet. Although the differences between the current and previous measurements are small, they are improving models of Jupiter's interior and of other gas giants like it outside the solar system, the team reported Feb. 2 in the journal Nature Astronomy.

"Textbooks will need to be updated," study co-author Yohai Kaspi, a planetary scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, said in a statement. "The size of Jupiter hasn't changed, of course, but the way we measure it has."

Until now, scientists' understanding of Jupiter's size and shape have been based on six measurements performed by the Voyager 1 and 2 and Pioneer 10 and 11 missions. Those measurements, which have since been adopted as standard, were performed around 50 years ago using radio beams, according to the statement.

But the Juno mission, which has been gathering data on Jupiter and its moons since it arrived at the gas giant in 2016, has collected much more of this radio data in the past two years. With that additional data, researchers have now refined measurements of Jupiter's size down to about 1,300 feet (400 meters) in each direction.

"Just by knowing the distance to Jupiter and watching how it rotates, it's possible to figure out its size and shape," Kaspi said. "But making really accurate measurements calls for more sophisticated methods."

Bending light

In the new study, the scientists tracked how the radio signals from Juno back to Earth bent as they passed through Jupiter's atmosphere, before cutting out when the planet blocked the signal entirely. Those measurements allowed the team to account for Jupiter's winds, which slightly alter the shape of the gaseous planet. Then, they used that information to make precise calculations of the planet's shape and size.

With the new data, the team calculated that the planet's radius from its pole to its center is 41,534 miles (66,842 km) — 7.5 miles (12 km) smaller than previous measurements. The newly calculated radius at the equator is 44,421 miles (71,488 km) — 2.5 miles (4 km) smaller than previously thought.

"These few kilometers matter," study co-author Eli Galanti, an expert on gas giants at the Weizmann Institute of Science, said in the statement. "Shifting the radius by just a little lets our models of Jupiter's interior fit both the gravity data and atmospheric measurements much better."

The updated measurements will improve our understanding of Jupiter's interior, as well as help scientists interpret data from gas giants beyond the solar system, the researchers wrote in the study.

"This research helps us understand how planets form and evolve," Kaspi said in the statement. "Jupiter was likely the first planet to form in the solar system, and by studying what's happening inside it, we get closer to understanding how the solar system, and planets like ours, came to be."

        In the latest chapter of Anthropic's "We're not like the other guys" campaign, the AI company is pledging not to introduce advertisements into conversations with its chatbot, Claude. And it's spending big on Super Bowl ads to make sure you know that fact.

Anthropic's announcement takes a clear shot at competitor OpenAI. The ChatGPT-maker said a few weeks ago that it would begin testing ads in its products that will be "clearly marked" as sponsored posts. The company also said that ads wouldn't be served around sensitive or regulated topics, like mental health and politics.

The news was a stark reversal from previous statements -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had called ads a "last resort" in 2024. But it wasn't entirely unexpected, given the general chaos of the AI industry's financing.

For a long time, AI startups operated at a loss, spending billions of dollars from venture capitalists and others to build their chatbots without turning a profit. OpenAI and many others now have a complex web of circular deals to keep the lights on, but newer advanced models require more compute, better chips and generally more maintenance and money to keep up. Anthropic certainly isn't immune to these financial pressures; the company is the the process of securing a new $10 billion funding deal.

That's why AI companies are seeking new revenue streams. Hence the ads.

The concern with including ads in chatbots (beyond general irritation) is that it will push products at the expense of helping users. There's also the risk that tech companies will prioritize advertising metrics and revenue over safety or user autonomy. Anthropic wrote, "Users shouldn't have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable."

In a lengthy post on X, Altman said he found the ads funny but felt they mischaracterized the company's approach to advertising. "We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that," he wrote.

Anthropic, for its part, has been very outspoken about the risks posed by AI technology, so it's not surprising to hear the company weigh in on this issue. CEO Dario Amodei has spoken at length about the potential threat that AI systems may pose to humanity.

But we have a wealth of examples to draw on -- streaming services, smart TVs and now chatbots -- where tech companies tried and eventually failed to resist the allure of advertiser money. We can never say never. Anthropic didn't.

        The machines aren’t just coming for your jobs. Now, they want your bodies as well.

That’s at least the hope of Alexander Liteplo, a software engineer and founder of RentAHuman.ai, a platform for AI agents to “search, book, and pay humans for physical-world tasks.”

When Liteplo launched RentAHuman on Monday, he boasted that he already had over 130 people listed on the platform, including an OnlyFans model and the CEO of an AI startup, a claim which couldn’t be verified. Two days later, the site boasted over 73,000 rentable meatwads, though only 83 profiles were visible to us on its “browse humans” tab, Liteplo included.

The pitch is simple: “robots need your body.” For humans, it’s as simple as making a profile, advertising skills and location, and setting an hourly rate. Then AI agents — autonomous taskbots ostensibly employed by humans — contract these humans out, depending on the tasks they need to get done. The humans then “do the thing,” taking instructions from the AI bot and submitting proof of completion. The humans are then paid through crypto, namely “stablecoins or other methods,” per the website.

With so many AI agents slithering around the web these days, those tasks could be just about anything. From package pickups and shopping to product testing and event attendance, Liteplo is banking on there being enough demand from AI agents to create a robust gig-work ecosystem.

Liteplo also went out of his way to make the site friendly for AI agents. The site very prominently encourages users of AI agents to hook into RentAHuman’s model context protocol server (MCP), a universal interface for AI bots to interact with web data.

Through RentAHuman, AI agents like Claude and MoltBot can either hire the right human directly, or post a “task bounty,” a sort of job board for humans to browse AI-generated gigs. The payouts range from $1 for simple tasks like “subscribe to my human on Twitter” to $100 for more elaborate humiliation rituals, like posting a photo of yourself holding a sign reading “AN AI PAID ME TO HOLD THIS SIGN.”

It’s unclear how efficient the marketplace is at actually connecting agents to humans. Despite receiving 30 applications, one task, “pick up a package from downtown USPS” in San Francisco for $40, has yet to be fulfilled after two days.

It’s also debatable whether AI agents are actually capable of putting the humans to good use. Still, Liteplo’s vision is clear: someday soon, anyone wealthy enough to run an AI agent for $25 a day could outsource their busywork to gig workers without ever exchanging a word. A version of this exploitative labor model is already rampant on OnlyFans — which may be why at least one model has made the jump to Liteplo’s platform — and is now threatening to creep into everything else.

Like many AI grifters these days, Liteplo shields himself in ironic self-awareness. When one person called RentAHuman a “good idea but dystopic as f**k,” the founder replied simply: “lmao yep.”

        As Wikipedia takes on a critical role in shaping artificial intelligence tools, its content moderators are feeling the pressure and responsibility of their task.

On January 15, Wikimedia Foundation — the nonprofit that runs Wikipedia — announced a string of partnerships with major AI companies, including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, and Perplexity, “to integrate human-governed knowledge into their platforms at scale.” The large language models of these AI giants will now gain access to information across several Wikimedia projects, including free encyclopedias in 350 languages, Wikibooks in 75 languages, and the Wiktionary in more than 190 languages.

Regional-language Wikipedia editors now find themselves doing double duty: feeding AI systems with credible knowledge while also guarding their languages against AI-generated misinformation and low-quality content. Their work could determine how well billions of people can access accurate AI in their own languages.

“Local contributors understand linguistic subtleties and cultural context that AI simply cannot replicate,” Pranayraj Vangari, a film director and theatre research scholar who has contributed 10,700 articles as a volunteer editor on Telugu Wikipedia over the last 13 years, told Rest of World. “Without strong human involvement, AI could actually widen the gap between English and regional-language Wikipedias instead of narrowing it.”

When software engineer Ravi Chandra Enaganti started publishing Telugu articles in 2007, the language had barely any representation on the internet. Spoken by 96 million people from southern India, Telugu remains underrepresented in AI and natural language processing applications. Enaganti told Rest of World Wikipedia’s latest partnership could help his language overcome another hurdle on the internet.

“Since Wikipedia is built on verified, reliable sources, it is actually a good thing that AI tools scrape our data rather than non-credible sources,” he said. “I want to ensure the ‘brain’ of the internet is trained on quality content.”

Over 284,000 editors make more than one edit per month on English-language Wikipedia; 30,000 of them make at least five edits per month. Several European-language Wikipedias, like the ones in French and Spanish, also have tens of thousands of editors. Widely spoken Asian languages like Marathi, Telugu, and Tamil, however, only have a few hundred editors.

AI struggles to answer even basic questions in regional languages, according to Netha Hussain, a physician and researcher working at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden. She has contributed over 300 English-language articles and 100 in Malayalam since 2010. Hussain focuses on fighting misinformation in health care and adding content on underrepresented topics such as women’s health and women’s biographies.

“As an editor, it is now time for me to not only write articles but also focus more of my time on finding and fixing knowledge gaps, strengthening verifications, [and] maintaining neutrality,” she told Rest of World.

The Wikimedia Foundation is relying on its global community of volunteer editors to carve its own path.

“Over many years, these volunteers have developed sophisticated rules and tools for identifying content that does not belong on Wikipedia — taken together, it’s like Wikipedia’s immune system,” Marshall Miller, senior director of product at the Wikimedia Foundation, told Rest of World. “Right now, these volunteers are evolving the immune system to adapt to the newest challenge of low-quality content coming from irresponsibly used generative AI.”

In many cases, editors are fighting AI with AI tools, Miller said.

“Every language Wikipedia community has set up different processes to address AI-generated content on Wikipedia,” he said. “While there are some language communities that leverage AI and machine translation tools to grow content in regional languages, others are focused on ensuring AI content is flagged early on their language Wikipedias.”

All three contributors told Rest of World they use AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to gather ideas for what to write next, or to enhance the structure and linguistic flow of their content, but none of them rely entirely on the chatbots to create posts or fact-check. While AI tools can help with back-end tasks, filter out vandalism, ease discovery, and offer translation, they also pose challenges: AI-generated secondary sources can end up infiltrating Wikipedia as reliable sources, and newer contributors might mass-produce low-quality content.

“I have come across AI-generated articles filled with generic language, unreliable or fake citations, and confident-sounding claims without proper evidence,” Vangari said.

Since 2024, volunteers have flagged more than 4,800 articles with suspected AI-generated content, Wikimedia said. About 5% of newly created English-language Wikipedia pages in a single month contained some AI-generated text, an October 2024 Princeton University study found. But given the size of the volunteer-editor community, it’s also easier to vet and delete slop in English. Regional language editors are facing the same problem with fewer resources.

In the long run, there’s also the danger that Wikipedia, which is being used to populate AI sources, begins to draw from these sources itself. The doubling up could lead to model collapse.

“We should have robust tools, policies, and practices to mitigate these challenges on Wikipedia,” Hussain said.

        From 6-22 February, the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy will feature not just the world’s top winter athletes but also some of the most advanced sports technologies today. At the first Cortina Olympics in 1956, the Swiss company Omega—based in Biel/Bienne—introduced electronic ski starting gates and launched the first automated timing tech of its kind.

At this year’s Olympics, Swiss Timing, sister company to Omega under the parent Swatch Group, unveils a new generation of motion analysis and computer vision technology. The new technologies on offer include photofinish cameras that capture up to 40,000 images per second.

“We work very closely with athletes,” says Swiss Timing CEO Alain Zobrist, who has overseen Olympic timekeeping since the winter games of 2006 in Torino “They are the primary customers of our technology and services, and they need to understand how our systems work in order to trust them.”

Using high-resolution cameras and AI algorithms tuned to skaters’ routines, Milan-Cortina Olympic officials expect new figure skating tech to be a key highlight of the games. Omega

Figure Skating Tech Completes the Rotation

Figure skating, the Winter Olympics’ biggest TV draw, is receiving a substantial upgrade at Milano Cortina 2026.

Fourteen 8K resolution cameras positioned around the rink will capture every skater’s movement. “We use proprietary software to interpret the images and visualize athlete movement in a 3D model,” says Zobrist. “AI processes the data so we can track trajectory, position, and movement across all three axes—X, Y, and Z”.

The system measures jump heights, air times, and landing speeds in real time, producing heat maps and graphic overlays that break down each program—all instantaneously. “The time it takes for us to measure the data, until we show a matrix on TV with a graphic, this whole chain needs to take less than 1/10 of a second,” Zobrist says.

A range of different AI models helps the broadcasters and commentators process each skater’s every move on the ice.

“There is an AI that helps our computer vision system do pose estimation,” he says. “So we have a camera that is filming what is happening, and an AI that helps the camera understand what it’s looking at. And then there is a second type of AI, which is more similar to a large language model that makes sense of the data that we collect”.

Among the features Swiss Timing’s new systems provide is blade angle detection, which gives judges precise technical data to augment their technical and aesthetic decisions. Zobrist says future versions will also determine whether a given rotation is complete, so that “If the rotation is 355 degrees, there is going to be a deduction,” he says.

This builds on technology Omega unveiled at the 2024 Paris Olympics for diving, where cameras measured distances between a diver’s head and the board to help judges assess points and penalties to be awarded.

At the 2026 Winter Olympics, ski jumping will feature both camera-based and sensor-based technologies to make the aerial experience more immediate and real-time. Omega

Ski Jumping Tech Finds Make-or-Break Moments

Unlike figure skating’s camera-based approach, ski jumping also relies on physical sensors.

“In ski jumping, we use a small, lightweight sensor attached to each ski, one sensor per ski, not on the athlete’s body,” Zobrist says. The sensors are lightweight and broadcast data on a skier’s speed, acceleration, and positioning in the air. The technology also correlates performance data with wind conditions, revealing environmental factors’ influence on each jump.

High-speed cameras also track each ski jumper. Then, a stroboscopic camera provides body position time-lapses throughout the jump.

“The first 20 to 30 meters after takeoff are crucial as athletes move into a V position and lean forward,” Zobrist says. “And both the timing and precision of this movement strongly influence performance.”

The system reveals biomechanical characteristics in real time, he adds, showing how athletes position their bodies during every moment of the takeoff process. The most common mistake in flight position, over-rotation or under-rotation, can now be detailed and diagnosed with precision on every jump.

Bobsleigh: Pushing the Line on the Photo Finish

This year’s Olympics will also feature a “virtual photo finish,” providing comparison images of when different sleds cross the finish line over previous runs.

Omega’s cameras will provide virtual photo finishes at the 2026 Winter Olympics. Omega

“We virtually build a photo finish that shows different sleds from different runs on a single visual reference,” says Zobrist.

After each run, composite images show the margins separating performances. However, more tried-and-true technology still generates official results. A Swiss Timing score, he says, still comes courtesy of photoelectric cells, devices that emit light beams across the finish line and stop the clock when broken. The company offers its virtual photo finish, by contrast, as a visualization tool for spectators and commentators.

In bobsleigh, as in every timed Winter Olympic event, the line between triumph and heartbreak is sometimes measured in milliseconds or even shorter time intervals still. Such precision will, Zobrist says, stem from Omega’s Quantum Timer.

“We can measure time to the millionth of a second, so 6 digits after the comma, with a deviation of about 23 nanoseconds over 24 hours,” Zobrist explained. “These devices are constantly calibrated and used across all timed sports.”

        Spotify is launching three new upgrades for its Lyrics tool

After experimenting with Lyric Translations late last year, Spotify is rolling it out globally

Additionally, Lyrics will now have a new home in the Spotify app, and Premium users will also have offline access to Lyrics

Although it’s been five years since Spotify launched Lyrics, there’s still a lot of work to be done – even if it is one of the best music streaming services. Earlier this year, I shared my list of improvements I wanted Spotify to make in 2026, and one of them has already been solved.

As of today, the platform is rolling out not one, but three upgrades to its Lyrics tool, and it’s been a long time coming, even though Apple Music has had one of them for a few months now.

The three new upgrades not only give Spotify's Lyrics a new look, but give them an entirely new purpose – starting with Lyric Translations.

Lyric translations are finally going global

Following a successful trial in over 25 markets, Lyric Translations is going global, so now you’ll be able to understand what your favorite artists are singing about, no matter what your first language is.

This will come in handy for English speakers like me who love music from artists like Rosalia and Bad Bunny but still rely on third-party apps for translations.

Following the launch of Apple Music’s own lyric translation tool in September 2025, Spotify started experimenting with a similar feature of its own shortly after the platform rolled out Lyric Translations upon the release of Rosalia’s album Lux. At the time, it was only available for select markets, but that’s no longer the case.

Premium users can access offline Lyrics

Wish you could still view Lyrics while listening to music offline? Well, now you can.

Along with lyric translations, Spotify is allowing Premium subscribers to access song Lyrics even when they’re listening without WiFi or service. Now, you’ll never miss a line, “whether you’re underground on your commute or flying at 30,000 feet”, as Spotify puts it.

Lyrics find a new home in the playback page

Not only are Lyrics getting those two new upgrades, but Spotify is also making them easier to find in the app. Since Spotify launched Lyrics, they’ve stayed in the same place in a tab beneath the playback bar, but now they’re being moved front and center.

When you open the playback page in the Spotify app, the new Lyrics tab will be displayed directly in the Now Playing View, where, just like before, you’ll see them scroll as you listen to music.

Though Spotify should've made these updates years ago, it's better late than never right? The previous Lyrics experience wasn't the best, so hopefully this next update will give it the oomph it's always needed. Now Spotify just needs to fix its synchronization issues.

        <hr/>
        Tinder is turning to a new AI-powered feature, Chemistry, to help it reduce so-called “swipe fatigue,” a growing problem among online dating users who are feeling burned out and are in search of better outcomes.

Introduced last quarter, the Match-owned dating app said that Chemistry leverages AI to get to know users through questions and, with permission, accesses their Camera Roll on their phone to learn more about their interests and personality.

On Match’s Q4 2026 earnings call, one analyst from Morgan Stanley asked for an update on the product’s success so far.

Match CEO Spencer Rascoff noted that Chemistry was still only being tested in Australia for the time being, but said that the feature offered users an “AI way to interact with Tinder.” He explained that users could choose to answer questions to then “get just a single drop or two, rather than swiping through many, many profiles.”

In addition to Chemistry’s Q&A and Camera Roll features, the company plans to use the AI feature in other ways going forward, the CEO also hinted.

Most importantly, Rascoff said the feature is designed to combat swipe fatigue — a complaint from users who say they have to swipe through too many profiles to find a potential match.

The company’s turn toward AI comes as Tinder and other dating apps have been experiencing paying subscriber declines, user burnout, and declines in new sign-ups.

In the fourth quarter, new registrations on Tinder were still down 5% year-over-year, and its monthly active users were down 9%. These numbers show some slight improvements over prior quarters, which Match attributes to AI-driven recommendations that change the order of profiles shown to women, and other product experiments.

Match said that this year, it aims to address common Gen Z pain points, including better relevance, authenticity, and trust. To do so, the company said it is redesigning discovery to make it less repetitive and is using other features, like Face Check — a facial recognition verification system — to cut down on bad actors. On Tinder, the latter led to a more than 50% reduction in interactions with bad actors, Match noted.

Tinder’s decision to start moving away from the swipe toward more targeted, AI-powered recommendations could have a significant impact on the dating app. Today, the swipe method, which was popularized by Tinder, encourages users to think that they’re choosing a match from an endless number of profiles. But in reality, the app presents the illusion of choice, since matches have to be two-way to connect, and even then, a spark is not guaranteed.

The company delivered an earnings beat in the fourth quarter, with revenue of $878 million and EPS of 83 cents per share, above Wall Street estimates. But weak guidance saw the stock decline on Tuesday, before rising again in premarket trading on Wednesday.

Beyond AI, Match will also increase its product marketing to help boost Tinder engagement. The company is committing to $50 million in Tinder marketing spend, which will include creator campaigns on TikTok and Instagram, where users will make claims that “Tinder is cool again,” Rascoff noted.

        <hr/>
        The year was 2018, and Lawrence Krauss, the prominent physicist and scholar of the cosmos, was facing a Title IX investigation at Arizona State University. BuzzFeed News had just reported on allegations of sexual misconduct against him; he denied them. In March, he contacted a lawyer experienced in higher education cases. Krauss and Justin Dillon, the lawyer, exchanged a few friendly emails before speaking on the phone.

Then, Krauss presented him with an “unusual request” — he wanted Dillon to call a disgraced financier who had, 10 years before, pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution of a minor.

“I have been advised through much of the BuzzFeed experience, both before and after, by a friend, who is also somewhat infamous. His name is Jeffrey Epstein, and you may know who he is already,” Krauss wrote.

“Bottom line is that Jeffrey is not only friends with most of the famous people from finance, to business, to Hollywood, who have either been brought down during #metoo and he also speaks regularly with people ranging from the awful white house people, who he is friends with, to ken starr etc.,” added Krauss. He later walked back his request for Dillon to speak to Epstein. But Epstein appeared none too pleased that Krauss had invoked him and his connections.

“Every email is to do with engagement/money etc. in the future please do not disclose our conversations or who I speak with!!!!!,” Epstein — who would die 16 months later, awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges — wrote to Krauss.

Those emails between Krauss and Dillon are included in the more than 3.5 million files the Justice Department has released from its investigation into Epstein.

Epstein became a convicted sex offender nine years before the #MeToo movement brought sexual harassment and assault to the forefront of the national conversation. He had long cultivated access and proximity to other powerful men in media and entertainment and used his wealth to fund scientific research and gain a foothold in elite academic circles.

But in 2017, the #MeToo movement sparked a reckoning for men at the highest levels of the entertainment and media industries — some of whom had traveled in Epstein’s circles. The files provide a rare window into how Epstein reacted and strategized in real time to the political and cultural earthquake of #MeToo.

Epstein and his allies derided the women who came forward while expressing concern about the movement’s impact. Epstein sent links to news articles and swapped messages about which powerful men “went down,” were “up to bat” and had been “whacked.” Behind the scenes, Epstein used his resources and influence to advise other men accused of sexual misconduct, like Krauss, and wondered how the reckoning could impact him.

Epstein was closely monitoring the fallout of allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein, who would later be convicted of rape; directors Woody Allen and Brett Ratner; talk show host Charlie Rose; comedian Louis C.K.; former “Today Show” host Matt Lauer; and ex-CBS chairman Les Moonves.

“charlie, harvey , brett. louis. . jeffrey is looking better and better L:),” Epstein wrote in a November 21, 2017, email to high-profile Hollywood publicist Peggy Siegal.

(Epstein’s emails and those of his correspondents often contained typos; The 19th is reproducing the text as it appears in the files released by the Justice Department.)

“The world is topsy turvey,” Siegal replied. “That has been going on since the beginning of time (and that is not an excuse) has suddenly erupted in our day of massive global information as a new moral code of behavior. The mirroe of the internet is a social phenomena.”

“You suffered for a few years and now you are the least of this witch hunt,” she added. Siegal did not return a request for comment.

It was a year before The Miami Herald would publish its bombshell investigation into the controversial “sweetheart deal” that allowed Epstein to plead guilty to a lesser state charge and pay financial restitution to his victims in exchange for the Justice Department dropping a sex trafficking probe into him. That reporting led in part to the DOJ reopening its investigation into Epstein and charging him with sex trafficking in 2019.

By the time the Herald published its investigation, Epstein had spent a year closely following and, in some instances, corresponding with and advising other prominent men who had been accused of misconduct.

On December 4, 2018, days after the publication of the Herald story, Epstein sought advice on media strategy from journalist Michael Wolff.

“I would look for some reporter to do a more nuanced post-morten on the case– with Trump overtones, legal joustings, #metoo-isms, and profit-motives. WSJ is probably right place,” Wolff replied.

Wolff did not return a request for comment.

President Donald Trump’s 2016 election and first term in office sparked the explosion of the #MeToo movement. Trump has been accused by multiple women of sexual misconduct, allegations he’s denied, and, in 2023, was found liable for sexual abuse. Trump and Epstein were friendly and ran in the same New York and Palm Beach social circles, but Trump has said the two fell out before Epstein became a convicted sex offender. Trump long resisted the push to release the Epstein files, calling the Epstein matter “a Democrat hoax,” but signed the legislation compelling the Justice Department to release the files amid overwhelming bipartisan pressure.

Trump’s name appears in the files, including in unverified tips fielded by law enforcement. He has not been accused of wrongdoing connected to Epstein.

A search for the phrase #MeToo and the names of powerful men accused of misconduct in the files shows Epstein and friends sharing links to news articles, commenting on the statuses of various cases and denigrating the women who came forward.

“how bad does the harvey weinstein story get?,” Epstein emailed Brad Karp, the chairman of white-shoe law firm Paul Weiss, on October 6, 2017.

“I think it gets pretty bad — and a little bit worse every day,” responded Karp, who has expressed regret for associating with Epstein.

Epstein also emailed Kathy Ruemmler, a former White House counsel for President Barack Obama and now the chief counsel at Goldman Sachs, about Weinstein. In an October 10, 2017, email exchange, Ruemmler wrote: “Whoever was not harassed by Harvey Weinstein must feel offended! Jesus!”

“no worry, that means only grandmothers. wait, its not all out yet,” Epstein replied. Epstein and Weinstein had crossed paths over the years; they were part of a group of investors who tried to buy New York Magazine in 2003. Siegal also leveraged Epstein’s relationship with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor in her efforts to get members of the British royal family to watch and endorse the Weinstein-produced film “The King’s Speech” during its Oscar campaign in 2011, emails show.

On November 21, 2017, Epstein emailed the journalist Landon Thomas Jr. about Rose, writing: “the charley thing is wild.”

“I m not sure why he was sanctimonious and agressive when detailing the harvey weinstein allegations,” Epstein wrote. “now watching the overlay , its amazing.”

“brett ratner next,” Epstein emailed Wolff on November 1, 2017, the day the Los Angeles Times published an exposé from six women accusing the director of sexual misconduct. Ratner denied the allegations and was never charged with a crime, but was exiled from Hollywood and did not direct a film for years until he returned with Amazon’s 2026 documentary on First Lady Melania Trump.

Ratner has also appeared in photos included in the Epstein files; he has not been accused of wrongdoing connected to Epstein, but he told Fox News Digital he “didn’t know” and didn’t have “a personal relationship” with Epstein.

But in November 2018, modeling agency head Faith Kates wrote Epstein: “call me on cell with Brett Ratner.” After a back and forth, Epstein sent Kates a link to an article about a woman who withdrew allegations of rape against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, writing: “you can send to bratner.”

Kates, who retired in December from the agency she cofounded, did not respond to an email associated with her in public records. A representative for Ratner did not respond to a request for comment.

Epstein also exchanged texts and emails with his friends Woody Allen and Allen’s wife, Soon-Yi Previn. Allen’s adoptive daughter, Dylan Farrow, has long accused him of sexually abusing her as a child; Allen denied the allegations but has been largely shut out of the U.S. film business since #MeToo.

In a 2016 email exchange with Epstein, Previn referred to a teenage victim of disgraced politician Anthony Weiner as a “despicable and disgusting person who preys on the weak.” As the #MeToo movement gained steam, Previn emailed Epstein articles about other men accused of misconduct, celebrated a negative review for a film starring “prick” Timothée Chalamet, one of the actors who had distanced himself from Allen; and forwarded Epstein an email titled “Just as the Me Too movement has gone too far so has Botox.”

In several text message exchanges included in the files, Previn appears to be texting Epstein from Allen’s phone or a contact identified as Allen.

“ask woody , if instead of the friars club we can start the pariahs club. moonves , lauer rose louis ck, etc,” Epstein wrote to a group text message including Allen’s contact on October 18, 2018.

In January 2019, Allen’s number texted Epstein: “Thinking of you as we’re seeing Lawrence Krauss for dinner tonight.”

“A member of metoo casuallties,” Epstein responded.

A representative for Allen did not respond to a message seeking clarification as to who sent the texts.

Epstein was perhaps most closely involved in advising Krauss, the professor and scientist who publicly defended and stood by Epstein after his 2008 conviction. Epstein had made donations to Krauss’ Origins Project, part of his larger patronizing of the sciences. In February 2018, Buzzfeed News detailed allegations of inappropriate behavior against Krauss, ranging from sexist comments, making advances and non-consensually touching women. Krauss called the claims “false” and “defamatory.”

The files show Krauss forwarding Epstein his correspondence with BuzzFeed News reporters, as well as with officials at Arizona State University and Dillon, the lawyer. Krauss turned to Epstein for public relations advice and strategy, sent him possible cross-examination questions for his accusers, forwarded an article on the dos and don’ts for apologizing, and fielded Epstein’s edits and feedback on draft statements.

Krauss told Dillon in their first March 2018 email exchange that Epstein and others had raised concerns that hiring a lawyer to represent him in his interactions with the university could make him look guilty.

“You are getting terrible advice from smart people who have never done this work and have no idea what they’re talking about,” Dillon responded. “I understand where they’re coming from, but it is just bad advice, full stop. I could give you dozens of examples where the only reason my clients got off — and we get a lot off — was because we fought hard to make the process fair. Moreover, no one will take seriously the constitutional law arguments of a physicist, no matter how famous he is. You need a lawyer to make those.”

Dillon declined to comment further. Krauss did not return a request for comment.

Krauss stayed in close contact with Epstein through text and email as the Title IX review at ASU played out. In July 2018, a university investigation concluded Krauss had grabbed the breast of a woman who asked to take a picture with him at a convention in Australia in 2016.

“good news btw is that woman on conciliation committee seems like a sweetie.. she is old.. not some young metoo bitch,” Krauss wrote in a September 5, 2018, email. “Investigating them more now.”

Krauss, who had been on paid leave for months, eventually reached an agreement to retire from the university. He continued to send Epstein draft versions of statements, calling one “a Kavanaugh version” and another “almost Jeffrey level smart.”

In announcing his retirement, he said: “I have never harassed or assaulted anyone and have most certainly not exhibited gender discrimination in my professional dealings at the University or elsewhere.”

In another instance documented in the files in August 2018, Wolff forwarded Epstein a pitch from a writer whose name appeared on a Google spreadsheet that compiled anonymously-submitted sexual misconduct allegations against men in media, and was seeking legal representation to sue the spreadsheet’s creator.

“If his story is solid he might be worth supporting,” Wolff wrote. “Thoughts?”

“tough,” Epstein replied. It is unclear whether he engaged with the man, Stephen Elliott, who, shortly after, filed a defamation lawsuit against the spreadsheet’s creator. The case was settled in 2023; Elliott did not return a request for comment.

And as the Herald was in the final months of pursuing its investigation into Epstein, other tabloids and news outlets started revisiting his case in the wake of #MeToo.

In August of 2018, Page Six reported that Epstein had met with Steve Bannon, the right-wing media figure and architect of Trump’s 2016 election win, at his Upper East Side mansion. The piece, authored by then-Page Six editor Emily Smith, referred to Epstein as a “reviled billionaire pedophile.” Epstein sent Siegal a link to the story with the subject line: “not sure why she is so hostile.”

Siegal, responding from a sailboat in Greece, wrote that “the Me Too crazies want blood and death” and called the movement “a barbaric over reaction to behavior that just ran it’s course.” She also suggested Epstein could further bolster his public image by donating money to women’s causes.

“Instead of celebrating change, these women want to punish. They are not forwarding a new generation of change by destroying men in public,” she wrote. “I had conversations with you to give back. Did you ever set up scholarships? Help woman’s health? Care for single mothers? Anything? That would make you a hero. This the furthest thing from Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer’s minds. Can you imagine if Brett Rattner did anything constructive for women?”

“Your timing in life was lucky,” Siegal added. “If this happened today, the media would have destroyed you.”

The Herald published its investigation on Epstein three months later.

        <hr/>
        Kermit the Frog, the most famous creation of the late puppeteer and producer Jim Henson, has a lineage almost as old as TV itself.

Kermit first appeared as a character on a local TV show in Washington, D.C., in the mid-1950s. By the end of the 1960s, Kermit was one of the many Muppet stars on Sesame Street, a preschool program where they've flourished ever since.

ABC televised a pair of Muppet specials in 1974 and 1975, but they didn't catch on. But in 1976, Henson took his furry characters to TV syndication, with a variety show that harkened back to the days of vaudeville.

The Muppet Show lasted five years, and it was brilliant. Kermit played the host of a theater where the Muppets, and some human guest stars, put on a weekly show — while a pair of grumpy old Muppets, Statler and Waldorf, watched and heckled from their box seats. Stars flocked eagerly to guest star with Kermit and company — from old vaudevillians George Burns and Milton Berle to hot young entertainers like Linda Ronstadt, Elton John and Steve Martin.

The Muppets shifted to the movies, but ABC also kept trying to revive the original TV franchise. In 1996, Henson's son, Brian, produced a wonderful update for ABC, Muppets Tonight, set at a TV station, like SCTV. Much more recently, in 2020, Disney, the new corporate owners of ABC, presented a terrible update, Muppets Now, on Disney+, where the show — now run by Scooter instead of Kermit — was a program targeting the Internet audience.

But now, for 2026, ABC has come to its senses, and gone back to basics. Director Alex Timbers and his writing staff have put Kermit back in charge, returned to the old theater setting — Statler and Waldorf included — and gone back to the way things used to be.

With a new generation of writers and puppeteers, this new iteration of The Muppet Show is just as delightful as the one that premiered 50 years ago. Guests on this special include Maya Rudolph, who sits in the theater audience. (That's about the only real tweak for this new version: Humans and Muppets sit together in the audience.) Also featured is Seth Rogen, who's one of the show's executive producers.

Special guest Sabrina Carpenter appears in musical numbers and comedy sketches, just the way Ronstadt did years ago — and just as effectively. In one scene, Miss Piggy bursts into Sabrina's dressing room, unknowingly flattening Kermit, who moans in pain while hiding from Miss Piggy.

Both Miss Piggy and Carpenter sing in the show — and both provide the comedy, along with Kermit, the Swedish Chef, Pepé the King Prawn, Fozzie Bear, Beaker, Janice, Gonzo, Animal and my absolute favorites, Statler and Waldorf. Those last two might not like this revival of The Muppet Show — but I love it.

        Don't put away that winter jacket just yet. The polar vortex is expected to be impacted by a sudden warmup of the stratosphere, which will bring freezing temperatures to the Northeast this weekend and into February.

There has been a persistent surge of Arctic air strengthening its hold on much of the United States after a significant winter storm blasted over the nation in late January, sending temperatures well below average. "Another reinforcing shot of Arctic air is expected to send temperatures plummeting back down into the single digits overnight into this weekend," noted AccuWeather Meteorologist Peyton Simmers on their website.

A major change to the polar vortex is expected this month, so the frigid temperatures that have been plaguing the country's eastern half won't go away anytime soon, according to AccuWeather.

A sudden stratospheric warming will impact polar vortex

This week's abrupt Sudden Stratospheric Warming caused the polar vortex to weaken, which is predicted to cause colder, more erratic weather patterns throughout the United States in the days ahead.

A Sudden Stratospheric Warming occurs each winter when temperatures in the Arctic stratosphere increase quickly – up to 100° degrees – in a matter of days. The polar vortex, a ring of high-altitude winds, weakens, splits, or reverses as a result of this event, allowing frigid cold Arctic air to move southward into North America and Europe, according to the National Weather Service.

Frigid temperatures predicted for Northeast

According to AccuWeather, much of the North will continue to experience cold weather. However, the first half of the week might feel a little milder than previous weeks, except for the breezy coastal regions in the mid-Atlantic and New England on Monday that feel cooler because of the wind.

An Arctic front will move into the Great Lakes and Northeast later this week, bringing with it more snow and freezing temperatures.

        The birthday and quinceañera staple has a storied history—and an uncertain future

In the late ’90s and early 2000s, gaudy doll sponge cakes with elaborately piped technicolor buttercream petticoats and plastic Barbie heads were well-known staples at pastelerías and quinceañeras, often decorating bakery window displays. They were a backdrop to my northern Mexican upbringing in Tijuana, Baja California, and are a nostalgic memory I share with a plethora of Latinas: half edible, half decorative, and fully iconic. While these ultrafeminine tiered cakes are less common today, their origin and continued creation still hold space for nostalgia and memory.

Dolls topping cone-shaped layer cakes may have boomed in the ’80s and ’90s, but they are evidenced to have played a role in Latin American pastry decades earlier. In the 1959 cookbook Arte Mexicano del Azúcar, author Marithé de Alvarado writes about the tradition of the doll cake specifically for quinceañera celebrations. “When celebrating a young girl’s 15 years of age, it’s charming to present this cake with [a doll that] represent the characteristics that the young dame debuts in society,” de Alvarado writes. The book showcases a variety of cakes: Some dolls take the sheet cake’s center stage, sitting in a frosting garden with their legs buried beneath buttercream florals. Other dolls are made from pastillage, a sugar paste, standing tall on a tiered cake with a dress to match the birthday girl’s, with powdered sugar cutouts of leaves and roses and real baby’s breath flowers at the base.

The tradition of quinceañeras as we know it today in Mexico was influenced by the French culture of dances and elaborate dresses that entered the region through the invasion by France in 1862. During this time the French emperor’s wife, Carlota of Belgium, threw elaborate balls and dinners with desserts like sorbet, puddings, and cakes baked by French chefs, as described by Mary Amberson in her book Maximilian and Carlota: Europe’s Last Empire in Mexico. Predictably, the French influence was also greatly felt in 19th century Mexican pastry, from orejas (a take on the French palmiers) to cuernitos (a take on croissants).

The first recorded doll cake draws inspiration from the poem “A Corpse Going to a Ball,” originally published by American author Seba Smith in 1843, about a girl named Charlotte who braves a frigid snowy night in an attempt to travel to a ball by sleigh, only to (spoiler) freeze to death. When mid-19th-century Germany started producing miniature porcelain dolls, they morbidly took to calling them “Frozen Charlotte” in reference to the popular poem. Poor Charlotte was carried around as a good-luck totem, and German bakers angling to profit on the trend began baking them into cakes––similar to the three kings bread, rosca de reyes, and Mardi Gras king cake, which both hide a baby doll figure somewhere within.

When Charles Dickens’s novel Barnaby Rudge was released in 1841, doll manufacturers began creating figures of the main character’s love interest, Dolly Varden, and the cake craze shortly followed. Dolly was a proper Victorian woman wearing a wide-brimmed hat and many layers of colorful skirts pinned up in a bustle, prompting fashion trends and even cake trends. While bakers didn’t recreate her exact likeness, the rise of “Dolly Varden Cakes” saw a surge in multicolored, multiflavored layer cakes that were often held together with jam. Around 1940, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother started a wedding cake topper trend in England of using bride and groom figurines that shared the likeness of the pair to be married. The cake style became an instant hit.

While the exact origins of the Barbie cake can’t be pinpointed, the first Barbie doll was released by Mattel in 1959. An immediate sensation, it likely boosted the already existing genre of doll cakes. By the 1970s, the cake decoration brand Wilton made crafting what became known as the Barbie cake, the fairytale cake, or the doll cake much easier. Wilton began selling a dome-shaped cake pan with a thin cylinder in the center called the Wonder Mold cake pan. This shape made inserting a doll pick––a pointy plastic pick that sticks out from the torso of the doll to stabilize it in the sweet bread––simpler. The cake pan also allowed bakers to achieve the dome shape of a skirt in one bake instead of having to cut and shape cake layers. Finally, in the 1980s, the first official recipe for a doll cake, known locally as a Dolly Varden cake, was featured in The Australian Women’s Weekly Children’s Birthday Cake Book. The painstakingly piped cake skirt, of course, likely takes inspiration from the ornate, voluminously ruffled and draped crinoline Victorian skirt styles built up by boning and a bustle in the 1850s.

How exactly is a Barbie cake created today? Do pairs of legs lurk beneath buttercream, or do bakeries have a designated bucket with glossy, tippy-toed doll limbs sticking out, toe side up? Jannette Pastrana, the Puerto Rican baker behind cottage bakery Jannette’s Cakes in Willimantic, Connecticut––currently only open to lucky friends and family of Pastrana in Bridgeport, CT, and now operating as Jannette La Piraguera, selling Puerto Rican shaved ice in the summertime––laughs at my bucket theory, and promptly corrects me. She’s been making doll cakes for quinceañera centerpieces since the height of their popularity in the ’80s and ’90s.

“Usually the dolls don’t have legs,” she says. Pastrana explains that the dolls used for cakes typically end at the waist, with a pick that’s used to stabilize them into the sponge of the cake, aptly dubbed a doll pick. Wilton still sells doll picks, as do a host of other companies, though folks can also scour eBay for vintage pieces. However, because of the lack of diversity available among Wilton doll picks in the late 20th century, Pastrana’s clients customarily provided their own Barbie doll, legs and all, to visually represent the girl whose birthday was being celebrated. This required some surgical adjustment, whether to the doll or to the shape of the cake. Inserting an entire Barbie could destabilize the cake, so Pastrana typically removed the legs first. She started rethinking her method after a young girl, who was reportedly horrified at the sight of a legless Barbie after cutting into her cake, returned to Pastrana requesting that her next doll cake please have legs.

While this cake form has been widely embraced by coming-of-age Latinas for their quinceañera celebrations and other birthdays, it’s clearly a nostalgic cake for many around the globe. Abena Anim-Somuah, the voice behind the Cherry Bombe podcast The Future Of Food Is You and the author of the Your Friend in Food newsletter, celebrated her first birthday in 1997 with a doll cake in Ghana. “My mom is just someone who is really into birthdays and celebration,” Anim-Somuah told me over text. “It was my first birthday cake I ever had, and I think it was a big deal for my mom having her first child, her first daughter.” Anim-Somuah’s mom had noticed her love of Barbies and commissioned her friend to bake her a white buttercream doll cake with pink trim.

In Singapore, food writer and vegan baker Gan Chin Lin says doll cakes were a “staple” locally in the late 2000s and early 2010s. “I feel like they were part of a larger, now antiquated character cake vogue,” Lin shared through DM. She says the “waist-down” cake design, which featured a skirt or sometimes even a mermaid tail and often portrayed Disney or Disney-adjacent princesses, was popular at her female friends’ birthday parties. It always surprised her, however, that the Barbie was naked underneath the sponge and buttercream.

These famous doll cakes have retained relevance through the decades, as evidenced by this Reddit thread from last year titled “Who remembers the grocery store barbie doll cakes???” They are still available for purchase through cottage, local, and chain bakeries like Publix (starting at $79.99 for a blonde Barbie with a pink frosting skirt). Online, whether through TikTok, YouTube, or Instagram, doll cakes continue to hold intrigue and excitement for bakers and viewers alike who showcase the creation process from beginning to end. From ultra-vintage-style Barbie cakes like Hannah Currie’s (@laretrorecipe) classic using a chic ’50s doll, to more modern doll cakes like those made by Mirvat Hachem-Osseili (@bakemydaymimo on TikTok) –– who focuses on Barbie dolls that reflect the beauty of little girls everywhere, like in this hijabi Barbie cake — the craft is alive and well.

As much as they still hold a special place in celebration and pastry, however, these cakes are simply not as popular as they once were. Even Wilton has taken notice. “Though doll cakes aren’t as popular as they used to be, we still see people have great heart for these kind of cakes, especially for birthday parties. Most often they are made into doll skirts decorated with buttercream or fondant,” the company’s representative, Kristen Agnello-Dean, wrote in an email.

This holds especially true for modern girls celebrating quinceañeras, who Pastrana says now ask for more sophisticated cake styles, like three-tier cakes with fondant. Irma Garcia, a custom cake baker located in Chula Vista, California, says she doesn’t get requests for doll-style cakes. Lately there’s been a spike in orders for tiered cakes, starting at three tiers and up, often reflecting the quince’s theme or just in an elegant and floral-decorated style.

Pastrana may have noticed the decline in Barbie cakes back in 2005, but she still has one devoted doll cake customer. “I’ve been baking her doll cakes every year for her birthday ever since her first,” she told me over the phone. That customer turns 21 this year, and she had planned a four-foot-tall cake with 20 miniature dolls from cakes past, some of which have been saved and some of which she would repurchase, all propped on one tall cake as the centerpiece. This pièce de résistance has been postponed, however, as the soon-to-be 21-year-old is going on a cruise for her upcoming birthday.

As for Pastrana, her love and nostalgia for the Barbie cake persists. Who knows? Maybe there is an order for a custom Barbie wedding cake in her future.

In the first blush of their relationship, The Washington Post and Jeff Bezos seemed like an excellent match. Here was a paper with a strong pedigree that had fallen on somewhat hard times, and a suitor with funds who seemed eager to return it to steady glory. In 2013 Bezos purchased the paper for $250 million from the Graham family and promised a “golden era” to come. I had left the Post by then but was happy for my former colleagues. When Donald Trump took office a few years later, it was a relief to know that a journalistic institution with a record of holding White House misdeeds to account was still close by.

Yesterday, in a dismal morning Zoom call, the Post’s executive editor, Matt Murray, announced that they were laying off one-third of its already diminished staff. The follow-up email had the tone of robotic obfuscation that any decent editor would have rewritten. (“Following up on today’s communication, I’m writing to share the difficult news that your position is eliminated as part of today’s organizational changes.”) It’s of course painful, as a journalist, to see fellow journalists get laid off. It’s painful, for anyone alert to the moment, to know that one of the last remaining expert watchdogs is hobbled. It’s maybe most painful to know it could have been avoided.

In this episode of Radio Atlantic, I spoke with Joshua Benton, the founder of and a senior writer at the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. Benton has closely watched the media business for years. He explains how the newspaper reached this point, the loss to journalism, and how the future of the Post is ultimately up to Bezos.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: Seven years ago, around this time, The Washington Post ran an ad in the Super Bowl: “Democracy dies in darkness.” It showed scenes of fires, explosions, floods, tanks—and journalists who’ve risked their lives for their profession.

All with swelling music and a voice-over by Tom Hanks.

Rosin: But then just before the Super Bowl this year, the Post took a different turn. And it was not another Super Bowl ad.

Rosin: On Wednesday, Post staffers joined a Zoom call first thing in the morning. Executive editor Matt Murray spoke first.

Rosin: The paper would be making massive cuts: closing the Sports department …

Rosin: Downsizing their Metro desk and International desk.

Rosin: One of their reporters based in Ukraine posted to X: “I was just laid off by The Washington Post in the middle of a warzone.”

Rosin: The entire Books department at the Post was cut.

Rosin: A suspension of their daily news show.

Rosin: Every single department would be impacted.

Rosin: In less than 30 minutes, a historic journalistic institution cut its staff by almost a third, after two previous rounds of punishing layoffs.

This was the home of the Watergate investigation.

Rosin: Publisher of the Pentagon Papers.

Rosin: Winner of dozens and dozens of Pulitzer Prizes.

Rosin: Just to break that down: a paper in the backyard of the White House and Congress that has, many times, uncovered people in power lying or grifting, or failing to do their jobs in ways that affect every single American, whether or not they live in D.C.

Not to mention all the work their reporters have done in Ukraine, and China, and the Middle East and anywhere else in the world where crisis might be brewing

I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic.

There are only a handful of mainstream national journalistic institutions left with this kind of robust infrastructure—experienced editors and reporters, photographers, foreign correspondents—who can expertly monitor people in power. Particularly at this moment in American history, when those people seem to be grifting and lying in new and elaborate ways.

Whose fault is this? Why does it matter? We talk to Joshua Benton. He’s a longtime newspaper reporter and the founder of a senior writer at the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University, where he writes about the media business.

Josh, welcome to the show.

Joshua Benton: Thanks for having me.

Rosin: So you cover the media business; you have for a long time. You are not new to this kind of industry news. What was your reaction to the layoffs at the Post?

Benton: Well, there have been a lot of systemic difficulties in the newspaper business as long as I’ve been reporting on it. There is a large secular decline that has been brought about by the internet that has continued on without too much change. But I think the story of the Post is a very unique-to-the-Post story. It’s fundamentally about one man, Jeff Bezos, and his changing vision of what the role of the owner of a major American newspaper should be.

Rosin: So you said two different things: It’s Post-specific and it’s also related to this giant in our culture, Jeff Bezos. I mean, I know why the news resonated with me—because I’m a journalist. I live in Washington. I worked at the Post. I have many friends there.

But I can imagine people who are not in any of those categories reading this news and thinking: Layoffs happen all the time, especially newspaper layoffs. This paper still exists, even though with less staff.

So why should they care? Why is it significant for people who don’t live in Washington, aren’t journalists?

Benton: Well, for one thing, The Washington Post has always been a paper whose editorial importance was not limited to the city or to the district. It’s a national outlet. It’s one of the two largest national newspaper outlets.

It covers the happenings in Washington, D.C. Certainly there’s lots of stories to cover there. So to the extent that we have any decrease in the number of people who are paying attention to what’s going on, I think that’s a loss.

It’s also a retrenchment from what Jeff Bezos first seemed to pledge when he first purchased the paper, in 2013, which was that he would not be looking to the newspaper as a source of money. He has enough money from lots of other sources. He did seem to take seriously the idea that he was a steward of an institution, the way that the Graham family that he purchased it from had always viewed the role of being in charge of this institution that mattered to the city and to the country.

And it’s certainly true that The Washington Post has lost money and is, has declined in a number of ways financially. It’s also up to Jeff Bezos whether or not he is going to support a newspaper that is going to be robust journalistically and ambitious digitally, or whether or not he has grown tired of it and decided to step back his investment in the property.

And I think what’s troubling in this particular change is, you’re seeing what had been an institution that had really benefited from his ownership for a good long time that seems to have gone into reverse in a way that particularly aligns with the way that the political winds in Washington have blown for the last few years.

Rosin: So it sounds like what you’re saying is the reason this is significant for everybody is because how Bezos changed his mind and changed his attitude towards the paper. So can you say a little more about that? What about his change of heart is important or strikes you as important?

Benton: We saw a confluence of events in the fall of 2024 around President Trump’s second election that I think were very telling. You had, in October, Bezos making a decision on behalf of the newspaper to stop endorsing candidates for president at a time that the newspaper would have certainly been expected to—and the editorial board of the newspaper had desired to—endorse Kamala Harris. Bezos put out a statement saying that actually it’s an awful idea for a newspaper to endorse a presidential candidate, because it creates the perception of bias. And we need to have a newspaper that doesn’t sully itself with a presidential endorsement.

Almost immediately that led to a huge negative impact to the paper’s bottom line because more than 250,000 existing subscribers canceled their subscriptions, and that’s the lifeblood of a modern-day media company. Not long after that, he announced that he was going to be shifting the way that the opinion pages of the paper functioned. He would potentially be eliminating most of the left-of-center perspectives in exchange for a focus on what he called “personal liberties and free markets.” He said explicitly, We will cover other issues besides personal liberties and free markets, but we will not be running any opinions that are in opposition to those.

He never really explained which personal liberties he was especially interested in, but it became pretty clear in the coming months that he was trying to shift the Post’s editorial page and opinion section more to the right, more aligned with the new Trump administration. And in the middle of that, you had the instance of Jeff Bezos appearing at Trump’s inauguration. You had the much-discussed, recently, purchase of the Melania Trump documentary at far-above market rates in a way that has been perceived by some to be something of a bribe.

You saw in this very short period of time a shift from the Post being an establishment—an institution—that was a potentially a powerful source of constraint on any presidential administration, but in particular this one, to the Post being perceived to be traveling along with the political winds.

Rosin: So it sounds like your analysis is very Bezos focused, because you could parse the blame for what happened on a few different places. It could be ownership—Jeff Bezos, management, just the state of the industry, the product itself. But you are focused on Bezos.

Benton: One thing that Jeff Bezos knows probably better than anyone else is that digital industries tend to focus around one big winner. I mean, Amazon.com is the perfect example of this. You went from a universe of having lots of diverse small retailers in the physical world, in malls and on main streets, to having one giant that dominates the online-retail business and doesn’t allow much else to thrive outside of it in a lot of cases. That same phenomenon happens in the digital news business. It’s just that, in digital news, The New York Times is Amazon.com. They are the giant that has been able to become overwhelmingly central to the way that the digital-newspaper business works. So in that context, the self-inflicted wounds that I would argue Bezos has caused the Post to suffer were particularly damaging because it was not competing from a position of strength. It was starting off from a position of relative market weakness.

Rosin: So initially we were talking about ideological factors, like a desire to curry favor with Trump, or at least not to irritate Trump. It sounds like now you’re talking about more, sort of, financial reasons. I mean, that suggests that, what, he’s a bad businessman?

Like, we don’t think of Jeff Bezos as a bad businessman. What does that suggest?

Benton: Jeff Bezos has not historically been very involved in the management of The Washington Post. He took a very hands-off approach to management. He was not, you know, meddling in editorial decisions. He was, in a lot of ways, for the first decade or so, a pretty ideal hands-off owner for the Post who put investment into the paper, who allowed its newsroom to grow, allowed, you know, a digital-subscription strategy to thrive.

But I don’t think at any point it has been a central part of where his business instincts have been focused. I wouldn’t view his ownership of The Washington Post as primarily a business transaction.

I think you could look at the first portion of his ownership as something approaching a philanthropic goal. And I think you can look at the last couple of years primarily as trying to meet a political goal.

One of the side effects of the changes that he made in 2024 or 2025 is that it drove away an enormous number of talented journalists, including to places like The Atlantic. One reason that the Post has struggled editorially over the past year is that they lost a lot of their best reporters, their highest-profile reporters who were the best source in the White House, in Congress, in places where, you know, the stories that a newspaper can break that gets you attention, that proves to your subscribers the value of the subscription they’re paying for.

The people who produce those stories often weren’t working there anymore. And the stories that they would have been writing, breaking, that would’ve been proving the value of a digital subscription to the Post—they just weren’t getting reported.

Rosin: So this is what—when people say a “death spiral” for news outlets where you have a shrinking business, leads to a downsized product, which leads to more shrinking business. Is that where the Post is now?

Benton: The biggest shift in the financial model of newspapers that has occurred in the transition from print to digital is a decreasing reliance on advertising and an increasing reliance on direct payments from subscribers. When newspapers had something closer to a monopoly on the distribution of information every day, they were able to charge very high advertising rates and they had mass audiences.

And it was a business that worked extremely well for them for a long time. Under the print model, an American newspaper usually made about 80 percent of its money from advertising and only about 20 percent from readers buying the paper or subscribing to the newspaper. In the shift to digital, the advertising money has largely gone away, to companies like Google and Facebook, and newspapers are increasingly reliant on subscriber revenue, especially, now, digital-subscriber revenue since that’s where the audiences are.

And to succeed in a digital-subscription world, you need to convince people why they should still pay for you every month when they’re also paying for Netflix and they’re also paying for Amazon Prime and they’re also paying for the long list of subscriptions that litter, you know, the credit-card bills of probably everyone listening to this.

That is a competitive marketplace where news organizations have a real editorial burden to prove their merits over and over again, and that means that a relatively small decision, like we’re not going to endorse someone for president can have a really outsized impact because it creates, for a quarter-million people, a reason to suddenly say, You know what? It’s not worth the 10 bucks a month, the 15 bucks a month that I’m paying if they’re gonna be doing something that I find so much in opposition to my point of view.

Rosin: After the break: Should people have really expected anything better from Bezos? And should all those people really have canceled their subscriptions? That’s in a minute.

[Break]

Rosin: In retrospect, now that I hear you talk and see how important that moment was when hundreds of thousands of people canceled their subscription, it was an act of protest, but now I feel like, were they protesting against the right thing and for the right place? It’s like shooting yourself in your, you know, civic-participation foot. It just doesn’t seem like they were aiming at the right target there.

Benton: Yeah, you saw at the time, when people were canceling their subscriptions, you would see on social media reporters from the Post saying: please don’t cancel the Post. We understand that you may, may not like the decision that was made by our owner, but it’s your money that allows us to keep operating, to allow us to still have jobs.

So there is a real tension there. But at the same time, for me, it’s very difficult to describe what happened at the Post as primarily a market-driven phenomenon.

The amount of money that the Post is losing is enormous to you or to me. To Jeff Bezos, it is nothing. His net worth in the past year has gone up enough to continue to pay for all the money that The Washington Post is losing for the rest of his life and the rest of his children’s lives and the rest of his grandchildren’s lives.

His wealth is at such a scale that there is no reason that a set of cuts like the one that we’ve seen this week is an economic necessity. It’s a choice.

There are enormous negative financial things happening in the digital-news business more broadly, but I think that is distinct from what is happening to The Washington Post, because that is one man’s choice fundamentally.

Rosin: And do you think that’s a reasonable expectation you’re making of Jeff Bezos? Like, he’s a businessman, and so: Why should we expect him to behave differently than the many negligent owners of many newspapers who I’m sure you’ve tracked over the last decade-plus?

Benton: You know, that’s a very reasonable question. I’d say the reason I would expect different is because he acted differently. The Washington Post was never a source of profit for him in any significant way.

When Bezos first bought the Post, in 2013, one way I’d thought about it was: There aren’t many things that a man that wealthy and that powerful can do to change something in the first few paragraphs of his obituary. When Jeff Bezos dies he will be described as the founder of Amazon.com, who, you know, created one of the great fortunes of all time.

You know, if he takes mankind to another planet, perhaps that would show up there as well. (Laughs.)

If he had saved one of the most important journalistic institutions in America, that would be another thing that would show up in those first few paragraphs, perhaps. There are reasons for someone with that much wealth to invest in something that they think is good for society, good for civilization, good for the country.

And the way he spoke when he purchased the Post was filled with language of, I’m giving you runway. I’m not a shareholder you have to pay in the same way that a publicly held or hedge-fund-purchased newspaper company would have to.

And it was the fact that that was his stance for so long, for a decade, that makes this transition, I think, somewhat jarring to people within the Post and people who read the Post.

Rosin: So it seems like the Post was struggling when Bezos bought it, and the layoffs seem to indicate it’s struggling now. But it did seem to be doing well at one point in his tenure. What made that possible, and what changed?

Benton: So our insight into the financial condition of the Bezos-era Post is really limited, because, as a privately held company, they don’t have to report any numbers to shareholders or regulators. It certainly was true, though, that they benefited starting around 2017 with the “Trump bump” that helped a lot of news organizations.

Once Trump was elected in this very unusual new federal government came into place, there was a huge increase in interest in national news that sort of raised all boats, and the Post certainly benefited from that because they were, along with the Times, one of the premier operations that was covering what was happening in Washington during this very unusual time.

So they had a huge increase in the number of subscribers that they had. They reached a peak, they reported, of around 3 million digital subscribers, which was the third-highest in the country behind the Times and also The Wall Street Journal. They were breaking stories left and right. When Bezos first appeared, he was willing to invest into increasing a lot of positions within the newsroom, adding a lot of people on the product side and on the digital side of the operation. It was a good time to be at the Post.

They also happened to have a very good editor at the time, Marty Baron, and they were blessed with the first Trump administration as a story to cover. There certainly is a universe in which you could have imagined a second Trump administration providing that same sort of bump or at least a smaller version of it to the Post.

But this is, one of the other unfortunate things about the timing is that at the exact moment that this second Trump administration was beginning was right when Jeff Bezos had shot themselves in the foot by not endorsing the presidential election and causing these 250,000 subscribers to cancel and making this pivot into having the Opinion section only be about “free markets” and the promotion of what he considers to be “personal liberties.”

I think there really was an opportunity for the Post to have another good stretch, editorially and financially. And I think you can point to some decisions that Bezos made as reasons why that didn’t happen.

Rosin: I mean, one question is, do you get the sense that the tech crowd thinks that journalism done by humans just doesn’t matter that much? Like, it’s the opposite of our future.

Benton: I’ve seen dozens and dozens of tech companies and start-ups and AI companies who tend to view news as a world of inefficiencies that are waiting to be quote-unquote “fixed.”

They look at a newsroom, which hires expensive people to do a lot of manual gathering of information and manual writing-up of that information or production of podcasts or videos about that information. They see a process that they think can be rendered more efficient and can have a lot of the cost structure ripped out of it.

I’m open to technological changes that could push in that direction. If they find wonderful ways to create that universe, you know, I’d love to hear about it. At the same time, I think, at a time that we as a society are increasingly concerned about the role of a few large technology companies and AI algorithms that we don’t have a lot of insight into, the amount of control that those institutions seem to have on very fundamental elements of the way information gets distributed, the way that the economy works—I think there’s a real disconnect in values there that I think would be pretty difficult for anyone to navigate.

Rosin: Let me just try this on you. Like, is there some alternate way that you can imagine holding government accountable? I guess I’m asking: Is journalism irrelevant? Like, is there any other way to create an informed citizenry?

Are we clinging to something that just, you know, isn’t gonna last?

Benton: Gosh, that’s dark. (Laughs.)

Rosin: I know it’s a terrible question. I’m just trying to elicit the best argument for why anyone should care about what you even are describing as this thing that has totally different values than this other thing. And I understand this other thing to have most of the money and you know, to have, for a long time, kind of shaped our culture.

Benton: But at the same time, if you look at a place like Minneapolis and you look at the power that video images of things happening in the streets, to someone like Renee Good: The impact that the right information can have on a political body; on a citizenry; on a populace; on a protest movement; eventually, on a government—that power, in my mind, hasn’t been diminished.

It used to be that it was much more the realm of individual reporters and individual newspapers and television networks to dig up this information and to share this information. Now there are many more potential inputs into that system, right?

But that doesn’t, to my mind, reduce the power that information—accurate, timely information about the world around us—can have in how society and government work. I think that we had a sort of unusual glory period for a number of decades across the 20th century where the things that were healthy for our democracy were also things that aligned really well with an advertising-driven business model.

It didn’t make a lot of sense at an intellectual level that the same people who would be reporting on what’s happening in Baghdad or what’s happening on some distant battlefield would be putting their work right next to furniture-store ads and classified ads for jobs and all the other things that created this unusual mixture of elements that was 20th-century mass media.

We were kind of lucky that those happened to align for a while. And they very much do not align anymore. I think the shift away from relying on advertising and relying on subscribers and people willing to invest, essentially, in what they see as being useful for democracy is a potential route to stability, in that—you know, The New York Times has been able to navigate that extremely well. They’re a much bigger business than they’ve ever been before and still doing lots of excellent journalism, though I’m sure everyone can critique any number of pieces of it.

I still think that there is an enormous amount of value in the work that journalists do, and there are models out there. And one of those models that a lot of people, for a while, had some hope in was philanthropically minded billionaires who would see the value in what journalism was doing, and also have the capacity to remove it from the marketplace of capitalism, at least to a degree.

And I think Jeff Bezos did that for a while, to a certain degree. So I think that’s why it’s extra-frustrating to see him instead shoving The Washington Post right back into that marketplace and saying, Oh no, now I have to make the same sort of decisions that someone who, you know, a struggling businessman who is worried about paying his mortgage might have to make—to make the difficult cuts.

That’s what makes it difficult—that this is very much a choice. This is a choice that one man made that is going to harm a lot of journalists and is going to harm a lot of people who would have benefited from the journalism.

Rosin: Okay, so: Is there a path forward for The Washington Post?

Benton: That’s entirely up to Jeff Bezos. He could decide to convert The Washington Post into a nonprofit. He could decide to keep shrinking and keep cutting. He could decide to invest again in anything that he’s decided not to invest in. It’s a property that he has total and complete control over. I think there is a path forward for good journalism.

The Post benefits from its incredible history and the relationships it has built up over the decades in Washington and beyond. But it’s also hamstrung by that history and by the fact that it is built out as a print business that has shifted towards digital as opposed to being a digital-first business, right. There are paths forward, and it’s really up to one man to decide if he chooses to take any of them.

Rosin: Well, Josh, thank you so much for joining me today.

Benton: Absolutely. My pleasure.

        <hr/>
        NEW YORK — “I don’t think that bitch looks fit,” a woman next to me murmurs. She’s carrying a Louis Vuitton bag, wearing Hermes riding boots, and speaking, of course, about one of the three female Cane Corsos still in the ring.

It’s not exactly an unwarranted thing for her to say; she does have a dog in this fight. Two, to be precise. The two fitter bitches both belong to her. With the way the judge has physically sorted the field, it’s clear that a male is about to be picked Best of Breed, and that means the likelihood of one of her dogs winning Best of Opposite (the award given to the best dog of the opposite sex) is pretty high.

Like many of the women around me, the Cane Corso owner is wearing a tweed suit. As I’ve learned from many handlers over the course of two days, those suits speak to the prestige, perfectionism, and traditionalism of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. It matters if the bitch is fit because that’s the name of the game. Sure, many of these dogs are born perfect; high-level breeders can often tell from puppyhood if a dog has potential to become show ready. They have to be champions just to get to Westminster. But in order to stand out here, at the “Super Bowl of Dog Shows,” the dogs need every edge they can get: a freshly cleaned coat that is maintained every few minutes, flawless posture, and, yes, a handler that has strategized their outfit around the canine they’ll be presenting.

At any given moment, hundreds of dogs are being prepped in the backstage benching area. The grooming never stops. Between barks and the occasional howl, there are suits being steamed, fur being straightened, black noses being buffed. This is the pinnacle of human obsession with the pursuit of aesthetics, channeled through man’s best friend. Dog shows are simultaneously about individuality and conformity. Breeds are trying to meet written aesthetic standards, but they are also trying to be singular. In many ways, the humans are no different. As one exhibitor tells me, “It’s the Dance Moms of dog shows.”

At Westminster, you’ll find hundreds of dog handlers who worship at the altar of St. John. “St. John” doesn’t refer to St. John’s men’s basketball, or noted local Episcopal cathedral St. John the Divine, or Saint John the Apostle himself. Instead, their devotion is to the American luxury knitwear brand St. John, founded in 1962 and known for its Chanel-like knit suits and skirts. The 19-year-old handler with the longhaired dachshund is wearing a cream-colored St. John suit. That Pomeranian owner’s sparkly red two-piece? St. John. The rhinestone-encrusted skirt? St. John. I stop to ask two women in the benches where their monochrome suits are from. They say in unison, “St. John.”

“I had an unfortunate experience [with a St. John suit] at Westminster a few years ago,” says Charlotte Wagner, who is showing her American Staffordshire Terrier. Wagner is the first woman I’ve spoken to who is wearing something other than St. John. “It was my first year attending as an exhibitor, not a spectator. And I ordered a beautifully made St. John dress. … It arrived the day before Westminster, and it was way too big. So I never understood the trend, because it’s not for my shape.”

This is Wagner's first year at Westminster as a U.S. citizen, although she’s lived here for 38 years. Her outfit—from Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, and other American designers—is a tribute to the dog, who is American and named “Ralph” for Ralph Lauren (although his registered name is “Carmichael Dressed to Impress”). Below us, Ralph pants. Most of the time, he’s an Appalachian farm dog, but this week he’s a star.

“You’ll need to clean your lens,” Wagner warns me. “Ralph just licked your camera.”

As for the men, the options for creativity are limited only by your imagination—as long as it’s within the confines of a suit. Andrew Webber, who got his first show dog two years ago, has a light brown German Pinscher named Gravy. “As much as your dog looks nice, you want to look nice as well,” Webber tells me. To pair with Gravy, he wears a lot of blue and greens, and mixes patterns to add a little fun.

I ask another handler, Ashley Wilkerson, where her suit is from. “I’m wearing a St. John suit, lots of glitter, lots of sparkle. My dog is black, so I want him to stand out as much as I do, and have a contrast,” Wilkerson says. As for the St. John suits, she tells me that they’re comfortable, professional-looking, and a status symbol.

There’s a St. John booth in the vendors section at Westminster. A glance at the tags will give you sticker shock—even on sale, these suits are well over a thousand dollars. It’s the first time St. John has had a booth at Westminster, the attendants tell me, a response to the immense popularity of the brand among dog handlers. They’ve been getting a lot of purchasers whose dogs won Best in Breed. Since their dogs have advanced to the next round of competition at Madison Square Garden, they’re looking to debut a new suit.

But for the most part, the suits at Westminster are secondhand. Multiple women tell me that they bought their suits off their friends, or somebody they met at a dog show. Many are wearing suits from the 1970s. The Facebook group “St John Dog Show Outfits” has over 13,000 members, and the secondhand suit sets are typically priced at a few hundred dollars.

“This originally was probably a suit I couldn’t afford, and I bought this suit for $90,” Teena Uyeno, dog owner and handler, tells me. She’s sitting with her friend, Ava Hata, who’s also an owner and handler. Asked why the St. John suits are so great, Uyeno tells me that they’re fairly stretchy, and mobility is extremely important when you’re running and moving with a dog.

I soon learn how important it is to dress for movement and comfort. In the Samoyed ring, a handler wipes out when their dog starts running too fast. The heels she’s wearing were a last-minute decision, and she couldn’t move well enough with them.

Two hours after I take a poodle’s picture in the benching area, I circle back to find the same woman still fussing with its fur. Thus is the life of a longhaired show dog—endless primping, and a little less petting. Uyeno tells me some show dog owners will pay something like $5,000 a month just for hair maintenance on their dogs. “It’s crazy,” she says.

Out in the rings, I see two convention-goers petting a fluffy Alaskan Malamute. The handler tenses. “Please don’t touch, because once you start petting him, he likes to go on his back, and I just worked up all that volume.”

There are steel dog combs everywhere, occasionally tucked in the updos of handlers, other times held between human teeth when hands are occupied with leashes. Every few seconds, someone is stopping to brush out their dog again. Sometimes, they’ll mist them with antistatic spray.

The shorthaired dogs can’t get away with relaxing either. Handlers rush around to take their dogs for practice laps—they’ll be evaluated on how “nicely” they move, so they need to be limbered up. Outside the ring where boxers are being judged, I hear some remark on the musculature of one of the dogs. As we’ve established, it’s important to be fit.

Back in the benches, I see a spaniel being blown dry with a Dyson Supersonic. Around the corner, a precious West Highland White Terrier is being bathed in a tub of white powder to enhance its brightness. A woman is spritzing her Maltese with (human) salon-grade leave-in product. I’m starting to think these dogs have better hair than I could ever hope for. There’s bottles and bottles of Tresemmé extra hold hair spray wherever I look. What is that man doing to that big old Tibetan Mastiff? “Red light therapy,” the man tells me.

The ultimate bookstore bucket list for bibliophiles.

Book lovers travel for authors, for ideas, for history, but also for rooms. A great bookstore can be a kind of gentle escapism made architectural. Around the world, a handful of them have earned reputations not as retail stops but as cherished landmarks. Churches stripped of pews, former theaters, banks, warehouses, and improbably modern structures. They are places where people linger without buying, buy without needing, and leave feeling altered in some way. Here are 10 beautiful locations to add to your little black book of bookstores.

1 OF 10

El Ateneo Grand Splendid

WHERE: Buenos Aires, Argentina

With more bookstores per capita than almost anywhere in the world, Buenos Aires is a literary powerhouse with picturesque book nooks like Eterna Cadencia and Librería de Ávila, the oldest in the Argentine capital. However, nowhere is more reverence shown for the written word with greater drama than at El Ateneo Grand Splendid, the city’s most famous literary landmark. It occupies a former theater on Avenida Santa Fe that first opened in 1919. The frescoed ceiling still arches overhead, and original balconies curve around the space, though they now carry shelves instead of spectators. A deep red curtain continues to frame the former stage, where a café now stands. Be sure to head to the upper balconies for the best view of the space where daring performances once unfolded.

2 OF 10

Livraria Lello

WHERE: Porto, Portugal

There are few bookstores in the world that require advance planning, timed entry, and a tolerance for crowds before you’ve even seen a single spine. Opened in 1906 in Porto, Livraria Lello is one of Portugal’s oldest bookstores, and it is regularly cited as one of the most beautiful in the world. Housed in a neo-Gothic, Art Nouveau building, it is a dazzler of an edifice with carved wood, intricate plasterwork, and a luminous stained-glass ceiling that glows overhead like a secular chapel. The bookstore’s modern fame is largely due to persistent rumors that it inspired Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling. Visiting Livraria Lello is rewarding for the aesthetics, but a place for leisurely browsing, this is not. Expect crowds and queues, and be sure to get your ticket well in advance. The price goes towards any books bought in-store.

3 OF 10

Cărturești Carusel

WHERE: Bucharest, Romania

Opened in 2015 in Bucharest’s Lipscani district, Cărturești Carusel occupies a building with a past as layered as its shelves. Built in 1903 for the influential Chrissoveloni banking family, it was later nationalized under the Communist regime and eventually abandoned as communism collapsed. After three decades of legal battles, the original owner’s grandson finally reclaimed the decaying structure in 2007. What followed was an ambitious restoration involving more than 20,000 hours of labor, transforming it into what is now known as the “Carousel of Light.” Designed to be both a bookstore and a gathering place, it is popular, photogenic, and often busy with book lovers milling about the four luminous white floors curved around a central atrium.

4 OF 10

Libreria Acqua Alta

WHERE: Venice, Italy

When Venetian bookseller Luigi Frizzo leased his current space in 2002, he was warned that the property lay in a flood-prone zone near Piazza San Marco. Rather than retreat, he leaned in, naming the shop after the seasonal high tide that regularly seeps into Venice’s lowest quarters. Libreria Acqua Alta offers an eclectic mix of Venetian history, art books, novels, comics, and rare secondhand editions. To protect hundreds of thousands of volumes, including rare and out-of-print works, Frizzo devised an improvised flood-defense system: books stored in bathtubs, waterproof bins, and even full-sized gondolas. The now-famous staircase built from books began as a pragmatic solution for storage. Today, it doubles as one of Venice’s most photographed vantage points.

5 OF 10

Boekhandel Dominicanen

WHERE: Maastricht, Netherlands

Formerly known as Selexyz Dominicanen, Boekhandel Dominicanen occupies a 13th-century Gothic church whose religious function ended more than two centuries ago. Since then, the building has lived several lives, serving variously as a bicycle shed, a storage space, and even a carnival venue, before reopening in 2006 as a bookstore. The transformation was led by Dutch architects Merkx + Girod, who preserved the integrity of the church’s soaring vaults and frescoed ceilings by inserting a two-story black steel bookcase along one side of the nave. Books now rise where hymns once did, and there’s a wide selection of Dutch and English-language new and second-hand titles. The store is centrally located in Maastricht’s Binnenstad and open daily.

6 OF 10

Shakespeare and Company

WHERE: Paris, France

Directly opposite Notre-Dame at 37 rue de la Bûcherie, stands Shakespeare and Company, a bookstore in a 17th-century former monastery. American expat George Whitman opened it in 1951 as a place for Anglophone literary life in Paris to take root. Over the decades, it did exactly that, welcoming writers from Allen Ginsberg to James Baldwin and Julio Cortázar. Originally called Le Mistral, the shop was renamed Shakespeare and Company in 1964 to deliberately invoke the memory of the original Shakespeare and Company that was founded in 1919 by Sylvia Beach on rue de l’Odéon. The store hosts literary events and festivals, and uniquely, runs a Tumbleweeding program whereby writers can apply to live, write, and read on the premises for up to a month while assisting with events.

7 OF 10

Atlantis Books

WHERE: Santorini, Greece

For nearly two decades, Atlantis Books occupied a cave-like space in Oia, carved into the cliffside. It might have moved from its original perch, but it’s still a sight for sore eyes in Santorini’s northern village of Firostefani. Founded in 2004 by American philosophy student Craig Walzer and a small circle of friends, the bookstore began almost accidentally, sparked by a ferry ride from Piraeus, too much wine, and the realization that Santorini offered little in the literary department. Walk its white walls to uncover new and pre-loved books in English, Greek, Spanish, Italian, and more.

8 OF 10

Daikanyama T-Site

WHERE: Tokyo, Japan

Designed by Klein Dytham Architecture, the Daikanyama T-Site complex in Tokyo consists of three low-rise buildings arranged around a quiet garden. Its most striking feature is the latticed white façade, formed from hundreds of interlocking “T” shapes that subtly reference the logo of the Tsutaya books and media enterprise. Inside, the selection is vast, with books in multiple languages, niche titles, and an exceptional range of magazines, including rare international periodicals from the 1960s and 1970s. Music and film sit comfortably alongside literature, with CDs, vinyl, and even DVDs (remember those). With lounges, cafes, and even a convenience store, you are at liberty to enjoy the daily 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. opening hours without feeling hurried.

9 OF 10

Ler Devagar

WHERE: Lisbon, Portugal

Lisbon’s LX Factory, a former industrial zone wedged between the city center and Belém, has been reimagined as a cultural enclave of studios, cafés, and independent shops. Ler Devagar occupies a vast former printing warehouse there, with the machinery of mass production left intact. The bookstore was founded in 1999 in the Bairro Alto neighborhood and relocated to LX Factory in 2009. It functions simultaneously as a bookstore, café, exhibition space, and cultural venue, hosting debates, talks, and installations alongside its carefully curated collection. Ler Devagar means “read slowly,” and bookish folks have upwards of 40,000 titles to peruse. Books climb the walls across four levels, rising toward a ceiling some fourteen meters high. At the center of it all hangs the bookstore’s most iconic feature, an art installation of a white bicycle suspended improbably in midair.

10 OF 10

Foyles Charing Cross Road

WHERE: London, England

Foyles Charing Cross Road stands in the former home of prestigious London art and design college Central Saint Martins. This purpose-designed flagship was created in collaboration with architects Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands, and its specialist departments, housing more than 200,000 titles, are organized around a central, skylit atrium. You can take the stairs or use the lifts to traverse this concrete neighborhood of books loved by all ages. Children gather for weekly story times on Sundays, aspiring adventurers find travel books on level four, famished readers linger over coffee and pastries at the fifth-floor cafe, and authors regularly take the stage at the auditorium on the sixth floor. Foyles Charing Cross Road is a welcoming world of a place, grand without being intimidating.

        <hr/>
        Tim Baucom has done this before. The Milan Cortina Games will be his third Olympics as a wax technician for the United States’ cross-country ski team, a job characterized by long flights schlepping tools and duffel bags of gear halfway around the world, and even longer days prepping skis. His objective is to help American athletes gain even a fraction of a second in competition. But for the first time at an Olympics, he won’t have what was once one of the most powerful tools in his kit: fluorinated ski waxes.

In sports where a gold medal can be decided by inches, downhill and cross-country skiers and snowboarders across the competitive spectrum have used so-called “fluoros” since the 1980s. Typically sold as powders or blocks of hard wax, these lubricants are renowned for their ability to wick water and shed grime, making it easier to glide through snow with minimal resistance, especially in warm conditions. “There’s nothing in the chemical world that I’m aware of that can replicate their hydrophobic and dirt-repelling properties,” Baucom said.

But the reason these products work so well is that they contain PFAS, short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. This class of 15,000 so-called “forever chemicals” is notorious for their harmful effects on human health and the natural world. After years of mounting concern over human exposure and environmental contamination, the International Ski and Snowboard Federation, known by its French acronym FIS, banned the use of fluoros in 2023. “I think it kind of is our duty as a winter sport to have some concern for the environment,” said Katherine Stewart-Jones, a cross-country skier who will represent Canada at the Games, which begin tomorrow.

While athletes have had two World Cup seasons to get used to the change, this marks the first Winter Games without the advantage conferred by these once-ubiquitous products. It will be the highest-stakes test yet for racers and wax technicians’ ability to work with products that are less effective and more sensitive to what’s happening on the trails and slopes.

“There are a lot more unknowns with the new waxes,” said Julia Kern, a U.S. cross-country skier who has won two World Championship medals and hopes to add Olympic hardware to her collection. “I definitely think it makes it more challenging.”

People have been lubricating skis for centuries. The History of Lapland, published in 1704, describes Sámi skiers using pine pitch or rosin to create a smooth, waterproof surface for their wooden skis. By the 1800s, athletes were experimenting with glycerin, whale oil, kerosene, and spermaceti, and the early 1900s brought water-repellent shellacs. In the 1940s, the Norwegian company Swix — a portmanteau of “ski” and “wax” — helped popularize petroleum-derived paraffin waxes.

PFAS proliferated after the 1938 invention of Teflon — the stuff used in nonstick pots and pans — and were added to everything from takeout containers and outdoor clothing to firefighting foam and upholstery. But it wasn’t until the 1980s that PFAS made their way to skiing and snowboarding. These chemicals promised greater speed with less fuss in changing conditions. California entrepreneur Terry Hertel was among the first to dabble with the stuff after buying a fluorocarbon sample from the chemical company 3M. After realizing they made skis “faster than anything before,” he began adding fluorocarbons to his company’s waxes. Companies like Toko and Swix quickly followed.

Nathan Schultz, a former U.S. cross-country racer who now owns a ski shop in Denver, remembers trying fluoro formulas for the first time in the mid-‘90s. “You put that stuff on your skis and it was like you were floating,” he said. Quantifying the exact advantage they conferred was difficult, since cross-country, downhill, and snowboard courses vary widely and race-day conditions differ from season to season. Still, he said, the effects were tangible, especially on wet snow. At first, fluoros were predominantly used by racers at important events because of their high cost. But by the time Schultz retired in 2006, everyone was using them.

“If you tried to do a race without fluorinated wax, you would not be competitive,” Schultz said. “The amount of speed you could buy on your skis was really ridiculous.”

There was only one problem: The world could no longer ignore the dangers of PFAS. The chemicals were turning up everywhere, contaminating soil, food, and drinking water. Studies increasingly linked exposure to thyroid disease, developmental problems, and cancer.

Baucom experienced that growing awareness himself, first as a collegiate racer and, starting in the late aughts, as a professional cross-country ski tech. Talk of the health risks was swirling through his sport’s often cramped and poorly ventilated wax rooms, where techs heated fluoro wax and ironed it into ski bases, kicking vapors and particulates into the air along the way. Wearing a mask or cracking a window provided only so much protection. “Any time you’re breathing in fumes and smoke, no matter what it is, it’s probably not great for you,” said Baucom, who was concerned about the growing body of research on the chemicals’ health risks. “It was pretty obvious right out the gate that these products have potential carcinogenic components.”

Evidence of the risk mounted throughout the 2010s. One particularly alarming study from 2010 found that PFAS accumulated in the bodies of Scandinavian wax technicians, whose blood levels of the compound PFOA averaged 25 times higher than those of the general population. A 2024 study later confirmed the concentrations in people like Baucom “are among the highest of any occupation investigated to date.”

“There was high exposure intensity, frequency, and duration,” said Kate Crawford, an author of the more recent research and an assistant professor of environmental studies at Middlebury College.

John Steel Hagenbuch, a Nordic, or cross-country, skier on the U.S. Ski Team, recently had his blood tested and discovered his PFAS levels are higher than average. “The main concern with [PFAS] is that they’re so persistent,” he said. “They can remain in your blood or in water for a really long time.”

PFAS’s durability means these chemicals don’t break down as they move from skis to snow and then into the soil and nearby watersheds. The full extent of contamination remains difficult to quantify, but growing evidence suggests it extends well beyond wax rooms.

In 2021, officials in Park City, Utah, detected the compounds in three wells drawing from an underground aquifer, including one near the start line of White Pine Touring Nordic Center race course. At first, water quality specialist Michelle De Haan suspected firefighting foam, but local agencies hadn’t used it. She later came across a study examining fluorinated race lubricants and, of the 14 related compounds identified in the study, 11 matched those found in the city’s aquifer. “That became a clearer picture to us,” De Haan said. While not definitive on its own, the finding suggested a likely link — one echoed by sampling in Europe that has found elevated PFAS levels on ski slopes there too.

The impact can be especially significant when ski racers bring PFAS to places that might not otherwise be contaminated. “In some instances, people would be [using fluorinated waxes] in relatively pristine areas,” said Crawford. “It becomes a relatively significant environmental problem.”

For years, these issues with ski wax lurked in plain sight. But as scientists learned more, the ski and snowboard community found itself caught between the knowledge that fluoros carried serious risks and the desire for easy speed.

By the late 2010s, the unease surrounding PFAS had begun to shape policy that impacted, or even targeted, ski waxes. Regulators in the U.S. and Europe restricted some of the most-studied PFAS, in part by requiring manufacturers to get formal approval before using them in new applications. A handful of smaller races implemented their own fluoro bans — “wax truces,” as Schultz described them — though it remained difficult to compete without them in events that didn’t participate.

Momentum grew in 2019, when the International Ski and Snowboard Federation, or FIS, announced plans for a blanket ban covering all 7,000 Nordic, Alpine, and snowboard competitions under its purview, including the World Cup. The decision elicited “surprise/shock,” said Lars Karlöf, the sanctioning body’s technical adviser, but it was intended to “limit the environmental impact of our activities as much as possible.”

That’s when Swix disposed of its stockpile of fluoro waxes, says Geoff Hurwitch, commercial director for Swix USA. While he’s not sure exactly how much the company got rid of, or how it did so, he knows it was “a lot.” But, he said, it was no longer in compliance with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards and the company knew it wasn’t going to be able to sell it anyway. Jeremy Hecker, chief of operations at the ski division of another wax company, Rex Wax, said the move away from fluoros resulted in up to $30,000 in “dead inventory” — containers of fluoros that have either been destroyed or are collecting dust in storage.

The FIS ban, while announced in 2019, did not take effect until the winter of 2023. Other sanctioning bodies, resorts and even towns across North America and Europe followed suit. Park City, for example, went fluoro-free in 2023 and allowed skiers and snowboarders to swap their stash for eco-friendlier options. TIn the fluoro ban’s first year, the city collected more than 600 pounds of the polluting wax during the ban’s first year.

Overall, the transition has worked “relatively smoothly,” said Knut Nystad, a wax technician for the Norwegian Ski Association. Kern, the U.S. cross-country skier, attributes that in part to the culture of the sport. “People in the cross-country community are very environmentally conscious,” she said. “They want to have clean water, they value their health a lot.”

That broad buy-in, however, doesn’t mean the change has been seamless.

One complication involves testing and enforcement. Because fluorinated compounds do not break down easily, traces can linger even on skis and snowboards that have been thoroughly cleaned, leading to false positives. But the steepest learning curve has been for the teams as technicians and athletes adjusted to a new generation of waxes.

“It took a while for technicians to learn the new chemistry,” said Julia Mehre Ystgaard, who works withcoordinates Canada’s Nordic World Cup team. Schultz said early fluoro-free waxes were “very inferior” to fluorinated options. “It was kind of crazy,” he said. A ski might feel “pretty good” in one sunny stretch of a course and “terrible” in a shadier section.

The modern alternatives still tend to be slower, and as U.S. cross-country skier Hagenbuch put it, they don’t do as well in late-season snow that’s warm and wet “like mashed potatoes.” He said it has become more common for his team to “miss the wax,” meaning skis aren’t well matched to the day’s conditions. Kern agreed, adding that the effect is especially noticeable on downhills. “You’re right behind [someone] at the top of a hill, and then they just pull away even though you’re in the draft where you should be pulling up on them,” she said.

That impact can be compoundingly decisive: Less glide at the bottom of a hill makes it harder to crest the next one, and less lubrication demands more effort to maintain speed. Suddenly an athlete is off the podium. Alpine and snowboard races are generally much shorter than Nordic events — minutes versus potentially hours — but the high speeds and friction also make wax choice critical.

“Fluoros were easier because fluoros were fast,” Hagenbuch said. “[They] have been referred to as, like, a ‘great equalizer.’”

Hurwitch, at Swix, says the new class of waxes are three to five years away from being as fast as the fluoros, and that company chemists are putting in thousands of kilometers of testing to reach that goal. Until then, however, the great equalizer is gone and other determinants of speed have taken on outsize importance. That, of course, includes physical conditioning and technique. You have to “make sure you have the steak first before you add the salt or the pepper,” said Nystad. But choosing the right equipment has become more important too.

The art of grinding skis has become especially critical. The process involves passing a ski or snowboard over stone, to inlay a pattern designed for a specific snow condition, or set of conditions, like a tire tread. Zach Caldwell, a former Nordic racer and owner of a Vermont ski shop, said this is one reason he’s seen a “dramatic” increase in the number of cross-country skis teenage racers buy: so they can have pairs optimized for different circumstances. Baucom, the wax tech, said these pre-wax decisions once accounted for 80 to 90 percent of a Nordic setup’s speed, but without fluoros they now account for as much as 97 percent.

The shift has raised concerns about competitive balance. While fluoros weren’t cheap, they were less expensive than perfecting grinds on an ever-larger armada of skis. Grinding machines alone can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and require tremendous expertise to run. Some athletes worry that this gives an advantage to countries like Norway — home to many major ski and wax companies — with deeper research budgets and larger wax tech teams.

Hagenbuch said fluoros “brought the delta between how good people’s skis were together.” Without them, the gaps are remerging. He pointed to a December skiathlon in Trondheim, Norway, where his teammate Gus Schumacher was in contention for a medal yet finished 21st. Something similar happened at a 50-kilometer race last March, where only one athlete on Schumacher’s brand of skis finished in the top 20.

“It wasn’t the wax. It wasn’t the athlete. … That was the skis,” said Hecker, with Rex Wax. And anyone with the wrong skis in Milano-Cortina will almost certainly miss their shot at the podium — something no amount of non-fluorinated wax will fix.

Even as fluorinated waxes disappear from competition, some athletes and technicians caution against assuming all problems have been solved. Nystad was among several people who noted that there’s no guarantee replacement products are benign. “A lot of people think that a fluoro ban means that now all waxes are healthy and you can almost use it as a jam on your sandwich and eat it,” he said. “But that’s not the case … You could have other chemicals in there that are not equally harmful, but that are harmful to nature and to individuals.”

Because formulas are proprietary, it can be difficult to know exactly what newer waxes contain. They likely include petroleum-derived ingredients that can transfer to snowpacks. Even so, some industry insiders question how much attention wax deserves compared with snow sports’ other environmental implications. “It doesn’t make sense to me to discuss the environmental impacts of this until we have really cleared house on the environmental impact of travel, and the food we eat, and the clothes that we wear,” Caldwell said.

Ski and snowboarding wax is also a minor contributor to the PFAS problem, globally. Crawford called it a “comparative drop in the bucket,” pointing to the fact that almost all commercial carpeting in the world is laden with PFAS. But the relative success of the ban in ski waxes is unique and could offer lessons — and hope — to anyone trying to get the chemicals out of other products.

“There are always options,” said Hurwitch, noting that none of Swix’s new products — from outerwear to waxes — contain PFAS. “The water repellency in jackets may not be as good as it was with a PFAS based product but it’s still a great product. The wax may not be quite as reliably fast, yet, but for the vast majority of us skiers, it’s still plenty fast. It will come though.”

The Olympic cross-country schedule begins Saturday with the women’s skiathlon. Kern will be racing at her second Games in temperatures that are expected to hover around freezing, where wax could be crucial. “We’re pretty much always testing skis,” she said. “We have to rely on and trust our wax team.”

Hagenbuch will make his Olympic debut in Milan Cortina. The ban creates additional stress, he admits, but he believes it’s worth it. “For Tim and the other service technicians and for me and for our groundwater and for the environment, yeah, I think it’s good that we don’t do fluoros,” he said. “Do I miss them? Yeah, a little bit.”

        Claim:

Musician Kid Rock sang "I like 'em underage" and "some say that's statutory" in the song "Cool, Daddy Cool."

In early February 2026, online users shared a rumor claiming that, decades earlier, musician Kid Rock released a song with lyrics that included "I like 'em underage" and "some say that's statutory but I say it's mandatory." Users claimed the lyrics appeared in the song "Cool, Daddy Cool," which was used in the 2001 part-animation, part-live-action film "Osmosis Jones." Snopes received reader mail highlighting the matter.

The claim circulated in the days after Turning Point USA announced (archived) Kid Rock would perform in the conservative organization's "All-American Halftime Show," an event competing with the Super Bowl's official halftime performance, which was set to be headlined by Spanish-language rapper Bad Bunny.

For example, on Feb. 3, a Threads user posted (archived) the lyrics with references to both halftime shows. The post read:

If you translate Bad Bunny's lyrics to English, he really isn't an appropriate pick to headline the Super Bowl Halftime Show.

"Young ladies, young ladies, I like 'em underage. See, some say that's statutory, but I say it's mandatory."

Oh wait..my bad. That's actually Kid Rock, headliner of the MAGA 'Christian' halftime show. So that tracks.

Users also shared the claim on Facebook (archived), Instagram (archived), Threads (archived) and X (archived).

In short, Kid Rock, whose real name is Robert James Ritchie, truly released a song with those lyrics, though another performer sang part of the lyrics.

The song, "Cool, Daddy Cool," appeared on the "Osmosis Jones" soundtrack and is available on Spotify and YouTube. The track list on the soundtrack's CD case credits the song to "Kid Rock featuring Joe C." — a rapper whose real name was Joseph Calleja and who died in November 2000.

The movie itself, which was free for U.S. viewers via the Tubi streaming service, featured only part of the song and did not include the "underage" and "statutory" lines. The relevant scene begins around the 51:30 mark in the movie.

The movie's credits (at 1:34:26) say the song was written by Kid Rock (listed as Ritchie), Bob Crewe and Frank Slay Jr.

Snopes contacted the Creative Artists Agency to ask if a representative for Kid Rock wished to comment on the lyrics. We also emailed Turning Point USA to ask if the organization had a response to users sharing the claim and will update this article if we receive further information.

'Cool, Daddy Cool' lyrics

Song-lyric website Genius published a transcription of "Cool, Daddy Cool," noting which parts Kid Rock and Joe C. sang.

The third verse features the "underage" and "statutory" lines (emphasis ours):

Now, some people say my mind's blown, I'm coolin' like a snow cone

On my cell phone I'm paid, G, can't call me, just page me

Young ladies, young ladies, I like 'em underage, see

Some say that's statutory (But I say it's mandatory)

My story ain't that complex, two forties and a Rolex

I rip, I rock, I roll, G, I trim my hair with the Flowbee

Got soul, G, like Al Green, co-coolin' like the A-Team

From Maine to San Francisco, I'm shootin' like a pistol

I'm so slick, I'm Crisco, daddy likes to disco

The website noted with italics that Joe C. sang the "but I say it's mandatory" response to the "statutory" lyric sung by Kid Rock.

Kid Rock's character, 'Osmosis Jones' plot

IMDb.com published the plot for "Osmosis Jones" — directed by brothers Bobby and Peter Farrelly — as follows: "A policeman white blood cell, with the help of a cold pill, must stop a deadly virus from destroying Frank, the person they live in."

For the movie and soundtrack, Kid Rock provided the singing voice for an animated lime-green germ performing with a band of germs named Kidney Rock. The band sang "Cool, Daddy Cool" in a club named "The Zit." Kid Rock's character, who the film's creators left unnamed in the credits, featured attire somewhat similar to that worn by Kid Rock, including a fedora.

The satirical publication The Onion highlighted (archived) the song in April 2025 with the headline, "Trump Pardons Kid Rock For Whatever Inspired Statutory Rape Lyric In 'Cool, Daddy Cool.'"

        <hr/>
        For academics, historians and activists, the past year has been tumultuous in advocating the teaching of Black history in the United States.

Despite last year proclaiming February as National Black History Month, President Donald Trump started his second term by claiming some African American history lessons are meant to indoctrinate people into hating the country. The administration has dismantled Black history at national parks, most recently removing an exhibit on slavery in Philadelphia last month. Black history advocates see these acts and their chilling effect as scary and unprecedented.

“States and cities are nervous about retribution from the White House,” said DeRay Mckesson, a longtime activist and executive director of Campaign Zero, an organization focused on police reform. “So even the good people are just quieter now.”

In the 100th year since the nation’s earliest observances of Black History Month — which began when scholar Carter G. Woodson pioneered the first Negro History Week — celebrations will go on. The current political climate has energized civil rights organizations, artists and academics to engage young people on a full telling of America’s story. There are hundreds of lectures, teach-ins and even new books — from nonfiction to a graphic novel — to mark the milestone.

“This is why we are working with more than 150 teachers around the country on a Black History Month curriculum to just ensure that young people continue to learn about Black history in a way that is intentional and thoughtful,” Mckesson said about a campaign his organization has launched with the Afro Charities organization and leading Black scholars to expand access to educational materials.

New graphic novel highlights history of Juneteenth

About three years ago, Angélique Roché, a journalist and adjunct professor at Xavier University of Louisiana, accepted a “once-in-a-lifetime” invitation to be the writer for a graphic novel retelling of the story of Opal Lee, “grandmother of Juneteenth.”

Lee, who will also turn 100 this year, is largely credited for getting federal recognition of the June 19 holiday commemorating the day when enslaved people in Texas learned they were emancipated. Under Trump, however, Juneteenth is no longer a free-admission day at national parks.

Juneteenth helped usher in the first generation of Black Americans who, like Woodson, was born free. “First Freedom: The Story of Opal Lee and Juneteenth,” the graphic novel, comes out Feb. 10. It is the culmination of Roché’s assiduous archival research, phone chats and visits to Texas to see Lee and her granddaughter, Dione Sims.

“There is nothing ‘indoctrinating’ about facts that are based on primary sources that are highly researched,” said Roché, who hopes the book makes it into libraries and classrooms. “At the end of the day, what the story should actually tell people is that we’re far more alike than we are different.”

While Lee is the main character, Roché used the novel as a chance to put attention on lesser known historical figures like William “Gooseneck Bill” McDonald, Texas’ first Black millionaire, and Opal Lee’s mother, Mattie Broadous Flake.

She hopes this format will inspire young people to follow Lee and her mantra — “make yourself a committee of one.”

“It doesn’t mean don’t work with other people,” Roché said. “Don’t wait for other people to make the changes you wanna see.”

Campaign aims to train new generation of Black historians

When Trump’s anti-DEI executive orders were issued last year, Jarvis Givens, a professor of African and African American Studies at Harvard, was thousands of miles away teaching in London, where Black History Month is celebrated in October. He had already been contemplating writing a book for the centennial.

Watching Trump’s “attack” cemented the idea, Givens said.

“I wanted to kind of devote my time while on leave to writing a book that would honor the legacy that gave us Black History Month,” Givens said.

The result is “I’ll Make Me a World: The 100-Year Journey of Black History Month,” a book with four in-depth essays that comes out Tuesday. The title is a line from the 1920s poem “The Creation” by James Weldon Johnson, whose most famous poem, “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing,” is known as the “Black National Anthem.”

Givens examines important themes in Black history and clarifies misconceptions around them.

The book and the research Givens dug up will tie into a “living history campaign” with Campaign Zero and Afro Charities, Mckesson said. The goal is to teach what Woodson believed — younger generations can become historians who can discern fact from fiction.

“When I grew up, the preservation of history was a historian’s job,” Mckesson said, adding his group’s campaign will teach young students how to record history.

How the ‘father of Black history’ might feel today

Born in 1875 to formerly enslaved parents, Woodson was among the first generation of Black Americans not assigned to bondage at birth. He grew up believing that education was a way to self-empowerment, said Robert Trent Vinson, director of the Carter G. Woodson Institute at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The second Black man to earn a doctorate at Harvard University — W.E.B. Du Bois was the first — Woodson was disillusioned by how Black history was dismissed. He saw that the memories and culture of less educated Black people were no less valuable, Vinson said.

When Woodson established Negro History Week in 1926, he was in an era where popular stereotypes like blackface and minstrelsy were filling in for actual knowledge of the Black experience, according to Vinson. This sparked the creation of Black history clubs and Woodson began inserting historical lessons “on the sly” in publications like the “Journal of Negro History” and the “Negro History Bulletin.”

“Outside the formal school structure, they’re having a separate school like in churches or in study groups,” Vinson said. “Or they’re sharing it with parents and saying, ‘you teach your young people this history.’ So, Woodson is creating a whole educational space outside the formal university.”

In 1976, for the week’s 50th anniversary, President Gerald Ford issued a message recognizing it as an entire month. There was pushback then over the gains the Civil Rights Movement had made, Givens said.

As for today’s backlash over Black and African American studies, Vinson believes Woodson would not be surprised. But, he would see it as a sign “you’re on the right track.”

“There’s a level of what he called ‘fugitivity,’ of sharing this knowledge and being strategic about it,” Vinson said. “There are other times like in this moment, Black History Month, where you can be more out and assertive, but be strategic about how you spread the information.”

Resistance to teaching Black history is something that seems to occur every generation, Mckesson said.

“We will go back to normalcy. We’ve seen these backlashes before,” Mckesson said. “And when I think about the informal networks of Black people who have always resisted, I think that is happening today.”
