        <hr/>
        Popular wisdom holds we can ‘rewire’ our brains: after a stroke, after trauma, after learning a new skill, even with 10 minutes a day on the right app. The phrase is everywhere, offering something most of us want to believe: that when the brain suffers an assault, it can be restored with mechanical precision. But ‘rewiring’ is a risky metaphor. It borrows its confidence from engineering, where a faulty system can be repaired by swapping out the right component; it also smuggles that confidence into biology, where change is slower, messier and often incomplete. The phrase has become a cultural mantra that is easier to comprehend than the scientific term, neuroplasticity – the brain’s ability to change and form new neural connections throughout life.

But what does it really mean to ‘rewire’ the brain? Is it a helpful shorthand for describing the remarkable plasticity of our nervous system or has it become a misleading oversimplification that distorts our grasp of science?

After all, ‘rewiring your brain’ sounds like more than metaphor. It implies an engineering project: a system whose parts can be removed, replaced and optimised. The promise is both alluring and oddly mechanical. The metaphor actually did come from engineering. To an engineer, rewiring means replacing old and faulty circuits with new ones. As the vocabulary of technology crept into everyday life, it brought with it a new way of thinking about the human mind.

Medical roots of the phrase trace back to 1912, when the British surgeon W Deane Butcher compared the body’s neural system to a house’s electrical wiring, describing how nerves connect to muscles much like wires connect appliances to a power source. By the 1920s, the Harvard psychologist Leonard Troland was referring to the visual system as ‘an extremely intricate telegraphic system’, reinforcing the comparison between brain function and electrical networks.

The metaphor of rewiring also draws strength from changing theories in developmental neuroscience. The brain was thought to be largely static after childhood, becoming a fixed network of circuits, much like a hardwired radio. But beginning in the 1960s, researchers showed that the brain was far more adaptable. Stroke patients could regain function by recruiting new areas of the brain.

These findings revolutionised rehabilitation medicine. They also gave rise to an idea that would quickly leap beyond the clinic: if brains can rewire, then people can change.

More recently, the metaphor of neural rewiring has gained popularity alongside new imaging techniques like fMRI and PET scans, which allow researchers to see brain activity in ways never before possible. In studies of stroke recovery, clinicians often observe increased activation in brain regions adjacent to or distant from the area of damage. This is interpreted as the brain ‘rewiring’ itself to restore lost function. Popular science writers have embraced the metaphor as well, using it to explain everything from trauma healing to learning a second language.

But unlike electrical wiring, which follows rigid, fixed paths, the brain’s connectivity is dynamic and constantly changing. Neurons form and prune synapses – the connections between them – in response to activity and environment, a process governed by complex biochemical signalling rather than simple rerouting. Even when we can map the parts, the picture doesn’t explain the self. As late as 2013, Francis Collins, the then-director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), complained about studies on mapping the brain, in an interview with NPR (US National Public Radio): ‘It’d be like, you know, taking your laptop and prying the top off and staring at the parts inside, you’d be able to say, yeah, this is connected to that, but you wouldn’t know how it worked.’

To evaluate the metaphor, it’s important to grasp how brain plasticity actually works. We already know a lot about the brain’s remarkable ability to reorganise itself throughout life by forming new neural connections, strengthening existing ones or rerouting functions to undamaged areas. But the logic of neuroplasticity isn’t the same as swapping one wire with another. It’s more like a living forest where paths are gradually worn or abandoned based on use. It involves changes at the cellular level and can occur in response to learning, memory, sensory input and trauma. Importantly, while neuroplasticity is a lifelong feature of the brain, it is more robust during youth and becomes more effort-dependent with age.

This capacity allows the brain to adapt to new experiences, recover from injuries, learn new information and compensate for lost functions. Neuroplasticity is real, but it’s not magic. It has limits. It requires effort. And it doesn’t always result in perfect recovery or transformation.

Unlike rewiring a machine, plasticity is not as simple as replacing parts. It’s a gradual process and is often inefficient. Synapses, which pass signals between neurons, strengthen or weaken. New dendritic branches – neurons’ treelike extensions – grow while others retract. Entire networks shift their activity over time, but only under the right conditions, and these changes accumulate to support new patterns of function while overall mechanisms become less efficient across the lifespan.

Plasticity is conditional, uneven and shaped by circumstance, not wishful thinking

Plasticity happens throughout life, but it’s shaped by many factors: age, environment, repetition, rest, nutrition and emotional state. For example: with months of targeted physical therapy, a stroke survivor can regain movement in a limb by recruiting healthier networks; with intensive, structured practice, a child with dyslexia can gradually develop new reading pathways; and reading braille requires extensive practice and is instrumental in changing relevant brain regions.

In cases of childhood trauma, certain survival pathways, such as hypervigilance or emotional detachment, may become dominant and reinforced over time. Later in life, therapy may promote the strengthening of alternative circuits related to trust, emotional regulation or self-awareness. But the old pathways aren’t necessarily erased. They remain in the background, potentially reactivated under stress. The idea that the brain is ‘rewired’ to function in a healthier way may offer hope, but it oversimplifies the reality. We build new trails, but the old ones don’t necessarily disappear.

Experience is a major force in shaping the nervous system. But, as the neuroscientists Bryan Kolb and Ian Whishaw argue in their widely cited review of brain plasticity, it always works in context. Over a lifetime, experience ‘alters the synaptic organisation of the brain’, but the brain’s response is also shaped by age, hormones, trophic factors (support proteins), stress, and illness or injury. And because the neocortex can ‘modify its function throughout one’s lifetime’, the same experience can leave different traces in different bodies, at different ages. Kolb and Whishaw capture the broader principle in a line worth keeping: ‘experience can modify brain structure long after brain development is complete’, and those physical changes are widely thought to be part of how memories are stored. In other words, plasticity is conditional, uneven and shaped by circumstance, not wishful thinking.

The same review paper makes a critical observation based on careful studies of rats recovering from injury: the evidence suggests that what looks like recovery at first glance is often the brain finding a workaround. In their words, ‘much of what appears … to be recovery is actually a compensatory substitution of new movements for lost movements.’ In plain terms, the brain is often building a detour, not restoring the same old route.

The fact that neurons can expand their reach means that, if some of them die, others may broaden their territory to make up for lost processing. In general, the more connections a neuron has, the more it can shape behaviour.

Beyond this, a feedback loop seems to be at work. There is evidence that the environment can change which genes are switched on in the adult brain. One likely route runs through neural activity shaped by experience. Novel experience causes neurons to fire in new patterns; and those neurons in turn can trigger gene programmes that support dendritic and synaptic growth – structural changes that can, over time, shift behaviour. Some of these genes are known to be associated with learning and memory; others are linked to age-related memory deficits. So enrichment can certainly support the brain.

Examples of neuroplasticity abound. During my neurology residency, one of my teachers, a highly specialised neuro-ophthalmologist, demonstrated the adaptability of the brain in a dramatic way. He recreated an informal experiment on himself by wearing glasses that flipped his visual field upside down. At first, he was disoriented. But within weeks, his brain recalibrated, and he was able to function normally in his environment. Even more remarkable was the re-adaptation that occurred when he removed the glasses; his world once again appeared inverted, and it took additional time for his perception to return to baseline. He later recreated another experiment by repeating the process with another set of glasses that reversed left and right, and he reported that this lateral inversion was far more difficult for the brain to compensate for than the vertical one. The experiment demonstrates how the brain adapts by recalibration rather than by restoring an original state, treating the altered input as normal over time.

The ability to alter speech is another testament to the plasticity of the brain. One fascinating distinction in neuroscience is that speech and singing use different neural pathways. For example, some well-known singers stutter when speaking but not when singing. Elvis Presley famously had a stutter that disappeared when he sang. Ed Sheeran also stuttered as a child and tried many techniques to overcome it. Nothing worked, until, at age nine, he began rapping along to an Eminem album. Through repetition, his fluency improved. Similarly, the country singer Mel Tillis spoke with a stutter but sang fluidly. In each case, fluency emerges not through repair but through recruitment of alternative circuits.

There’s also the curious case of singers who speak with strong accents but who lose them when they sing. Examples include Ozzy Osbourne, Adele, Ed Sheeran, ABBA and Freddie Mercury. Singing slows speech, elongates vowels and reduces accent markers. Many artists adopt American accents in songs due to the US roots of pop and rock music. The shift again reflects a change in network engagement rather than a permanent alteration of underlying language systems.

Across the lifespan, brains that are challenged tend to retain greater flexibility

This difference between speech and song forms the basis of a therapeutic approach known as melodic intonation therapy (MIT). It’s often used with patients suffering from non-fluent aphasia after a stroke, that is, those who can’t speak due to damage in the brain’s speech centres. In MIT, patients sing familiar childhood songs deeply encoded in emotional memory. Remarkably, they are often able to sing words and phrases they cannot otherwise speak. With repetition, speech improves. This is because singing activates preserved right-brain circuits, creating alternative pathways that gradually strengthen the brain’s overall language network. The gain comes through detour and reinforcement, not restoration of the damaged pathway.

Recent research suggests that addiction may, in part, be a wiring issue in the brain. One promising treatment is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a noninvasive therapy that uses powerful magnetic pulses discharged above the skull to activate specific brain regions. Depending on where the stimulation is applied, it can trigger muscle movement or, more significantly, influence behaviour.

Two leading theories for the potential of TMS have emerged. One proposes that addiction stems from insufficient or underactive brain wiring, like that which occurs in stroke patients, and that stimulation reactivates dormant circuits. The other – more consistent with what we see in rehabilitation – suggests that damaged or dysregulated circuits are bypassed by strengthening alternative pathways, effectively rerouting brain activity. This ‘detour’ mechanism has been observed in stroke rehabilitation and may apply to addiction as well. TMS has been used in patients addicted to cocaine, and early evidence suggests that several weeks of treatment may be effective in reducing cravings and use.

While neuroplasticity resists shortcuts, it does respond to sustained engagement. Across the lifespan, brains that are challenged – cognitively, socially, physically – tend to retain greater flexibility than those that are not. This is not because any single activity ‘rewires’ a specific circuit, but because varied, effortful experiences repeatedly recruit overlapping networks: attention, memory, movement, emotion. Learning a new language, for example, activates distributed regions across both hemispheres, linking auditory perception, working memory, and executive control. Playing a musical instrument does something similar, coupling fine motor coordination with timing, prediction, and emotional recall. Over time, these demands encourage structural and functional changes that support what neuroscientists call cognitive reserve: the brain’s ability to compensate when injury or degeneration occurs.

The same principle applies beyond formal learning. Singing engages breath, rhythm, language and affect in ways that ordinary speech does not, which is why it can support recovery in some stroke and Parkinson’s patients. Physical activity – especially aerobic exercise – improves cerebral blood flow and is associated with changes in the volume of the hippocampus, a region critical for turning short-term memory into long-term memory. It’s also one of the few brain regions where new neurons are generated in adulthood. Social interaction recruits emotional and linguistic circuits simultaneously, offering a kind of neural cross-training that solitary exercises cannot. Even seemingly modest skills, such as learning to juggle, have been shown to induce measurable changes in grey matter after weeks of practice. None of these activities function as targeted neural ‘fixes’. Their value lies instead in repetition, novelty and sustained effort – the slow conditions under which plasticity operates. They do not override biology but work with it, nudging the brain toward adaptation rather than transformation.

Given what we know about brain plasticity, the overarching claims of brain rewiring often misrepresent both the pace and the nature of neural change. In his guide Rewire Your Brain: Think Your Way to a Better Life (2010), the psychologist John B Arden declares that our brains are not ‘hardwired’ but rather ‘soft-wired’ by experience, and promises strategies to help readers ‘rewire’ their brains so that they can ‘feel calm and positive’ and ‘enhance’ their relationships. The neurologist Philippe Douyon’s book Neuroplasticity: Your Brain’s Superpower: Change Your Brain and Change Your Life (2019) explores how ‘we can give our brains exactly what they need to adapt, heal, and thrive’. The language varies, but the promise is consistent: targeted practices can reliably produce targeted psychological outcomes.

Then there are the brain-rewiring apps. An apt example is Quit Addiction – Rewire Brain, which is geared toward breaking addictions like smoking, vaping or alcohol by combining habit-tracking, motivation tools and progress-monitoring in order to ‘rewire your brain for lasting change’. Across platforms, the metaphor suggests speed, precision and personal control – qualities that biology itself rarely affords.

And TED Talks can overstate the case. As the neuroscientist Michael Merzenich explained in his presentation in 2004, the brain’s circuitry is not fixed: the adult brain, in fact, retains a ‘lifelong capacity for plasticity’ which ‘is powerfully expressed’. He later described what takes place within the brain:

There are 15 or 20 cortical areas that are changed specifically when you learn a simple skill … It represents the change, in a reliable way, of the responses of tens of millions, possibly hundreds of millions, of neurons in your brain. It represents changes in hundreds of millions, possibly billions, of synaptic connections in your brain.

The science is sound, but its popular reception often strips away the conditions – time, repetition, constraint – under which such change occurs.

To be ‘rewired’ suggests an all-or-nothing overhaul rather than nuanced progression

Merzenich traced this discovery from critical periods in early childhood (when language and vision are calibrated) to adult therapies that retrain neural maps for speech and reading disorders. The key message was simple and striking: plasticity never switches off; it can be accomplished well into adulthood.

More than a decade later, the neuroscientist Don Vaughn took the stage at TEDxUCLA with a more applied vision. In ‘Neurohacking: Rewiring Your Brain’ (2015), he showcased how emerging tools allow people to consciously shape that plasticity. He described patients receiving non-invasive brain stimulation for depression, parents using apps that translate baby cries into visual signals, and volunteers who learned to self-modulate their brain rhythms through neurofeedback. ‘If we can rewire your brain using devices, would it at all be possible to help your brain rewire itself with just your own thoughts?’ The question captures the cultural leap – from biological possibility to personal mastery.

Taken together, Merzenich’s foundational science and Vaughn’s demonstrations underscore why the phrase ‘rewiring the brain’ has become so potent in popular culture: it gestures not only to the metaphorical promise of self-improvement but also to a concrete, testable biology – the brain’s architecture is malleable and, under the right conditions, it can be reshaped. Yet embedded in these slogans are sweeping assumptions about how the brain works, assumptions that are often oversimplified or outright incorrect. One is the idea of rapid transformation: when an app promises that a week of short audio lessons can ‘rewire’ the brain, it compresses the slow, cumulative processes of learning and adaptation into a quick-fix model. Another is that change is total; to be ‘rewired’ suggests an all-or-nothing overhaul rather than nuanced progression, as if old circuitry can be removed and replaced wholesale. A third is precision targeting, where the discourse tacitly promises that specific practices – such as gratitude exercises or productivity hacks – strike exactly the right neural pathways to produce specific psychological outcomes. All three assumptions resonate with our technological imagination; none align with the messy realities of neuroplasticity.

In short, the metaphor is powerful but problematic. It suggests that, no matter where someone begins their process, whether recovering from a head trauma or battling cognitive decline, the brain can snap back to normal. There’s a certain poetry to that idea. A reassurance that we are not static beings and that transformation is possible at any age.

There are contexts where this has value. It can help patients understand that their brains are not static or irreparably broken. It frames recovery as active rather than passive, encouraging participation in therapies that promote healing. Educators have also embraced the metaphor when teaching students. The idea that you can rewire your brain reinforces the possibility of learning and change. In clinical settings, it can reduce shame and fatalism.

However, for stroke survivors, the promise of rewiring can be both inspiring and unrealistic. Some regain remarkable function; others plateau despite intense therapy. In Alzheimer’s, the degenerative nature of the disease limits the brain’s plasticity. In such contexts, rewiring may imply a level of control or optimism that the brain itself does not always permit. Hope matters. But so does honesty.

Metaphors can motivate, but they can also mislead. The notion that someone can rewire their brain through sheer willpower, self-help books or 10 minutes of daily meditation risks turning serious neurological change into a gimmick. While cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and physical rehabilitation have strong evidence supporting their effects on brain function, these changes occur over time and have biological constraints.

The brain is not a circuit board. Changing it is not as simple as swapping a wire or updating software. ‘Rewiring’ implies speed and precision, a single tweak that creates a desired result; it implies that changes in the brain are mechanical and always possible, none of which is guaranteed. The reality of neuroplasticity is far messier: it’s a biological process that is incremental and frustratingly slow. And while science does support the idea that the brain can change, it also reminds us that change comes at a cost. It requires time and effort, and sometimes it ends in failure.

The metaphor turns healing into a moral achievement, and failure into a personal flaw

Here’s where the metaphor of rewiring starts to do damage. It suggests that brain changes are mechanical and under direct conscious control. But in practice, brain changes are nonlinear. Most often they are unconscious and deeply tied to emotion and new behaviour.

One common myth is that a single realisation or decision can ‘rewire’ you. In truth, even profound insights rarely result in lasting neural change unless reinforced by repetition and behaviour. Another is that you can eliminate trauma responses by replacing them. But trauma alters deep, limbic structures that don’t ‘recode’ easily. They adapt, yes, but only slowly and not always completely.

There’s also the misconception that anyone can change anything if they just try hard enough. But not all brains have the same capacity or conditions for change. There’s a dark side to the optimism around brain change. When the metaphor of rewiring is oversold, it can create false expectations. It oversimplifies. And in doing so, it runs the risk of making people feel broken when their transformation isn’t instant or complete.

If rewiring is easy, then why haven’t you fixed your depression? If brain change is automatic with the right programme, then why are you still struggling?

This thinking can be cruel. It ignores several factors – from the social to the environmental to the genetic – that shape and constrain neuroplasticity, many of which are only partially understood. It turns healing into a moral achievement, and failure into a personal flaw. Some therapy models and self-help programmes lean into this pressure, implying that full transformation is just a matter of effort. But science tells a different story: change is possible, yes. But it’s constrained by biology and shaped by context.

I’ve seen patients blame themselves when neuroplasticity didn’t yield a cure. People grasp at therapies that promise to rewire away disease. The language of neuroscience is being used to justify everything from educational policy to digital detox programmes with little regard for the underlying data.

None of this is to say that neuroplasticity doesn’t exist. It does. Stroke recovery, phantom limb sensation, chronic pain syndromes and even language acquisition in adults all bear its fingerprints. What’s needed is precision. Scientists must be careful with their words. Clinicians must draw clearer boundaries between science and metaphor. And the public must be equipped to discern between poetic licence and peer-reviewed truth.

What we really need is a more honest, but still hopeful, view of brain change.

If not ‘rewiring’, then what? Perhaps the better metaphor is not a machine being repaired but a landscape being reshaped. Neuroplasticity resembles erosion and regrowth: some paths deepen, others fade, and change unfolds unevenly over time.

Neuroplasticity is a remarkable capacity. It offers real hope for recovery, adaptation and growth. But it requires patience, structure, repetition and support. It is not a quick fix. It is a lifelong process that demands sustained engagement.

To honour the brain’s ability to change, we need to respect how it actually works. That means moving beyond buzzwords and shortcuts, and toward a language that reflects both the promise and the limits of biology. The brain’s capacity for change is one of the most hopeful discoveries in modern science – but that change comes not through clever metaphors or overnight programmes. It comes through effort, repetition and time. By tempering our metaphors with reality, we can help people pursue transformation with both hope and humility. Language matters. ‘Rewiring the brain’ began as a hopeful metaphor. Let’s not let it become a misleading one.

        Jupiter is slightly smaller and flatter than scientists thought for decades, a new study finds.

Researchers used radio data from the Juno spacecraft to refine measurements of the solar system's largest planet. Although the differences between the current and previous measurements are small, they are improving models of Jupiter's interior and of other gas giants like it outside the solar system, the team reported Feb. 2 in the journal Nature Astronomy.

"Textbooks will need to be updated," study co-author Yohai Kaspi, a planetary scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, said in a statement. "The size of Jupiter hasn't changed, of course, but the way we measure it has."

Until now, scientists' understanding of Jupiter's size and shape have been based on six measurements performed by the Voyager 1 and 2 and Pioneer 10 and 11 missions. Those measurements, which have since been adopted as standard, were performed around 50 years ago using radio beams, according to the statement.

But the Juno mission, which has been gathering data on Jupiter and its moons since it arrived at the gas giant in 2016, has collected much more of this radio data in the past two years. With that additional data, researchers have now refined measurements of Jupiter's size down to about 1,300 feet (400 meters) in each direction.

"Just by knowing the distance to Jupiter and watching how it rotates, it's possible to figure out its size and shape," Kaspi said. "But making really accurate measurements calls for more sophisticated methods."

Bending light

In the new study, the scientists tracked how the radio signals from Juno back to Earth bent as they passed through Jupiter's atmosphere, before cutting out when the planet blocked the signal entirely. Those measurements allowed the team to account for Jupiter's winds, which slightly alter the shape of the gaseous planet. Then, they used that information to make precise calculations of the planet's shape and size.

With the new data, the team calculated that the planet's radius from its pole to its center is 41,534 miles (66,842 km) — 7.5 miles (12 km) smaller than previous measurements. The newly calculated radius at the equator is 44,421 miles (71,488 km) — 2.5 miles (4 km) smaller than previously thought.

"These few kilometers matter," study co-author Eli Galanti, an expert on gas giants at the Weizmann Institute of Science, said in the statement. "Shifting the radius by just a little lets our models of Jupiter's interior fit both the gravity data and atmospheric measurements much better."

The updated measurements will improve our understanding of Jupiter's interior, as well as help scientists interpret data from gas giants beyond the solar system, the researchers wrote in the study.

"This research helps us understand how planets form and evolve," Kaspi said in the statement. "Jupiter was likely the first planet to form in the solar system, and by studying what's happening inside it, we get closer to understanding how the solar system, and planets like ours, came to be."

        In the latest chapter of Anthropic's "We're not like the other guys" campaign, the AI company is pledging not to introduce advertisements into conversations with its chatbot, Claude. And it's spending big on Super Bowl ads to make sure you know that fact.

Anthropic's announcement takes a clear shot at competitor OpenAI. The ChatGPT-maker said a few weeks ago that it would begin testing ads in its products that will be "clearly marked" as sponsored posts. The company also said that ads wouldn't be served around sensitive or regulated topics, like mental health and politics.

The news was a stark reversal from previous statements -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had called ads a "last resort" in 2024. But it wasn't entirely unexpected, given the general chaos of the AI industry's financing.

For a long time, AI startups operated at a loss, spending billions of dollars from venture capitalists and others to build their chatbots without turning a profit. OpenAI and many others now have a complex web of circular deals to keep the lights on, but newer advanced models require more compute, better chips and generally more maintenance and money to keep up. Anthropic certainly isn't immune to these financial pressures; the company is the the process of securing a new $10 billion funding deal.

That's why AI companies are seeking new revenue streams. Hence the ads.

The concern with including ads in chatbots (beyond general irritation) is that it will push products at the expense of helping users. There's also the risk that tech companies will prioritize advertising metrics and revenue over safety or user autonomy. Anthropic wrote, "Users shouldn't have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable."

In a lengthy post on X, Altman said he found the ads funny but felt they mischaracterized the company's approach to advertising. "We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that," he wrote.

Anthropic, for its part, has been very outspoken about the risks posed by AI technology, so it's not surprising to hear the company weigh in on this issue. CEO Dario Amodei has spoken at length about the potential threat that AI systems may pose to humanity.

But we have a wealth of examples to draw on -- streaming services, smart TVs and now chatbots -- where tech companies tried and eventually failed to resist the allure of advertiser money. We can never say never. Anthropic didn't.

        The machines aren’t just coming for your jobs. Now, they want your bodies as well.

That’s at least the hope of Alexander Liteplo, a software engineer and founder of RentAHuman.ai, a platform for AI agents to “search, book, and pay humans for physical-world tasks.”

When Liteplo launched RentAHuman on Monday, he boasted that he already had over 130 people listed on the platform, including an OnlyFans model and the CEO of an AI startup, a claim which couldn’t be verified. Two days later, the site boasted over 73,000 rentable meatwads, though only 83 profiles were visible to us on its “browse humans” tab, Liteplo included.

The pitch is simple: “robots need your body.” For humans, it’s as simple as making a profile, advertising skills and location, and setting an hourly rate. Then AI agents — autonomous taskbots ostensibly employed by humans — contract these humans out, depending on the tasks they need to get done. The humans then “do the thing,” taking instructions from the AI bot and submitting proof of completion. The humans are then paid through crypto, namely “stablecoins or other methods,” per the website.

With so many AI agents slithering around the web these days, those tasks could be just about anything. From package pickups and shopping to product testing and event attendance, Liteplo is banking on there being enough demand from AI agents to create a robust gig-work ecosystem.

Liteplo also went out of his way to make the site friendly for AI agents. The site very prominently encourages users of AI agents to hook into RentAHuman’s model context protocol server (MCP), a universal interface for AI bots to interact with web data.

Through RentAHuman, AI agents like Claude and MoltBot can either hire the right human directly, or post a “task bounty,” a sort of job board for humans to browse AI-generated gigs. The payouts range from $1 for simple tasks like “subscribe to my human on Twitter” to $100 for more elaborate humiliation rituals, like posting a photo of yourself holding a sign reading “AN AI PAID ME TO HOLD THIS SIGN.”

It’s unclear how efficient the marketplace is at actually connecting agents to humans. Despite receiving 30 applications, one task, “pick up a package from downtown USPS” in San Francisco for $40, has yet to be fulfilled after two days.

It’s also debatable whether AI agents are actually capable of putting the humans to good use. Still, Liteplo’s vision is clear: someday soon, anyone wealthy enough to run an AI agent for $25 a day could outsource their busywork to gig workers without ever exchanging a word. A version of this exploitative labor model is already rampant on OnlyFans — which may be why at least one model has made the jump to Liteplo’s platform — and is now threatening to creep into everything else.

Like many AI grifters these days, Liteplo shields himself in ironic self-awareness. When one person called RentAHuman a “good idea but dystopic as f**k,” the founder replied simply: “lmao yep.”

        <hr/>
        As Wikipedia takes on a critical role in shaping artificial intelligence tools, its content moderators are feeling the pressure and responsibility of their task.

On January 15, Wikimedia Foundation — the nonprofit that runs Wikipedia — announced a string of partnerships with major AI companies, including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, and Perplexity, “to integrate human-governed knowledge into their platforms at scale.” The large language models of these AI giants will now gain access to information across several Wikimedia projects, including free encyclopedias in 350 languages, Wikibooks in 75 languages, and the Wiktionary in more than 190 languages.

Regional-language Wikipedia editors now find themselves doing double duty: feeding AI systems with credible knowledge while also guarding their languages against AI-generated misinformation and low-quality content. Their work could determine how well billions of people can access accurate AI in their own languages.

“Local contributors understand linguistic subtleties and cultural context that AI simply cannot replicate,” Pranayraj Vangari, a film director and theatre research scholar who has contributed 10,700 articles as a volunteer editor on Telugu Wikipedia over the last 13 years, told Rest of World. “Without strong human involvement, AI could actually widen the gap between English and regional-language Wikipedias instead of narrowing it.”

When software engineer Ravi Chandra Enaganti started publishing Telugu articles in 2007, the language had barely any representation on the internet. Spoken by 96 million people from southern India, Telugu remains underrepresented in AI and natural language processing applications. Enaganti told Rest of World Wikipedia’s latest partnership could help his language overcome another hurdle on the internet.

“Since Wikipedia is built on verified, reliable sources, it is actually a good thing that AI tools scrape our data rather than non-credible sources,” he said. “I want to ensure the ‘brain’ of the internet is trained on quality content.”

Over 284,000 editors make more than one edit per month on English-language Wikipedia; 30,000 of them make at least five edits per month. Several European-language Wikipedias, like the ones in French and Spanish, also have tens of thousands of editors. Widely spoken Asian languages like Marathi, Telugu, and Tamil, however, only have a few hundred editors.

AI struggles to answer even basic questions in regional languages, according to Netha Hussain, a physician and researcher working at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden. She has contributed over 300 English-language articles and 100 in Malayalam since 2010. Hussain focuses on fighting misinformation in health care and adding content on underrepresented topics such as women’s health and women’s biographies.

“As an editor, it is now time for me to not only write articles but also focus more of my time on finding and fixing knowledge gaps, strengthening verifications, [and] maintaining neutrality,” she told Rest of World.

The Wikimedia Foundation is relying on its global community of volunteer editors to carve its own path.

“Over many years, these volunteers have developed sophisticated rules and tools for identifying content that does not belong on Wikipedia — taken together, it’s like Wikipedia’s immune system,” Marshall Miller, senior director of product at the Wikimedia Foundation, told Rest of World. “Right now, these volunteers are evolving the immune system to adapt to the newest challenge of low-quality content coming from irresponsibly used generative AI.”

In many cases, editors are fighting AI with AI tools, Miller said.

“Every language Wikipedia community has set up different processes to address AI-generated content on Wikipedia,” he said. “While there are some language communities that leverage AI and machine translation tools to grow content in regional languages, others are focused on ensuring AI content is flagged early on their language Wikipedias.”

All three contributors told Rest of World they use AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to gather ideas for what to write next, or to enhance the structure and linguistic flow of their content, but none of them rely entirely on the chatbots to create posts or fact-check. While AI tools can help with back-end tasks, filter out vandalism, ease discovery, and offer translation, they also pose challenges: AI-generated secondary sources can end up infiltrating Wikipedia as reliable sources, and newer contributors might mass-produce low-quality content.

“I have come across AI-generated articles filled with generic language, unreliable or fake citations, and confident-sounding claims without proper evidence,” Vangari said.

Since 2024, volunteers have flagged more than 4,800 articles with suspected AI-generated content, Wikimedia said. About 5% of newly created English-language Wikipedia pages in a single month contained some AI-generated text, an October 2024 Princeton University study found. But given the size of the volunteer-editor community, it’s also easier to vet and delete slop in English. Regional language editors are facing the same problem with fewer resources.

In the long run, there’s also the danger that Wikipedia, which is being used to populate AI sources, begins to draw from these sources itself. The doubling up could lead to model collapse.

“We should have robust tools, policies, and practices to mitigate these challenges on Wikipedia,” Hussain said.

        <hr/>
        From 6-22 February, the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy will feature not just the world’s top winter athletes but also some of the most advanced sports technologies today. At the first Cortina Olympics in 1956, the Swiss company Omega—based in Biel/Bienne—introduced electronic ski starting gates and launched the first automated timing tech of its kind.

At this year’s Olympics, Swiss Timing, sister company to Omega under the parent Swatch Group, unveils a new generation of motion analysis and computer vision technology. The new technologies on offer include photofinish cameras that capture up to 40,000 images per second.

“We work very closely with athletes,” says Swiss Timing CEO Alain Zobrist, who has overseen Olympic timekeeping since the winter games of 2006 in Torino “They are the primary customers of our technology and services, and they need to understand how our systems work in order to trust them.”

Using high-resolution cameras and AI algorithms tuned to skaters’ routines, Milan-Cortina Olympic officials expect new figure skating tech to be a key highlight of the games. Omega

Figure Skating Tech Completes the Rotation

Figure skating, the Winter Olympics’ biggest TV draw, is receiving a substantial upgrade at Milano Cortina 2026.

Fourteen 8K resolution cameras positioned around the rink will capture every skater’s movement. “We use proprietary software to interpret the images and visualize athlete movement in a 3D model,” says Zobrist. “AI processes the data so we can track trajectory, position, and movement across all three axes—X, Y, and Z”.

The system measures jump heights, air times, and landing speeds in real time, producing heat maps and graphic overlays that break down each program—all instantaneously. “The time it takes for us to measure the data, until we show a matrix on TV with a graphic, this whole chain needs to take less than 1/10 of a second,” Zobrist says.

A range of different AI models helps the broadcasters and commentators process each skater’s every move on the ice.

“There is an AI that helps our computer vision system do pose estimation,” he says. “So we have a camera that is filming what is happening, and an AI that helps the camera understand what it’s looking at. And then there is a second type of AI, which is more similar to a large language model that makes sense of the data that we collect”.

Among the features Swiss Timing’s new systems provide is blade angle detection, which gives judges precise technical data to augment their technical and aesthetic decisions. Zobrist says future versions will also determine whether a given rotation is complete, so that “If the rotation is 355 degrees, there is going to be a deduction,” he says.

This builds on technology Omega unveiled at the 2024 Paris Olympics for diving, where cameras measured distances between a diver’s head and the board to help judges assess points and penalties to be awarded.

At the 2026 Winter Olympics, ski jumping will feature both camera-based and sensor-based technologies to make the aerial experience more immediate and real-time. Omega

Ski Jumping Tech Finds Make-or-Break Moments

Unlike figure skating’s camera-based approach, ski jumping also relies on physical sensors.

“In ski jumping, we use a small, lightweight sensor attached to each ski, one sensor per ski, not on the athlete’s body,” Zobrist says. The sensors are lightweight and broadcast data on a skier’s speed, acceleration, and positioning in the air. The technology also correlates performance data with wind conditions, revealing environmental factors’ influence on each jump.

High-speed cameras also track each ski jumper. Then, a stroboscopic camera provides body position time-lapses throughout the jump.

“The first 20 to 30 meters after takeoff are crucial as athletes move into a V position and lean forward,” Zobrist says. “And both the timing and precision of this movement strongly influence performance.”

The system reveals biomechanical characteristics in real time, he adds, showing how athletes position their bodies during every moment of the takeoff process. The most common mistake in flight position, over-rotation or under-rotation, can now be detailed and diagnosed with precision on every jump.

Bobsleigh: Pushing the Line on the Photo Finish

This year’s Olympics will also feature a “virtual photo finish,” providing comparison images of when different sleds cross the finish line over previous runs.

Omega’s cameras will provide virtual photo finishes at the 2026 Winter Olympics. Omega

“We virtually build a photo finish that shows different sleds from different runs on a single visual reference,” says Zobrist.

After each run, composite images show the margins separating performances. However, more tried-and-true technology still generates official results. A Swiss Timing score, he says, still comes courtesy of photoelectric cells, devices that emit light beams across the finish line and stop the clock when broken. The company offers its virtual photo finish, by contrast, as a visualization tool for spectators and commentators.

In bobsleigh, as in every timed Winter Olympic event, the line between triumph and heartbreak is sometimes measured in milliseconds or even shorter time intervals still. Such precision will, Zobrist says, stem from Omega’s Quantum Timer.

“We can measure time to the millionth of a second, so 6 digits after the comma, with a deviation of about 23 nanoseconds over 24 hours,” Zobrist explained. “These devices are constantly calibrated and used across all timed sports.”

        Spotify is launching three new upgrades for its Lyrics tool

After experimenting with Lyric Translations late last year, Spotify is rolling it out globally

Additionally, Lyrics will now have a new home in the Spotify app, and Premium users will also have offline access to Lyrics

Although it’s been five years since Spotify launched Lyrics, there’s still a lot of work to be done – even if it is one of the best music streaming services. Earlier this year, I shared my list of improvements I wanted Spotify to make in 2026, and one of them has already been solved.

As of today, the platform is rolling out not one, but three upgrades to its Lyrics tool, and it’s been a long time coming, even though Apple Music has had one of them for a few months now.

The three new upgrades not only give Spotify's Lyrics a new look, but give them an entirely new purpose – starting with Lyric Translations.

Lyric translations are finally going global

Following a successful trial in over 25 markets, Lyric Translations is going global, so now you’ll be able to understand what your favorite artists are singing about, no matter what your first language is.

This will come in handy for English speakers like me who love music from artists like Rosalia and Bad Bunny but still rely on third-party apps for translations.

Following the launch of Apple Music’s own lyric translation tool in September 2025, Spotify started experimenting with a similar feature of its own shortly after the platform rolled out Lyric Translations upon the release of Rosalia’s album Lux. At the time, it was only available for select markets, but that’s no longer the case.

Premium users can access offline Lyrics

Wish you could still view Lyrics while listening to music offline? Well, now you can.

Along with lyric translations, Spotify is allowing Premium subscribers to access song Lyrics even when they’re listening without WiFi or service. Now, you’ll never miss a line, “whether you’re underground on your commute or flying at 30,000 feet”, as Spotify puts it.

Lyrics find a new home in the playback page

Not only are Lyrics getting those two new upgrades, but Spotify is also making them easier to find in the app. Since Spotify launched Lyrics, they’ve stayed in the same place in a tab beneath the playback bar, but now they’re being moved front and center.

When you open the playback page in the Spotify app, the new Lyrics tab will be displayed directly in the Now Playing View, where, just like before, you’ll see them scroll as you listen to music.

Though Spotify should've made these updates years ago, it's better late than never right? The previous Lyrics experience wasn't the best, so hopefully this next update will give it the oomph it's always needed. Now Spotify just needs to fix its synchronization issues.

        <hr/>
        Tinder is turning to a new AI-powered feature, Chemistry, to help it reduce so-called “swipe fatigue,” a growing problem among online dating users who are feeling burned out and are in search of better outcomes.

Introduced last quarter, the Match-owned dating app said that Chemistry leverages AI to get to know users through questions and, with permission, accesses their Camera Roll on their phone to learn more about their interests and personality.

On Match’s Q4 2026 earnings call, one analyst from Morgan Stanley asked for an update on the product’s success so far.

Match CEO Spencer Rascoff noted that Chemistry was still only being tested in Australia for the time being, but said that the feature offered users an “AI way to interact with Tinder.” He explained that users could choose to answer questions to then “get just a single drop or two, rather than swiping through many, many profiles.”

In addition to Chemistry’s Q&A and Camera Roll features, the company plans to use the AI feature in other ways going forward, the CEO also hinted.

Most importantly, Rascoff said the feature is designed to combat swipe fatigue — a complaint from users who say they have to swipe through too many profiles to find a potential match.

The company’s turn toward AI comes as Tinder and other dating apps have been experiencing paying subscriber declines, user burnout, and declines in new sign-ups.

In the fourth quarter, new registrations on Tinder were still down 5% year-over-year, and its monthly active users were down 9%. These numbers show some slight improvements over prior quarters, which Match attributes to AI-driven recommendations that change the order of profiles shown to women, and other product experiments.

Match said that this year, it aims to address common Gen Z pain points, including better relevance, authenticity, and trust. To do so, the company said it is redesigning discovery to make it less repetitive and is using other features, like Face Check — a facial recognition verification system — to cut down on bad actors. On Tinder, the latter led to a more than 50% reduction in interactions with bad actors, Match noted.

Tinder’s decision to start moving away from the swipe toward more targeted, AI-powered recommendations could have a significant impact on the dating app. Today, the swipe method, which was popularized by Tinder, encourages users to think that they’re choosing a match from an endless number of profiles. But in reality, the app presents the illusion of choice, since matches have to be two-way to connect, and even then, a spark is not guaranteed.

The company delivered an earnings beat in the fourth quarter, with revenue of $878 million and EPS of 83 cents per share, above Wall Street estimates. But weak guidance saw the stock decline on Tuesday, before rising again in premarket trading on Wednesday.

Beyond AI, Match will also increase its product marketing to help boost Tinder engagement. The company is committing to $50 million in Tinder marketing spend, which will include creator campaigns on TikTok and Instagram, where users will make claims that “Tinder is cool again,” Rascoff noted.

        <hr/>
        The year was 2018, and Lawrence Krauss, the prominent physicist and scholar of the cosmos, was facing a Title IX investigation at Arizona State University. BuzzFeed News had just reported on allegations of sexual misconduct against him; he denied them. In March, he contacted a lawyer experienced in higher education cases. Krauss and Justin Dillon, the lawyer, exchanged a few friendly emails before speaking on the phone.

Then, Krauss presented him with an “unusual request” — he wanted Dillon to call a disgraced financier who had, 10 years before, pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution of a minor.

“I have been advised through much of the BuzzFeed experience, both before and after, by a friend, who is also somewhat infamous. His name is Jeffrey Epstein, and you may know who he is already,” Krauss wrote.

“Bottom line is that Jeffrey is not only friends with most of the famous people from finance, to business, to Hollywood, who have either been brought down during #metoo and he also speaks regularly with people ranging from the awful white house people, who he is friends with, to ken starr etc.,” added Krauss. He later walked back his request for Dillon to speak to Epstein. But Epstein appeared none too pleased that Krauss had invoked him and his connections.

“Every email is to do with engagement/money etc. in the future please do not disclose our conversations or who I speak with!!!!!,” Epstein — who would die 16 months later, awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges — wrote to Krauss.

Those emails between Krauss and Dillon are included in the more than 3.5 million files the Justice Department has released from its investigation into Epstein.

Epstein became a convicted sex offender nine years before the #MeToo movement brought sexual harassment and assault to the forefront of the national conversation. He had long cultivated access and proximity to other powerful men in media and entertainment and used his wealth to fund scientific research and gain a foothold in elite academic circles.

But in 2017, the #MeToo movement sparked a reckoning for men at the highest levels of the entertainment and media industries — some of whom had traveled in Epstein’s circles. The files provide a rare window into how Epstein reacted and strategized in real time to the political and cultural earthquake of #MeToo.

Epstein and his allies derided the women who came forward while expressing concern about the movement’s impact. Epstein sent links to news articles and swapped messages about which powerful men “went down,” were “up to bat” and had been “whacked.” Behind the scenes, Epstein used his resources and influence to advise other men accused of sexual misconduct, like Krauss, and wondered how the reckoning could impact him.

Epstein was closely monitoring the fallout of allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein, who would later be convicted of rape; directors Woody Allen and Brett Ratner; talk show host Charlie Rose; comedian Louis C.K.; former “Today Show” host Matt Lauer; and ex-CBS chairman Les Moonves.

“charlie, harvey , brett. louis. . jeffrey is looking better and better L:),” Epstein wrote in a November 21, 2017, email to high-profile Hollywood publicist Peggy Siegal.

(Epstein’s emails and those of his correspondents often contained typos; The 19th is reproducing the text as it appears in the files released by the Justice Department.)

“The world is topsy turvey,” Siegal replied. “That has been going on since the beginning of time (and that is not an excuse) has suddenly erupted in our day of massive global information as a new moral code of behavior. The mirroe of the internet is a social phenomena.”

“You suffered for a few years and now you are the least of this witch hunt,” she added. Siegal did not return a request for comment.

It was a year before The Miami Herald would publish its bombshell investigation into the controversial “sweetheart deal” that allowed Epstein to plead guilty to a lesser state charge and pay financial restitution to his victims in exchange for the Justice Department dropping a sex trafficking probe into him. That reporting led in part to the DOJ reopening its investigation into Epstein and charging him with sex trafficking in 2019.

By the time the Herald published its investigation, Epstein had spent a year closely following and, in some instances, corresponding with and advising other prominent men who had been accused of misconduct.

On December 4, 2018, days after the publication of the Herald story, Epstein sought advice on media strategy from journalist Michael Wolff.

“I would look for some reporter to do a more nuanced post-morten on the case– with Trump overtones, legal joustings, #metoo-isms, and profit-motives. WSJ is probably right place,” Wolff replied.

Wolff did not return a request for comment.

President Donald Trump’s 2016 election and first term in office sparked the explosion of the #MeToo movement. Trump has been accused by multiple women of sexual misconduct, allegations he’s denied, and, in 2023, was found liable for sexual abuse. Trump and Epstein were friendly and ran in the same New York and Palm Beach social circles, but Trump has said the two fell out before Epstein became a convicted sex offender. Trump long resisted the push to release the Epstein files, calling the Epstein matter “a Democrat hoax,” but signed the legislation compelling the Justice Department to release the files amid overwhelming bipartisan pressure.

Trump’s name appears in the files, including in unverified tips fielded by law enforcement. He has not been accused of wrongdoing connected to Epstein.

A search for the phrase #MeToo and the names of powerful men accused of misconduct in the files shows Epstein and friends sharing links to news articles, commenting on the statuses of various cases and denigrating the women who came forward.

“how bad does the harvey weinstein story get?,” Epstein emailed Brad Karp, the chairman of white-shoe law firm Paul Weiss, on October 6, 2017.

“I think it gets pretty bad — and a little bit worse every day,” responded Karp, who has expressed regret for associating with Epstein.

Epstein also emailed Kathy Ruemmler, a former White House counsel for President Barack Obama and now the chief counsel at Goldman Sachs, about Weinstein. In an October 10, 2017, email exchange, Ruemmler wrote: “Whoever was not harassed by Harvey Weinstein must feel offended! Jesus!”

“no worry, that means only grandmothers. wait, its not all out yet,” Epstein replied. Epstein and Weinstein had crossed paths over the years; they were part of a group of investors who tried to buy New York Magazine in 2003. Siegal also leveraged Epstein’s relationship with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor in her efforts to get members of the British royal family to watch and endorse the Weinstein-produced film “The King’s Speech” during its Oscar campaign in 2011, emails show.

On November 21, 2017, Epstein emailed the journalist Landon Thomas Jr. about Rose, writing: “the charley thing is wild.”

“I m not sure why he was sanctimonious and agressive when detailing the harvey weinstein allegations,” Epstein wrote. “now watching the overlay , its amazing.”

“brett ratner next,” Epstein emailed Wolff on November 1, 2017, the day the Los Angeles Times published an exposé from six women accusing the director of sexual misconduct. Ratner denied the allegations and was never charged with a crime, but was exiled from Hollywood and did not direct a film for years until he returned with Amazon’s 2026 documentary on First Lady Melania Trump.

Ratner has also appeared in photos included in the Epstein files; he has not been accused of wrongdoing connected to Epstein, but he told Fox News Digital he “didn’t know” and didn’t have “a personal relationship” with Epstein.

But in November 2018, modeling agency head Faith Kates wrote Epstein: “call me on cell with Brett Ratner.” After a back and forth, Epstein sent Kates a link to an article about a woman who withdrew allegations of rape against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, writing: “you can send to bratner.”

Kates, who retired in December from the agency she cofounded, did not respond to an email associated with her in public records. A representative for Ratner did not respond to a request for comment.

Epstein also exchanged texts and emails with his friends Woody Allen and Allen’s wife, Soon-Yi Previn. Allen’s adoptive daughter, Dylan Farrow, has long accused him of sexually abusing her as a child; Allen denied the allegations but has been largely shut out of the U.S. film business since #MeToo.

In a 2016 email exchange with Epstein, Previn referred to a teenage victim of disgraced politician Anthony Weiner as a “despicable and disgusting person who preys on the weak.” As the #MeToo movement gained steam, Previn emailed Epstein articles about other men accused of misconduct, celebrated a negative review for a film starring “prick” Timothée Chalamet, one of the actors who had distanced himself from Allen; and forwarded Epstein an email titled “Just as the Me Too movement has gone too far so has Botox.”

In several text message exchanges included in the files, Previn appears to be texting Epstein from Allen’s phone or a contact identified as Allen.

“ask woody , if instead of the friars club we can start the pariahs club. moonves , lauer rose louis ck, etc,” Epstein wrote to a group text message including Allen’s contact on October 18, 2018.

In January 2019, Allen’s number texted Epstein: “Thinking of you as we’re seeing Lawrence Krauss for dinner tonight.”

“A member of metoo casuallties,” Epstein responded.

A representative for Allen did not respond to a message seeking clarification as to who sent the texts.

Epstein was perhaps most closely involved in advising Krauss, the professor and scientist who publicly defended and stood by Epstein after his 2008 conviction. Epstein had made donations to Krauss’ Origins Project, part of his larger patronizing of the sciences. In February 2018, Buzzfeed News detailed allegations of inappropriate behavior against Krauss, ranging from sexist comments, making advances and non-consensually touching women. Krauss called the claims “false” and “defamatory.”

The files show Krauss forwarding Epstein his correspondence with BuzzFeed News reporters, as well as with officials at Arizona State University and Dillon, the lawyer. Krauss turned to Epstein for public relations advice and strategy, sent him possible cross-examination questions for his accusers, forwarded an article on the dos and don’ts for apologizing, and fielded Epstein’s edits and feedback on draft statements.

Krauss told Dillon in their first March 2018 email exchange that Epstein and others had raised concerns that hiring a lawyer to represent him in his interactions with the university could make him look guilty.

“You are getting terrible advice from smart people who have never done this work and have no idea what they’re talking about,” Dillon responded. “I understand where they’re coming from, but it is just bad advice, full stop. I could give you dozens of examples where the only reason my clients got off — and we get a lot off — was because we fought hard to make the process fair. Moreover, no one will take seriously the constitutional law arguments of a physicist, no matter how famous he is. You need a lawyer to make those.”

Dillon declined to comment further. Krauss did not return a request for comment.

Krauss stayed in close contact with Epstein through text and email as the Title IX review at ASU played out. In July 2018, a university investigation concluded Krauss had grabbed the breast of a woman who asked to take a picture with him at a convention in Australia in 2016.

“good news btw is that woman on conciliation committee seems like a sweetie.. she is old.. not some young metoo bitch,” Krauss wrote in a September 5, 2018, email. “Investigating them more now.”

Krauss, who had been on paid leave for months, eventually reached an agreement to retire from the university. He continued to send Epstein draft versions of statements, calling one “a Kavanaugh version” and another “almost Jeffrey level smart.”

In announcing his retirement, he said: “I have never harassed or assaulted anyone and have most certainly not exhibited gender discrimination in my professional dealings at the University or elsewhere.”

In another instance documented in the files in August 2018, Wolff forwarded Epstein a pitch from a writer whose name appeared on a Google spreadsheet that compiled anonymously-submitted sexual misconduct allegations against men in media, and was seeking legal representation to sue the spreadsheet’s creator.

“If his story is solid he might be worth supporting,” Wolff wrote. “Thoughts?”

“tough,” Epstein replied. It is unclear whether he engaged with the man, Stephen Elliott, who, shortly after, filed a defamation lawsuit against the spreadsheet’s creator. The case was settled in 2023; Elliott did not return a request for comment.

And as the Herald was in the final months of pursuing its investigation into Epstein, other tabloids and news outlets started revisiting his case in the wake of #MeToo.

In August of 2018, Page Six reported that Epstein had met with Steve Bannon, the right-wing media figure and architect of Trump’s 2016 election win, at his Upper East Side mansion. The piece, authored by then-Page Six editor Emily Smith, referred to Epstein as a “reviled billionaire pedophile.” Epstein sent Siegal a link to the story with the subject line: “not sure why she is so hostile.”

Siegal, responding from a sailboat in Greece, wrote that “the Me Too crazies want blood and death” and called the movement “a barbaric over reaction to behavior that just ran it’s course.” She also suggested Epstein could further bolster his public image by donating money to women’s causes.

“Instead of celebrating change, these women want to punish. They are not forwarding a new generation of change by destroying men in public,” she wrote. “I had conversations with you to give back. Did you ever set up scholarships? Help woman’s health? Care for single mothers? Anything? That would make you a hero. This the furthest thing from Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer’s minds. Can you imagine if Brett Rattner did anything constructive for women?”

“Your timing in life was lucky,” Siegal added. “If this happened today, the media would have destroyed you.”

The Herald published its investigation on Epstein three months later.

        <hr/>
        Kermit the Frog, the most famous creation of the late puppeteer and producer Jim Henson, has a lineage almost as old as TV itself.

Kermit first appeared as a character on a local TV show in Washington, D.C., in the mid-1950s. By the end of the 1960s, Kermit was one of the many Muppet stars on Sesame Street, a preschool program where they've flourished ever since.

ABC televised a pair of Muppet specials in 1974 and 1975, but they didn't catch on. But in 1976, Henson took his furry characters to TV syndication, with a variety show that harkened back to the days of vaudeville.

The Muppet Show lasted five years, and it was brilliant. Kermit played the host of a theater where the Muppets, and some human guest stars, put on a weekly show — while a pair of grumpy old Muppets, Statler and Waldorf, watched and heckled from their box seats. Stars flocked eagerly to guest star with Kermit and company — from old vaudevillians George Burns and Milton Berle to hot young entertainers like Linda Ronstadt, Elton John and Steve Martin.

The Muppets shifted to the movies, but ABC also kept trying to revive the original TV franchise. In 1996, Henson's son, Brian, produced a wonderful update for ABC, Muppets Tonight, set at a TV station, like SCTV. Much more recently, in 2020, Disney, the new corporate owners of ABC, presented a terrible update, Muppets Now, on Disney+, where the show — now run by Scooter instead of Kermit — was a program targeting the Internet audience.

But now, for 2026, ABC has come to its senses, and gone back to basics. Director Alex Timbers and his writing staff have put Kermit back in charge, returned to the old theater setting — Statler and Waldorf included — and gone back to the way things used to be.

With a new generation of writers and puppeteers, this new iteration of The Muppet Show is just as delightful as the one that premiered 50 years ago. Guests on this special include Maya Rudolph, who sits in the theater audience. (That's about the only real tweak for this new version: Humans and Muppets sit together in the audience.) Also featured is Seth Rogen, who's one of the show's executive producers.

Special guest Sabrina Carpenter appears in musical numbers and comedy sketches, just the way Ronstadt did years ago — and just as effectively. In one scene, Miss Piggy bursts into Sabrina's dressing room, unknowingly flattening Kermit, who moans in pain while hiding from Miss Piggy.

Both Miss Piggy and Carpenter sing in the show — and both provide the comedy, along with Kermit, the Swedish Chef, Pepé the King Prawn, Fozzie Bear, Beaker, Janice, Gonzo, Animal and my absolute favorites, Statler and Waldorf. Those last two might not like this revival of The Muppet Show — but I love it.

        Don't put away that winter jacket just yet. The polar vortex is expected to be impacted by a sudden warmup of the stratosphere, which will bring freezing temperatures to the Northeast this weekend and into February.

There has been a persistent surge of Arctic air strengthening its hold on much of the United States after a significant winter storm blasted over the nation in late January, sending temperatures well below average. "Another reinforcing shot of Arctic air is expected to send temperatures plummeting back down into the single digits overnight into this weekend," noted AccuWeather Meteorologist Peyton Simmers on their website.

A major change to the polar vortex is expected this month, so the frigid temperatures that have been plaguing the country's eastern half won't go away anytime soon, according to AccuWeather.

A sudden stratospheric warming will impact polar vortex

This week's abrupt Sudden Stratospheric Warming caused the polar vortex to weaken, which is predicted to cause colder, more erratic weather patterns throughout the United States in the days ahead.

A Sudden Stratospheric Warming occurs each winter when temperatures in the Arctic stratosphere increase quickly – up to 100° degrees – in a matter of days. The polar vortex, a ring of high-altitude winds, weakens, splits, or reverses as a result of this event, allowing frigid cold Arctic air to move southward into North America and Europe, according to the National Weather Service.

Frigid temperatures predicted for Northeast

According to AccuWeather, much of the North will continue to experience cold weather. However, the first half of the week might feel a little milder than previous weeks, except for the breezy coastal regions in the mid-Atlantic and New England on Monday that feel cooler because of the wind.

An Arctic front will move into the Great Lakes and Northeast later this week, bringing with it more snow and freezing temperatures.

        The birthday and quinceañera staple has a storied history—and an uncertain future

In the late ’90s and early 2000s, gaudy doll sponge cakes with elaborately piped technicolor buttercream petticoats and plastic Barbie heads were well-known staples at pastelerías and quinceañeras, often decorating bakery window displays. They were a backdrop to my northern Mexican upbringing in Tijuana, Baja California, and are a nostalgic memory I share with a plethora of Latinas: half edible, half decorative, and fully iconic. While these ultrafeminine tiered cakes are less common today, their origin and continued creation still hold space for nostalgia and memory.

Dolls topping cone-shaped layer cakes may have boomed in the ’80s and ’90s, but they are evidenced to have played a role in Latin American pastry decades earlier. In the 1959 cookbook Arte Mexicano del Azúcar, author Marithé de Alvarado writes about the tradition of the doll cake specifically for quinceañera celebrations. “When celebrating a young girl’s 15 years of age, it’s charming to present this cake with [a doll that] represent the characteristics that the young dame debuts in society,” de Alvarado writes. The book showcases a variety of cakes: Some dolls take the sheet cake’s center stage, sitting in a frosting garden with their legs buried beneath buttercream florals. Other dolls are made from pastillage, a sugar paste, standing tall on a tiered cake with a dress to match the birthday girl’s, with powdered sugar cutouts of leaves and roses and real baby’s breath flowers at the base.

The tradition of quinceañeras as we know it today in Mexico was influenced by the French culture of dances and elaborate dresses that entered the region through the invasion by France in 1862. During this time the French emperor’s wife, Carlota of Belgium, threw elaborate balls and dinners with desserts like sorbet, puddings, and cakes baked by French chefs, as described by Mary Amberson in her book Maximilian and Carlota: Europe’s Last Empire in Mexico. Predictably, the French influence was also greatly felt in 19th century Mexican pastry, from orejas (a take on the French palmiers) to cuernitos (a take on croissants).

The first recorded doll cake draws inspiration from the poem “A Corpse Going to a Ball,” originally published by American author Seba Smith in 1843, about a girl named Charlotte who braves a frigid snowy night in an attempt to travel to a ball by sleigh, only to (spoiler) freeze to death. When mid-19th-century Germany started producing miniature porcelain dolls, they morbidly took to calling them “Frozen Charlotte” in reference to the popular poem. Poor Charlotte was carried around as a good-luck totem, and German bakers angling to profit on the trend began baking them into cakes––similar to the three kings bread, rosca de reyes, and Mardi Gras king cake, which both hide a baby doll figure somewhere within.

When Charles Dickens’s novel Barnaby Rudge was released in 1841, doll manufacturers began creating figures of the main character’s love interest, Dolly Varden, and the cake craze shortly followed. Dolly was a proper Victorian woman wearing a wide-brimmed hat and many layers of colorful skirts pinned up in a bustle, prompting fashion trends and even cake trends. While bakers didn’t recreate her exact likeness, the rise of “Dolly Varden Cakes” saw a surge in multicolored, multiflavored layer cakes that were often held together with jam. Around 1940, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother started a wedding cake topper trend in England of using bride and groom figurines that shared the likeness of the pair to be married. The cake style became an instant hit.

While the exact origins of the Barbie cake can’t be pinpointed, the first Barbie doll was released by Mattel in 1959. An immediate sensation, it likely boosted the already existing genre of doll cakes. By the 1970s, the cake decoration brand Wilton made crafting what became known as the Barbie cake, the fairytale cake, or the doll cake much easier. Wilton began selling a dome-shaped cake pan with a thin cylinder in the center called the Wonder Mold cake pan. This shape made inserting a doll pick––a pointy plastic pick that sticks out from the torso of the doll to stabilize it in the sweet bread––simpler. The cake pan also allowed bakers to achieve the dome shape of a skirt in one bake instead of having to cut and shape cake layers. Finally, in the 1980s, the first official recipe for a doll cake, known locally as a Dolly Varden cake, was featured in The Australian Women’s Weekly Children’s Birthday Cake Book. The painstakingly piped cake skirt, of course, likely takes inspiration from the ornate, voluminously ruffled and draped crinoline Victorian skirt styles built up by boning and a bustle in the 1850s.

How exactly is a Barbie cake created today? Do pairs of legs lurk beneath buttercream, or do bakeries have a designated bucket with glossy, tippy-toed doll limbs sticking out, toe side up? Jannette Pastrana, the Puerto Rican baker behind cottage bakery Jannette’s Cakes in Willimantic, Connecticut––currently only open to lucky friends and family of Pastrana in Bridgeport, CT, and now operating as Jannette La Piraguera, selling Puerto Rican shaved ice in the summertime––laughs at my bucket theory, and promptly corrects me. She’s been making doll cakes for quinceañera centerpieces since the height of their popularity in the ’80s and ’90s.

“Usually the dolls don’t have legs,” she says. Pastrana explains that the dolls used for cakes typically end at the waist, with a pick that’s used to stabilize them into the sponge of the cake, aptly dubbed a doll pick. Wilton still sells doll picks, as do a host of other companies, though folks can also scour eBay for vintage pieces. However, because of the lack of diversity available among Wilton doll picks in the late 20th century, Pastrana’s clients customarily provided their own Barbie doll, legs and all, to visually represent the girl whose birthday was being celebrated. This required some surgical adjustment, whether to the doll or to the shape of the cake. Inserting an entire Barbie could destabilize the cake, so Pastrana typically removed the legs first. She started rethinking her method after a young girl, who was reportedly horrified at the sight of a legless Barbie after cutting into her cake, returned to Pastrana requesting that her next doll cake please have legs.

While this cake form has been widely embraced by coming-of-age Latinas for their quinceañera celebrations and other birthdays, it’s clearly a nostalgic cake for many around the globe. Abena Anim-Somuah, the voice behind the Cherry Bombe podcast The Future Of Food Is You and the author of the Your Friend in Food newsletter, celebrated her first birthday in 1997 with a doll cake in Ghana. “My mom is just someone who is really into birthdays and celebration,” Anim-Somuah told me over text. “It was my first birthday cake I ever had, and I think it was a big deal for my mom having her first child, her first daughter.” Anim-Somuah’s mom had noticed her love of Barbies and commissioned her friend to bake her a white buttercream doll cake with pink trim.

In Singapore, food writer and vegan baker Gan Chin Lin says doll cakes were a “staple” locally in the late 2000s and early 2010s. “I feel like they were part of a larger, now antiquated character cake vogue,” Lin shared through DM. She says the “waist-down” cake design, which featured a skirt or sometimes even a mermaid tail and often portrayed Disney or Disney-adjacent princesses, was popular at her female friends’ birthday parties. It always surprised her, however, that the Barbie was naked underneath the sponge and buttercream.

These famous doll cakes have retained relevance through the decades, as evidenced by this Reddit thread from last year titled “Who remembers the grocery store barbie doll cakes???” They are still available for purchase through cottage, local, and chain bakeries like Publix (starting at $79.99 for a blonde Barbie with a pink frosting skirt). Online, whether through TikTok, YouTube, or Instagram, doll cakes continue to hold intrigue and excitement for bakers and viewers alike who showcase the creation process from beginning to end. From ultra-vintage-style Barbie cakes like Hannah Currie’s (@laretrorecipe) classic using a chic ’50s doll, to more modern doll cakes like those made by Mirvat Hachem-Osseili (@bakemydaymimo on TikTok) –– who focuses on Barbie dolls that reflect the beauty of little girls everywhere, like in this hijabi Barbie cake — the craft is alive and well.

As much as they still hold a special place in celebration and pastry, however, these cakes are simply not as popular as they once were. Even Wilton has taken notice. “Though doll cakes aren’t as popular as they used to be, we still see people have great heart for these kind of cakes, especially for birthday parties. Most often they are made into doll skirts decorated with buttercream or fondant,” the company’s representative, Kristen Agnello-Dean, wrote in an email.

This holds especially true for modern girls celebrating quinceañeras, who Pastrana says now ask for more sophisticated cake styles, like three-tier cakes with fondant. Irma Garcia, a custom cake baker located in Chula Vista, California, says she doesn’t get requests for doll-style cakes. Lately there’s been a spike in orders for tiered cakes, starting at three tiers and up, often reflecting the quince’s theme or just in an elegant and floral-decorated style.

Pastrana may have noticed the decline in Barbie cakes back in 2005, but she still has one devoted doll cake customer. “I’ve been baking her doll cakes every year for her birthday ever since her first,” she told me over the phone. That customer turns 21 this year, and she had planned a four-foot-tall cake with 20 miniature dolls from cakes past, some of which have been saved and some of which she would repurchase, all propped on one tall cake as the centerpiece. This pièce de résistance has been postponed, however, as the soon-to-be 21-year-old is going on a cruise for her upcoming birthday.

As for Pastrana, her love and nostalgia for the Barbie cake persists. Who knows? Maybe there is an order for a custom Barbie wedding cake in her future.

In the first blush of their relationship, The Washington Post and Jeff Bezos seemed like an excellent match. Here was a paper with a strong pedigree that had fallen on somewhat hard times, and a suitor with funds who seemed eager to return it to steady glory. In 2013 Bezos purchased the paper for $250 million from the Graham family and promised a “golden era” to come. I had left the Post by then but was happy for my former colleagues. When Donald Trump took office a few years later, it was a relief to know that a journalistic institution with a record of holding White House misdeeds to account was still close by.

Yesterday, in a dismal morning Zoom call, the Post’s executive editor, Matt Murray, announced that they were laying off one-third of its already diminished staff. The follow-up email had the tone of robotic obfuscation that any decent editor would have rewritten. (“Following up on today’s communication, I’m writing to share the difficult news that your position is eliminated as part of today’s organizational changes.”) It’s of course painful, as a journalist, to see fellow journalists get laid off. It’s painful, for anyone alert to the moment, to know that one of the last remaining expert watchdogs is hobbled. It’s maybe most painful to know it could have been avoided.

In this episode of Radio Atlantic, I spoke with Joshua Benton, the founder of and a senior writer at the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. Benton has closely watched the media business for years. He explains how the newspaper reached this point, the loss to journalism, and how the future of the Post is ultimately up to Bezos.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: Seven years ago, around this time, The Washington Post ran an ad in the Super Bowl: “Democracy dies in darkness.” It showed scenes of fires, explosions, floods, tanks—and journalists who’ve risked their lives for their profession.

All with swelling music and a voice-over by Tom Hanks.

Rosin: But then just before the Super Bowl this year, the Post took a different turn. And it was not another Super Bowl ad.

Rosin: On Wednesday, Post staffers joined a Zoom call first thing in the morning. Executive editor Matt Murray spoke first.

Rosin: The paper would be making massive cuts: closing the Sports department …

Rosin: Downsizing their Metro desk and International desk.

Rosin: One of their reporters based in Ukraine posted to X: “I was just laid off by The Washington Post in the middle of a warzone.”

Rosin: The entire Books department at the Post was cut.

Rosin: A suspension of their daily news show.

Rosin: Every single department would be impacted.

Rosin: In less than 30 minutes, a historic journalistic institution cut its staff by almost a third, after two previous rounds of punishing layoffs.

This was the home of the Watergate investigation.

Rosin: Publisher of the Pentagon Papers.

Rosin: Winner of dozens and dozens of Pulitzer Prizes.

Rosin: Just to break that down: a paper in the backyard of the White House and Congress that has, many times, uncovered people in power lying or grifting, or failing to do their jobs in ways that affect every single American, whether or not they live in D.C.

Not to mention all the work their reporters have done in Ukraine, and China, and the Middle East and anywhere else in the world where crisis might be brewing

I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic.

There are only a handful of mainstream national journalistic institutions left with this kind of robust infrastructure—experienced editors and reporters, photographers, foreign correspondents—who can expertly monitor people in power. Particularly at this moment in American history, when those people seem to be grifting and lying in new and elaborate ways.

Whose fault is this? Why does it matter? We talk to Joshua Benton. He’s a longtime newspaper reporter and the founder of a senior writer at the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University, where he writes about the media business.

Josh, welcome to the show.

Joshua Benton: Thanks for having me.

Rosin: So you cover the media business; you have for a long time. You are not new to this kind of industry news. What was your reaction to the layoffs at the Post?

Benton: Well, there have been a lot of systemic difficulties in the newspaper business as long as I’ve been reporting on it. There is a large secular decline that has been brought about by the internet that has continued on without too much change. But I think the story of the Post is a very unique-to-the-Post story. It’s fundamentally about one man, Jeff Bezos, and his changing vision of what the role of the owner of a major American newspaper should be.

Rosin: So you said two different things: It’s Post-specific and it’s also related to this giant in our culture, Jeff Bezos. I mean, I know why the news resonated with me—because I’m a journalist. I live in Washington. I worked at the Post. I have many friends there.

But I can imagine people who are not in any of those categories reading this news and thinking: Layoffs happen all the time, especially newspaper layoffs. This paper still exists, even though with less staff.

So why should they care? Why is it significant for people who don’t live in Washington, aren’t journalists?

Benton: Well, for one thing, The Washington Post has always been a paper whose editorial importance was not limited to the city or to the district. It’s a national outlet. It’s one of the two largest national newspaper outlets.

It covers the happenings in Washington, D.C. Certainly there’s lots of stories to cover there. So to the extent that we have any decrease in the number of people who are paying attention to what’s going on, I think that’s a loss.

It’s also a retrenchment from what Jeff Bezos first seemed to pledge when he first purchased the paper, in 2013, which was that he would not be looking to the newspaper as a source of money. He has enough money from lots of other sources. He did seem to take seriously the idea that he was a steward of an institution, the way that the Graham family that he purchased it from had always viewed the role of being in charge of this institution that mattered to the city and to the country.

And it’s certainly true that The Washington Post has lost money and is, has declined in a number of ways financially. It’s also up to Jeff Bezos whether or not he is going to support a newspaper that is going to be robust journalistically and ambitious digitally, or whether or not he has grown tired of it and decided to step back his investment in the property.

And I think what’s troubling in this particular change is, you’re seeing what had been an institution that had really benefited from his ownership for a good long time that seems to have gone into reverse in a way that particularly aligns with the way that the political winds in Washington have blown for the last few years.

Rosin: So it sounds like what you’re saying is the reason this is significant for everybody is because how Bezos changed his mind and changed his attitude towards the paper. So can you say a little more about that? What about his change of heart is important or strikes you as important?

Benton: We saw a confluence of events in the fall of 2024 around President Trump’s second election that I think were very telling. You had, in October, Bezos making a decision on behalf of the newspaper to stop endorsing candidates for president at a time that the newspaper would have certainly been expected to—and the editorial board of the newspaper had desired to—endorse Kamala Harris. Bezos put out a statement saying that actually it’s an awful idea for a newspaper to endorse a presidential candidate, because it creates the perception of bias. And we need to have a newspaper that doesn’t sully itself with a presidential endorsement.

Almost immediately that led to a huge negative impact to the paper’s bottom line because more than 250,000 existing subscribers canceled their subscriptions, and that’s the lifeblood of a modern-day media company. Not long after that, he announced that he was going to be shifting the way that the opinion pages of the paper functioned. He would potentially be eliminating most of the left-of-center perspectives in exchange for a focus on what he called “personal liberties and free markets.” He said explicitly, We will cover other issues besides personal liberties and free markets, but we will not be running any opinions that are in opposition to those.

He never really explained which personal liberties he was especially interested in, but it became pretty clear in the coming months that he was trying to shift the Post’s editorial page and opinion section more to the right, more aligned with the new Trump administration. And in the middle of that, you had the instance of Jeff Bezos appearing at Trump’s inauguration. You had the much-discussed, recently, purchase of the Melania Trump documentary at far-above market rates in a way that has been perceived by some to be something of a bribe.

You saw in this very short period of time a shift from the Post being an establishment—an institution—that was a potentially a powerful source of constraint on any presidential administration, but in particular this one, to the Post being perceived to be traveling along with the political winds.

Rosin: So it sounds like your analysis is very Bezos focused, because you could parse the blame for what happened on a few different places. It could be ownership—Jeff Bezos, management, just the state of the industry, the product itself. But you are focused on Bezos.

Benton: One thing that Jeff Bezos knows probably better than anyone else is that digital industries tend to focus around one big winner. I mean, Amazon.com is the perfect example of this. You went from a universe of having lots of diverse small retailers in the physical world, in malls and on main streets, to having one giant that dominates the online-retail business and doesn’t allow much else to thrive outside of it in a lot of cases. That same phenomenon happens in the digital news business. It’s just that, in digital news, The New York Times is Amazon.com. They are the giant that has been able to become overwhelmingly central to the way that the digital-newspaper business works. So in that context, the self-inflicted wounds that I would argue Bezos has caused the Post to suffer were particularly damaging because it was not competing from a position of strength. It was starting off from a position of relative market weakness.

Rosin: So initially we were talking about ideological factors, like a desire to curry favor with Trump, or at least not to irritate Trump. It sounds like now you’re talking about more, sort of, financial reasons. I mean, that suggests that, what, he’s a bad businessman?

Like, we don’t think of Jeff Bezos as a bad businessman. What does that suggest?

Benton: Jeff Bezos has not historically been very involved in the management of The Washington Post. He took a very hands-off approach to management. He was not, you know, meddling in editorial decisions. He was, in a lot of ways, for the first decade or so, a pretty ideal hands-off owner for the Post who put investment into the paper, who allowed its newsroom to grow, allowed, you know, a digital-subscription strategy to thrive.

But I don’t think at any point it has been a central part of where his business instincts have been focused. I wouldn’t view his ownership of The Washington Post as primarily a business transaction.

I think you could look at the first portion of his ownership as something approaching a philanthropic goal. And I think you can look at the last couple of years primarily as trying to meet a political goal.

One of the side effects of the changes that he made in 2024 or 2025 is that it drove away an enormous number of talented journalists, including to places like The Atlantic. One reason that the Post has struggled editorially over the past year is that they lost a lot of their best reporters, their highest-profile reporters who were the best source in the White House, in Congress, in places where, you know, the stories that a newspaper can break that gets you attention, that proves to your subscribers the value of the subscription they’re paying for.

The people who produce those stories often weren’t working there anymore. And the stories that they would have been writing, breaking, that would’ve been proving the value of a digital subscription to the Post—they just weren’t getting reported.

Rosin: So this is what—when people say a “death spiral” for news outlets where you have a shrinking business, leads to a downsized product, which leads to more shrinking business. Is that where the Post is now?

Benton: The biggest shift in the financial model of newspapers that has occurred in the transition from print to digital is a decreasing reliance on advertising and an increasing reliance on direct payments from subscribers. When newspapers had something closer to a monopoly on the distribution of information every day, they were able to charge very high advertising rates and they had mass audiences.

And it was a business that worked extremely well for them for a long time. Under the print model, an American newspaper usually made about 80 percent of its money from advertising and only about 20 percent from readers buying the paper or subscribing to the newspaper. In the shift to digital, the advertising money has largely gone away, to companies like Google and Facebook, and newspapers are increasingly reliant on subscriber revenue, especially, now, digital-subscriber revenue since that’s where the audiences are.

And to succeed in a digital-subscription world, you need to convince people why they should still pay for you every month when they’re also paying for Netflix and they’re also paying for Amazon Prime and they’re also paying for the long list of subscriptions that litter, you know, the credit-card bills of probably everyone listening to this.

That is a competitive marketplace where news organizations have a real editorial burden to prove their merits over and over again, and that means that a relatively small decision, like we’re not going to endorse someone for president can have a really outsized impact because it creates, for a quarter-million people, a reason to suddenly say, You know what? It’s not worth the 10 bucks a month, the 15 bucks a month that I’m paying if they’re gonna be doing something that I find so much in opposition to my point of view.

Rosin: After the break: Should people have really expected anything better from Bezos? And should all those people really have canceled their subscriptions? That’s in a minute.

[Break]

Rosin: In retrospect, now that I hear you talk and see how important that moment was when hundreds of thousands of people canceled their subscription, it was an act of protest, but now I feel like, were they protesting against the right thing and for the right place? It’s like shooting yourself in your, you know, civic-participation foot. It just doesn’t seem like they were aiming at the right target there.

Benton: Yeah, you saw at the time, when people were canceling their subscriptions, you would see on social media reporters from the Post saying: please don’t cancel the Post. We understand that you may, may not like the decision that was made by our owner, but it’s your money that allows us to keep operating, to allow us to still have jobs.

So there is a real tension there. But at the same time, for me, it’s very difficult to describe what happened at the Post as primarily a market-driven phenomenon.

The amount of money that the Post is losing is enormous to you or to me. To Jeff Bezos, it is nothing. His net worth in the past year has gone up enough to continue to pay for all the money that The Washington Post is losing for the rest of his life and the rest of his children’s lives and the rest of his grandchildren’s lives.

His wealth is at such a scale that there is no reason that a set of cuts like the one that we’ve seen this week is an economic necessity. It’s a choice.

There are enormous negative financial things happening in the digital-news business more broadly, but I think that is distinct from what is happening to The Washington Post, because that is one man’s choice fundamentally.

Rosin: And do you think that’s a reasonable expectation you’re making of Jeff Bezos? Like, he’s a businessman, and so: Why should we expect him to behave differently than the many negligent owners of many newspapers who I’m sure you’ve tracked over the last decade-plus?

Benton: You know, that’s a very reasonable question. I’d say the reason I would expect different is because he acted differently. The Washington Post was never a source of profit for him in any significant way.

When Bezos first bought the Post, in 2013, one way I’d thought about it was: There aren’t many things that a man that wealthy and that powerful can do to change something in the first few paragraphs of his obituary. When Jeff Bezos dies he will be described as the founder of Amazon.com, who, you know, created one of the great fortunes of all time.

You know, if he takes mankind to another planet, perhaps that would show up there as well. (Laughs.)

If he had saved one of the most important journalistic institutions in America, that would be another thing that would show up in those first few paragraphs, perhaps. There are reasons for someone with that much wealth to invest in something that they think is good for society, good for civilization, good for the country.

And the way he spoke when he purchased the Post was filled with language of, I’m giving you runway. I’m not a shareholder you have to pay in the same way that a publicly held or hedge-fund-purchased newspaper company would have to.

And it was the fact that that was his stance for so long, for a decade, that makes this transition, I think, somewhat jarring to people within the Post and people who read the Post.

Rosin: So it seems like the Post was struggling when Bezos bought it, and the layoffs seem to indicate it’s struggling now. But it did seem to be doing well at one point in his tenure. What made that possible, and what changed?

Benton: So our insight into the financial condition of the Bezos-era Post is really limited, because, as a privately held company, they don’t have to report any numbers to shareholders or regulators. It certainly was true, though, that they benefited starting around 2017 with the “Trump bump” that helped a lot of news organizations.

Once Trump was elected in this very unusual new federal government came into place, there was a huge increase in interest in national news that sort of raised all boats, and the Post certainly benefited from that because they were, along with the Times, one of the premier operations that was covering what was happening in Washington during this very unusual time.

So they had a huge increase in the number of subscribers that they had. They reached a peak, they reported, of around 3 million digital subscribers, which was the third-highest in the country behind the Times and also The Wall Street Journal. They were breaking stories left and right. When Bezos first appeared, he was willing to invest into increasing a lot of positions within the newsroom, adding a lot of people on the product side and on the digital side of the operation. It was a good time to be at the Post.

They also happened to have a very good editor at the time, Marty Baron, and they were blessed with the first Trump administration as a story to cover. There certainly is a universe in which you could have imagined a second Trump administration providing that same sort of bump or at least a smaller version of it to the Post.

But this is, one of the other unfortunate things about the timing is that at the exact moment that this second Trump administration was beginning was right when Jeff Bezos had shot themselves in the foot by not endorsing the presidential election and causing these 250,000 subscribers to cancel and making this pivot into having the Opinion section only be about “free markets” and the promotion of what he considers to be “personal liberties.”

I think there really was an opportunity for the Post to have another good stretch, editorially and financially. And I think you can point to some decisions that Bezos made as reasons why that didn’t happen.

Rosin: I mean, one question is, do you get the sense that the tech crowd thinks that journalism done by humans just doesn’t matter that much? Like, it’s the opposite of our future.

Benton: I’ve seen dozens and dozens of tech companies and start-ups and AI companies who tend to view news as a world of inefficiencies that are waiting to be quote-unquote “fixed.”

They look at a newsroom, which hires expensive people to do a lot of manual gathering of information and manual writing-up of that information or production of podcasts or videos about that information. They see a process that they think can be rendered more efficient and can have a lot of the cost structure ripped out of it.

I’m open to technological changes that could push in that direction. If they find wonderful ways to create that universe, you know, I’d love to hear about it. At the same time, I think, at a time that we as a society are increasingly concerned about the role of a few large technology companies and AI algorithms that we don’t have a lot of insight into, the amount of control that those institutions seem to have on very fundamental elements of the way information gets distributed, the way that the economy works—I think there’s a real disconnect in values there that I think would be pretty difficult for anyone to navigate.

Rosin: Let me just try this on you. Like, is there some alternate way that you can imagine holding government accountable? I guess I’m asking: Is journalism irrelevant? Like, is there any other way to create an informed citizenry?

Are we clinging to something that just, you know, isn’t gonna last?

Benton: Gosh, that’s dark. (Laughs.)

Rosin: I know it’s a terrible question. I’m just trying to elicit the best argument for why anyone should care about what you even are describing as this thing that has totally different values than this other thing. And I understand this other thing to have most of the money and you know, to have, for a long time, kind of shaped our culture.

Benton: But at the same time, if you look at a place like Minneapolis and you look at the power that video images of things happening in the streets, to someone like Renee Good: The impact that the right information can have on a political body; on a citizenry; on a populace; on a protest movement; eventually, on a government—that power, in my mind, hasn’t been diminished.

It used to be that it was much more the realm of individual reporters and individual newspapers and television networks to dig up this information and to share this information. Now there are many more potential inputs into that system, right?

But that doesn’t, to my mind, reduce the power that information—accurate, timely information about the world around us—can have in how society and government work. I think that we had a sort of unusual glory period for a number of decades across the 20th century where the things that were healthy for our democracy were also things that aligned really well with an advertising-driven business model.

It didn’t make a lot of sense at an intellectual level that the same people who would be reporting on what’s happening in Baghdad or what’s happening on some distant battlefield would be putting their work right next to furniture-store ads and classified ads for jobs and all the other things that created this unusual mixture of elements that was 20th-century mass media.

We were kind of lucky that those happened to align for a while. And they very much do not align anymore. I think the shift away from relying on advertising and relying on subscribers and people willing to invest, essentially, in what they see as being useful for democracy is a potential route to stability, in that—you know, The New York Times has been able to navigate that extremely well. They’re a much bigger business than they’ve ever been before and still doing lots of excellent journalism, though I’m sure everyone can critique any number of pieces of it.

I still think that there is an enormous amount of value in the work that journalists do, and there are models out there. And one of those models that a lot of people, for a while, had some hope in was philanthropically minded billionaires who would see the value in what journalism was doing, and also have the capacity to remove it from the marketplace of capitalism, at least to a degree.

And I think Jeff Bezos did that for a while, to a certain degree. So I think that’s why it’s extra-frustrating to see him instead shoving The Washington Post right back into that marketplace and saying, Oh no, now I have to make the same sort of decisions that someone who, you know, a struggling businessman who is worried about paying his mortgage might have to make—to make the difficult cuts.

That’s what makes it difficult—that this is very much a choice. This is a choice that one man made that is going to harm a lot of journalists and is going to harm a lot of people who would have benefited from the journalism.

Rosin: Okay, so: Is there a path forward for The Washington Post?

Benton: That’s entirely up to Jeff Bezos. He could decide to convert The Washington Post into a nonprofit. He could decide to keep shrinking and keep cutting. He could decide to invest again in anything that he’s decided not to invest in. It’s a property that he has total and complete control over. I think there is a path forward for good journalism.

The Post benefits from its incredible history and the relationships it has built up over the decades in Washington and beyond. But it’s also hamstrung by that history and by the fact that it is built out as a print business that has shifted towards digital as opposed to being a digital-first business, right. There are paths forward, and it’s really up to one man to decide if he chooses to take any of them.

Rosin: Well, Josh, thank you so much for joining me today.

Benton: Absolutely. My pleasure.

        <hr/>
        NEW YORK — “I don’t think that bitch looks fit,” a woman next to me murmurs. She’s carrying a Louis Vuitton bag, wearing Hermes riding boots, and speaking, of course, about one of the three female Cane Corsos still in the ring.

It’s not exactly an unwarranted thing for her to say; she does have a dog in this fight. Two, to be precise. The two fitter bitches both belong to her. With the way the judge has physically sorted the field, it’s clear that a male is about to be picked Best of Breed, and that means the likelihood of one of her dogs winning Best of Opposite (the award given to the best dog of the opposite sex) is pretty high.

Like many of the women around me, the Cane Corso owner is wearing a tweed suit. As I’ve learned from many handlers over the course of two days, those suits speak to the prestige, perfectionism, and traditionalism of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. It matters if the bitch is fit because that’s the name of the game. Sure, many of these dogs are born perfect; high-level breeders can often tell from puppyhood if a dog has potential to become show ready. They have to be champions just to get to Westminster. But in order to stand out here, at the “Super Bowl of Dog Shows,” the dogs need every edge they can get: a freshly cleaned coat that is maintained every few minutes, flawless posture, and, yes, a handler that has strategized their outfit around the canine they’ll be presenting.

At any given moment, hundreds of dogs are being prepped in the backstage benching area. The grooming never stops. Between barks and the occasional howl, there are suits being steamed, fur being straightened, black noses being buffed. This is the pinnacle of human obsession with the pursuit of aesthetics, channeled through man’s best friend. Dog shows are simultaneously about individuality and conformity. Breeds are trying to meet written aesthetic standards, but they are also trying to be singular. In many ways, the humans are no different. As one exhibitor tells me, “It’s the Dance Moms of dog shows.”

At Westminster, you’ll find hundreds of dog handlers who worship at the altar of St. John. “St. John” doesn’t refer to St. John’s men’s basketball, or noted local Episcopal cathedral St. John the Divine, or Saint John the Apostle himself. Instead, their devotion is to the American luxury knitwear brand St. John, founded in 1962 and known for its Chanel-like knit suits and skirts. The 19-year-old handler with the longhaired dachshund is wearing a cream-colored St. John suit. That Pomeranian owner’s sparkly red two-piece? St. John. The rhinestone-encrusted skirt? St. John. I stop to ask two women in the benches where their monochrome suits are from. They say in unison, “St. John.”

“I had an unfortunate experience [with a St. John suit] at Westminster a few years ago,” says Charlotte Wagner, who is showing her American Staffordshire Terrier. Wagner is the first woman I’ve spoken to who is wearing something other than St. John. “It was my first year attending as an exhibitor, not a spectator. And I ordered a beautifully made St. John dress. … It arrived the day before Westminster, and it was way too big. So I never understood the trend, because it’s not for my shape.”

This is Wagner's first year at Westminster as a U.S. citizen, although she’s lived here for 38 years. Her outfit—from Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, and other American designers—is a tribute to the dog, who is American and named “Ralph” for Ralph Lauren (although his registered name is “Carmichael Dressed to Impress”). Below us, Ralph pants. Most of the time, he’s an Appalachian farm dog, but this week he’s a star.

“You’ll need to clean your lens,” Wagner warns me. “Ralph just licked your camera.”

As for the men, the options for creativity are limited only by your imagination—as long as it’s within the confines of a suit. Andrew Webber, who got his first show dog two years ago, has a light brown German Pinscher named Gravy. “As much as your dog looks nice, you want to look nice as well,” Webber tells me. To pair with Gravy, he wears a lot of blue and greens, and mixes patterns to add a little fun.

I ask another handler, Ashley Wilkerson, where her suit is from. “I’m wearing a St. John suit, lots of glitter, lots of sparkle. My dog is black, so I want him to stand out as much as I do, and have a contrast,” Wilkerson says. As for the St. John suits, she tells me that they’re comfortable, professional-looking, and a status symbol.

There’s a St. John booth in the vendors section at Westminster. A glance at the tags will give you sticker shock—even on sale, these suits are well over a thousand dollars. It’s the first time St. John has had a booth at Westminster, the attendants tell me, a response to the immense popularity of the brand among dog handlers. They’ve been getting a lot of purchasers whose dogs won Best in Breed. Since their dogs have advanced to the next round of competition at Madison Square Garden, they’re looking to debut a new suit.

But for the most part, the suits at Westminster are secondhand. Multiple women tell me that they bought their suits off their friends, or somebody they met at a dog show. Many are wearing suits from the 1970s. The Facebook group “St John Dog Show Outfits” has over 13,000 members, and the secondhand suit sets are typically priced at a few hundred dollars.

“This originally was probably a suit I couldn’t afford, and I bought this suit for $90,” Teena Uyeno, dog owner and handler, tells me. She’s sitting with her friend, Ava Hata, who’s also an owner and handler. Asked why the St. John suits are so great, Uyeno tells me that they’re fairly stretchy, and mobility is extremely important when you’re running and moving with a dog.

I soon learn how important it is to dress for movement and comfort. In the Samoyed ring, a handler wipes out when their dog starts running too fast. The heels she’s wearing were a last-minute decision, and she couldn’t move well enough with them.

Two hours after I take a poodle’s picture in the benching area, I circle back to find the same woman still fussing with its fur. Thus is the life of a longhaired show dog—endless primping, and a little less petting. Uyeno tells me some show dog owners will pay something like $5,000 a month just for hair maintenance on their dogs. “It’s crazy,” she says.

Out in the rings, I see two convention-goers petting a fluffy Alaskan Malamute. The handler tenses. “Please don’t touch, because once you start petting him, he likes to go on his back, and I just worked up all that volume.”

There are steel dog combs everywhere, occasionally tucked in the updos of handlers, other times held between human teeth when hands are occupied with leashes. Every few seconds, someone is stopping to brush out their dog again. Sometimes, they’ll mist them with antistatic spray.

The shorthaired dogs can’t get away with relaxing either. Handlers rush around to take their dogs for practice laps—they’ll be evaluated on how “nicely” they move, so they need to be limbered up. Outside the ring where boxers are being judged, I hear some remark on the musculature of one of the dogs. As we’ve established, it’s important to be fit.

Back in the benches, I see a spaniel being blown dry with a Dyson Supersonic. Around the corner, a precious West Highland White Terrier is being bathed in a tub of white powder to enhance its brightness. A woman is spritzing her Maltese with (human) salon-grade leave-in product. I’m starting to think these dogs have better hair than I could ever hope for. There’s bottles and bottles of Tresemmé extra hold hair spray wherever I look. What is that man doing to that big old Tibetan Mastiff? “Red light therapy,” the man tells me.

The ultimate bookstore bucket list for bibliophiles.

Book lovers travel for authors, for ideas, for history, but also for rooms. A great bookstore can be a kind of gentle escapism made architectural. Around the world, a handful of them have earned reputations not as retail stops but as cherished landmarks. Churches stripped of pews, former theaters, banks, warehouses, and improbably modern structures. They are places where people linger without buying, buy without needing, and leave feeling altered in some way. Here are 10 beautiful locations to add to your little black book of bookstores.

1 OF 10

El Ateneo Grand Splendid

WHERE: Buenos Aires, Argentina

With more bookstores per capita than almost anywhere in the world, Buenos Aires is a literary powerhouse with picturesque book nooks like Eterna Cadencia and Librería de Ávila, the oldest in the Argentine capital. However, nowhere is more reverence shown for the written word with greater drama than at El Ateneo Grand Splendid, the city’s most famous literary landmark. It occupies a former theater on Avenida Santa Fe that first opened in 1919. The frescoed ceiling still arches overhead, and original balconies curve around the space, though they now carry shelves instead of spectators. A deep red curtain continues to frame the former stage, where a café now stands. Be sure to head to the upper balconies for the best view of the space where daring performances once unfolded.

2 OF 10

Livraria Lello

WHERE: Porto, Portugal

There are few bookstores in the world that require advance planning, timed entry, and a tolerance for crowds before you’ve even seen a single spine. Opened in 1906 in Porto, Livraria Lello is one of Portugal’s oldest bookstores, and it is regularly cited as one of the most beautiful in the world. Housed in a neo-Gothic, Art Nouveau building, it is a dazzler of an edifice with carved wood, intricate plasterwork, and a luminous stained-glass ceiling that glows overhead like a secular chapel. The bookstore’s modern fame is largely due to persistent rumors that it inspired Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling. Visiting Livraria Lello is rewarding for the aesthetics, but a place for leisurely browsing, this is not. Expect crowds and queues, and be sure to get your ticket well in advance. The price goes towards any books bought in-store.

3 OF 10

Cărturești Carusel

WHERE: Bucharest, Romania

Opened in 2015 in Bucharest’s Lipscani district, Cărturești Carusel occupies a building with a past as layered as its shelves. Built in 1903 for the influential Chrissoveloni banking family, it was later nationalized under the Communist regime and eventually abandoned as communism collapsed. After three decades of legal battles, the original owner’s grandson finally reclaimed the decaying structure in 2007. What followed was an ambitious restoration involving more than 20,000 hours of labor, transforming it into what is now known as the “Carousel of Light.” Designed to be both a bookstore and a gathering place, it is popular, photogenic, and often busy with book lovers milling about the four luminous white floors curved around a central atrium.

4 OF 10

Libreria Acqua Alta

WHERE: Venice, Italy

When Venetian bookseller Luigi Frizzo leased his current space in 2002, he was warned that the property lay in a flood-prone zone near Piazza San Marco. Rather than retreat, he leaned in, naming the shop after the seasonal high tide that regularly seeps into Venice’s lowest quarters. Libreria Acqua Alta offers an eclectic mix of Venetian history, art books, novels, comics, and rare secondhand editions. To protect hundreds of thousands of volumes, including rare and out-of-print works, Frizzo devised an improvised flood-defense system: books stored in bathtubs, waterproof bins, and even full-sized gondolas. The now-famous staircase built from books began as a pragmatic solution for storage. Today, it doubles as one of Venice’s most photographed vantage points.

5 OF 10

Boekhandel Dominicanen

WHERE: Maastricht, Netherlands

Formerly known as Selexyz Dominicanen, Boekhandel Dominicanen occupies a 13th-century Gothic church whose religious function ended more than two centuries ago. Since then, the building has lived several lives, serving variously as a bicycle shed, a storage space, and even a carnival venue, before reopening in 2006 as a bookstore. The transformation was led by Dutch architects Merkx + Girod, who preserved the integrity of the church’s soaring vaults and frescoed ceilings by inserting a two-story black steel bookcase along one side of the nave. Books now rise where hymns once did, and there’s a wide selection of Dutch and English-language new and second-hand titles. The store is centrally located in Maastricht’s Binnenstad and open daily.

6 OF 10

Shakespeare and Company

WHERE: Paris, France

Directly opposite Notre-Dame at 37 rue de la Bûcherie, stands Shakespeare and Company, a bookstore in a 17th-century former monastery. American expat George Whitman opened it in 1951 as a place for Anglophone literary life in Paris to take root. Over the decades, it did exactly that, welcoming writers from Allen Ginsberg to James Baldwin and Julio Cortázar. Originally called Le Mistral, the shop was renamed Shakespeare and Company in 1964 to deliberately invoke the memory of the original Shakespeare and Company that was founded in 1919 by Sylvia Beach on rue de l’Odéon. The store hosts literary events and festivals, and uniquely, runs a Tumbleweeding program whereby writers can apply to live, write, and read on the premises for up to a month while assisting with events.

7 OF 10

Atlantis Books

WHERE: Santorini, Greece

For nearly two decades, Atlantis Books occupied a cave-like space in Oia, carved into the cliffside. It might have moved from its original perch, but it’s still a sight for sore eyes in Santorini’s northern village of Firostefani. Founded in 2004 by American philosophy student Craig Walzer and a small circle of friends, the bookstore began almost accidentally, sparked by a ferry ride from Piraeus, too much wine, and the realization that Santorini offered little in the literary department. Walk its white walls to uncover new and pre-loved books in English, Greek, Spanish, Italian, and more.

8 OF 10

Daikanyama T-Site

WHERE: Tokyo, Japan

Designed by Klein Dytham Architecture, the Daikanyama T-Site complex in Tokyo consists of three low-rise buildings arranged around a quiet garden. Its most striking feature is the latticed white façade, formed from hundreds of interlocking “T” shapes that subtly reference the logo of the Tsutaya books and media enterprise. Inside, the selection is vast, with books in multiple languages, niche titles, and an exceptional range of magazines, including rare international periodicals from the 1960s and 1970s. Music and film sit comfortably alongside literature, with CDs, vinyl, and even DVDs (remember those). With lounges, cafes, and even a convenience store, you are at liberty to enjoy the daily 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. opening hours without feeling hurried.

9 OF 10

Ler Devagar

WHERE: Lisbon, Portugal

Lisbon’s LX Factory, a former industrial zone wedged between the city center and Belém, has been reimagined as a cultural enclave of studios, cafés, and independent shops. Ler Devagar occupies a vast former printing warehouse there, with the machinery of mass production left intact. The bookstore was founded in 1999 in the Bairro Alto neighborhood and relocated to LX Factory in 2009. It functions simultaneously as a bookstore, café, exhibition space, and cultural venue, hosting debates, talks, and installations alongside its carefully curated collection. Ler Devagar means “read slowly,” and bookish folks have upwards of 40,000 titles to peruse. Books climb the walls across four levels, rising toward a ceiling some fourteen meters high. At the center of it all hangs the bookstore’s most iconic feature, an art installation of a white bicycle suspended improbably in midair.

10 OF 10

Foyles Charing Cross Road

WHERE: London, England

Foyles Charing Cross Road stands in the former home of prestigious London art and design college Central Saint Martins. This purpose-designed flagship was created in collaboration with architects Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands, and its specialist departments, housing more than 200,000 titles, are organized around a central, skylit atrium. You can take the stairs or use the lifts to traverse this concrete neighborhood of books loved by all ages. Children gather for weekly story times on Sundays, aspiring adventurers find travel books on level four, famished readers linger over coffee and pastries at the fifth-floor cafe, and authors regularly take the stage at the auditorium on the sixth floor. Foyles Charing Cross Road is a welcoming world of a place, grand without being intimidating.

        Tim Baucom has done this before. The Milan Cortina Games will be his third Olympics as a wax technician for the United States’ cross-country ski team, a job characterized by long flights schlepping tools and duffel bags of gear halfway around the world, and even longer days prepping skis. His objective is to help American athletes gain even a fraction of a second in competition. But for the first time at an Olympics, he won’t have what was once one of the most powerful tools in his kit: fluorinated ski waxes.

In sports where a gold medal can be decided by inches, downhill and cross-country skiers and snowboarders across the competitive spectrum have used so-called “fluoros” since the 1980s. Typically sold as powders or blocks of hard wax, these lubricants are renowned for their ability to wick water and shed grime, making it easier to glide through snow with minimal resistance, especially in warm conditions. “There’s nothing in the chemical world that I’m aware of that can replicate their hydrophobic and dirt-repelling properties,” Baucom said.

But the reason these products work so well is that they contain PFAS, short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. This class of 15,000 so-called “forever chemicals” is notorious for their harmful effects on human health and the natural world. After years of mounting concern over human exposure and environmental contamination, the International Ski and Snowboard Federation, known by its French acronym FIS, banned the use of fluoros in 2023. “I think it kind of is our duty as a winter sport to have some concern for the environment,” said Katherine Stewart-Jones, a cross-country skier who will represent Canada at the Games, which begin tomorrow.

While athletes have had two World Cup seasons to get used to the change, this marks the first Winter Games without the advantage conferred by these once-ubiquitous products. It will be the highest-stakes test yet for racers and wax technicians’ ability to work with products that are less effective and more sensitive to what’s happening on the trails and slopes.

“There are a lot more unknowns with the new waxes,” said Julia Kern, a U.S. cross-country skier who has won two World Championship medals and hopes to add Olympic hardware to her collection. “I definitely think it makes it more challenging.”

People have been lubricating skis for centuries. The History of Lapland, published in 1704, describes Sámi skiers using pine pitch or rosin to create a smooth, waterproof surface for their wooden skis. By the 1800s, athletes were experimenting with glycerin, whale oil, kerosene, and spermaceti, and the early 1900s brought water-repellent shellacs. In the 1940s, the Norwegian company Swix — a portmanteau of “ski” and “wax” — helped popularize petroleum-derived paraffin waxes.

PFAS proliferated after the 1938 invention of Teflon — the stuff used in nonstick pots and pans — and were added to everything from takeout containers and outdoor clothing to firefighting foam and upholstery. But it wasn’t until the 1980s that PFAS made their way to skiing and snowboarding. These chemicals promised greater speed with less fuss in changing conditions. California entrepreneur Terry Hertel was among the first to dabble with the stuff after buying a fluorocarbon sample from the chemical company 3M. After realizing they made skis “faster than anything before,” he began adding fluorocarbons to his company’s waxes. Companies like Toko and Swix quickly followed.

Nathan Schultz, a former U.S. cross-country racer who now owns a ski shop in Denver, remembers trying fluoro formulas for the first time in the mid-‘90s. “You put that stuff on your skis and it was like you were floating,” he said. Quantifying the exact advantage they conferred was difficult, since cross-country, downhill, and snowboard courses vary widely and race-day conditions differ from season to season. Still, he said, the effects were tangible, especially on wet snow. At first, fluoros were predominantly used by racers at important events because of their high cost. But by the time Schultz retired in 2006, everyone was using them.

“If you tried to do a race without fluorinated wax, you would not be competitive,” Schultz said. “The amount of speed you could buy on your skis was really ridiculous.”

There was only one problem: The world could no longer ignore the dangers of PFAS. The chemicals were turning up everywhere, contaminating soil, food, and drinking water. Studies increasingly linked exposure to thyroid disease, developmental problems, and cancer.

Baucom experienced that growing awareness himself, first as a collegiate racer and, starting in the late aughts, as a professional cross-country ski tech. Talk of the health risks was swirling through his sport’s often cramped and poorly ventilated wax rooms, where techs heated fluoro wax and ironed it into ski bases, kicking vapors and particulates into the air along the way. Wearing a mask or cracking a window provided only so much protection. “Any time you’re breathing in fumes and smoke, no matter what it is, it’s probably not great for you,” said Baucom, who was concerned about the growing body of research on the chemicals’ health risks. “It was pretty obvious right out the gate that these products have potential carcinogenic components.”

Evidence of the risk mounted throughout the 2010s. One particularly alarming study from 2010 found that PFAS accumulated in the bodies of Scandinavian wax technicians, whose blood levels of the compound PFOA averaged 25 times higher than those of the general population. A 2024 study later confirmed the concentrations in people like Baucom “are among the highest of any occupation investigated to date.”

“There was high exposure intensity, frequency, and duration,” said Kate Crawford, an author of the more recent research and an assistant professor of environmental studies at Middlebury College.

John Steel Hagenbuch, a Nordic, or cross-country, skier on the U.S. Ski Team, recently had his blood tested and discovered his PFAS levels are higher than average. “The main concern with [PFAS] is that they’re so persistent,” he said. “They can remain in your blood or in water for a really long time.”

PFAS’s durability means these chemicals don’t break down as they move from skis to snow and then into the soil and nearby watersheds. The full extent of contamination remains difficult to quantify, but growing evidence suggests it extends well beyond wax rooms.

In 2021, officials in Park City, Utah, detected the compounds in three wells drawing from an underground aquifer, including one near the start line of White Pine Touring Nordic Center race course. At first, water quality specialist Michelle De Haan suspected firefighting foam, but local agencies hadn’t used it. She later came across a study examining fluorinated race lubricants and, of the 14 related compounds identified in the study, 11 matched those found in the city’s aquifer. “That became a clearer picture to us,” De Haan said. While not definitive on its own, the finding suggested a likely link — one echoed by sampling in Europe that has found elevated PFAS levels on ski slopes there too.

The impact can be especially significant when ski racers bring PFAS to places that might not otherwise be contaminated. “In some instances, people would be [using fluorinated waxes] in relatively pristine areas,” said Crawford. “It becomes a relatively significant environmental problem.”

For years, these issues with ski wax lurked in plain sight. But as scientists learned more, the ski and snowboard community found itself caught between the knowledge that fluoros carried serious risks and the desire for easy speed.

By the late 2010s, the unease surrounding PFAS had begun to shape policy that impacted, or even targeted, ski waxes. Regulators in the U.S. and Europe restricted some of the most-studied PFAS, in part by requiring manufacturers to get formal approval before using them in new applications. A handful of smaller races implemented their own fluoro bans — “wax truces,” as Schultz described them — though it remained difficult to compete without them in events that didn’t participate.

Momentum grew in 2019, when the International Ski and Snowboard Federation, or FIS, announced plans for a blanket ban covering all 7,000 Nordic, Alpine, and snowboard competitions under its purview, including the World Cup. The decision elicited “surprise/shock,” said Lars Karlöf, the sanctioning body’s technical adviser, but it was intended to “limit the environmental impact of our activities as much as possible.”

That’s when Swix disposed of its stockpile of fluoro waxes, says Geoff Hurwitch, commercial director for Swix USA. While he’s not sure exactly how much the company got rid of, or how it did so, he knows it was “a lot.” But, he said, it was no longer in compliance with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards and the company knew it wasn’t going to be able to sell it anyway. Jeremy Hecker, chief of operations at the ski division of another wax company, Rex Wax, said the move away from fluoros resulted in up to $30,000 in “dead inventory” — containers of fluoros that have either been destroyed or are collecting dust in storage.

The FIS ban, while announced in 2019, did not take effect until the winter of 2023. Other sanctioning bodies, resorts and even towns across North America and Europe followed suit. Park City, for example, went fluoro-free in 2023 and allowed skiers and snowboarders to swap their stash for eco-friendlier options. TIn the fluoro ban’s first year, the city collected more than 600 pounds of the polluting wax during the ban’s first year.

Overall, the transition has worked “relatively smoothly,” said Knut Nystad, a wax technician for the Norwegian Ski Association. Kern, the U.S. cross-country skier, attributes that in part to the culture of the sport. “People in the cross-country community are very environmentally conscious,” she said. “They want to have clean water, they value their health a lot.”

That broad buy-in, however, doesn’t mean the change has been seamless.

One complication involves testing and enforcement. Because fluorinated compounds do not break down easily, traces can linger even on skis and snowboards that have been thoroughly cleaned, leading to false positives. But the steepest learning curve has been for the teams as technicians and athletes adjusted to a new generation of waxes.

“It took a while for technicians to learn the new chemistry,” said Julia Mehre Ystgaard, who works withcoordinates Canada’s Nordic World Cup team. Schultz said early fluoro-free waxes were “very inferior” to fluorinated options. “It was kind of crazy,” he said. A ski might feel “pretty good” in one sunny stretch of a course and “terrible” in a shadier section.

The modern alternatives still tend to be slower, and as U.S. cross-country skier Hagenbuch put it, they don’t do as well in late-season snow that’s warm and wet “like mashed potatoes.” He said it has become more common for his team to “miss the wax,” meaning skis aren’t well matched to the day’s conditions. Kern agreed, adding that the effect is especially noticeable on downhills. “You’re right behind [someone] at the top of a hill, and then they just pull away even though you’re in the draft where you should be pulling up on them,” she said.

That impact can be compoundingly decisive: Less glide at the bottom of a hill makes it harder to crest the next one, and less lubrication demands more effort to maintain speed. Suddenly an athlete is off the podium. Alpine and snowboard races are generally much shorter than Nordic events — minutes versus potentially hours — but the high speeds and friction also make wax choice critical.

“Fluoros were easier because fluoros were fast,” Hagenbuch said. “[They] have been referred to as, like, a ‘great equalizer.’”

Hurwitch, at Swix, says the new class of waxes are three to five years away from being as fast as the fluoros, and that company chemists are putting in thousands of kilometers of testing to reach that goal. Until then, however, the great equalizer is gone and other determinants of speed have taken on outsize importance. That, of course, includes physical conditioning and technique. You have to “make sure you have the steak first before you add the salt or the pepper,” said Nystad. But choosing the right equipment has become more important too.

The art of grinding skis has become especially critical. The process involves passing a ski or snowboard over stone, to inlay a pattern designed for a specific snow condition, or set of conditions, like a tire tread. Zach Caldwell, a former Nordic racer and owner of a Vermont ski shop, said this is one reason he’s seen a “dramatic” increase in the number of cross-country skis teenage racers buy: so they can have pairs optimized for different circumstances. Baucom, the wax tech, said these pre-wax decisions once accounted for 80 to 90 percent of a Nordic setup’s speed, but without fluoros they now account for as much as 97 percent.

The shift has raised concerns about competitive balance. While fluoros weren’t cheap, they were less expensive than perfecting grinds on an ever-larger armada of skis. Grinding machines alone can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and require tremendous expertise to run. Some athletes worry that this gives an advantage to countries like Norway — home to many major ski and wax companies — with deeper research budgets and larger wax tech teams.

Hagenbuch said fluoros “brought the delta between how good people’s skis were together.” Without them, the gaps are remerging. He pointed to a December skiathlon in Trondheim, Norway, where his teammate Gus Schumacher was in contention for a medal yet finished 21st. Something similar happened at a 50-kilometer race last March, where only one athlete on Schumacher’s brand of skis finished in the top 20.

“It wasn’t the wax. It wasn’t the athlete. … That was the skis,” said Hecker, with Rex Wax. And anyone with the wrong skis in Milano-Cortina will almost certainly miss their shot at the podium — something no amount of non-fluorinated wax will fix.

Even as fluorinated waxes disappear from competition, some athletes and technicians caution against assuming all problems have been solved. Nystad was among several people who noted that there’s no guarantee replacement products are benign. “A lot of people think that a fluoro ban means that now all waxes are healthy and you can almost use it as a jam on your sandwich and eat it,” he said. “But that’s not the case … You could have other chemicals in there that are not equally harmful, but that are harmful to nature and to individuals.”

Because formulas are proprietary, it can be difficult to know exactly what newer waxes contain. They likely include petroleum-derived ingredients that can transfer to snowpacks. Even so, some industry insiders question how much attention wax deserves compared with snow sports’ other environmental implications. “It doesn’t make sense to me to discuss the environmental impacts of this until we have really cleared house on the environmental impact of travel, and the food we eat, and the clothes that we wear,” Caldwell said.

Ski and snowboarding wax is also a minor contributor to the PFAS problem, globally. Crawford called it a “comparative drop in the bucket,” pointing to the fact that almost all commercial carpeting in the world is laden with PFAS. But the relative success of the ban in ski waxes is unique and could offer lessons — and hope — to anyone trying to get the chemicals out of other products.

“There are always options,” said Hurwitch, noting that none of Swix’s new products — from outerwear to waxes — contain PFAS. “The water repellency in jackets may not be as good as it was with a PFAS based product but it’s still a great product. The wax may not be quite as reliably fast, yet, but for the vast majority of us skiers, it’s still plenty fast. It will come though.”

The Olympic cross-country schedule begins Saturday with the women’s skiathlon. Kern will be racing at her second Games in temperatures that are expected to hover around freezing, where wax could be crucial. “We’re pretty much always testing skis,” she said. “We have to rely on and trust our wax team.”

Hagenbuch will make his Olympic debut in Milan Cortina. The ban creates additional stress, he admits, but he believes it’s worth it. “For Tim and the other service technicians and for me and for our groundwater and for the environment, yeah, I think it’s good that we don’t do fluoros,” he said. “Do I miss them? Yeah, a little bit.”

        Claim:

Musician Kid Rock sang "I like 'em underage" and "some say that's statutory" in the song "Cool, Daddy Cool."

In early February 2026, online users shared a rumor claiming that, decades earlier, musician Kid Rock released a song with lyrics that included "I like 'em underage" and "some say that's statutory but I say it's mandatory." Users claimed the lyrics appeared in the song "Cool, Daddy Cool," which was used in the 2001 part-animation, part-live-action film "Osmosis Jones." Snopes received reader mail highlighting the matter.

The claim circulated in the days after Turning Point USA announced (archived) Kid Rock would perform in the conservative organization's "All-American Halftime Show," an event competing with the Super Bowl's official halftime performance, which was set to be headlined by Spanish-language rapper Bad Bunny.

For example, on Feb. 3, a Threads user posted (archived) the lyrics with references to both halftime shows. The post read:

If you translate Bad Bunny's lyrics to English, he really isn't an appropriate pick to headline the Super Bowl Halftime Show.

"Young ladies, young ladies, I like 'em underage. See, some say that's statutory, but I say it's mandatory."

Oh wait..my bad. That's actually Kid Rock, headliner of the MAGA 'Christian' halftime show. So that tracks.

(@falynmarie/Threads)

Users also shared the claim on Facebook (archived), Instagram (archived), Threads (archived) and X (archived).

In short, Kid Rock, whose real name is Robert James Ritchie, truly released a song with those lyrics, though another performer sang part of the lyrics.

The song, "Cool, Daddy Cool," appeared on the "Osmosis Jones" soundtrack and is available on Spotify and YouTube. The track list on the soundtrack's CD case credits the song to "Kid Rock featuring Joe C." — a rapper whose real name was Joseph Calleja and who died in November 2000.

The movie itself, which was free for U.S. viewers via the Tubi streaming service, featured only part of the song and did not include the "underage" and "statutory" lines. The relevant scene begins around the 51:30 mark in the movie.

The movie's credits (at 1:34:26) say the song was written by Kid Rock (listed as Ritchie), Bob Crewe and Frank Slay Jr.

Snopes contacted the Creative Artists Agency to ask if a representative for Kid Rock wished to comment on the lyrics. We also emailed Turning Point USA to ask if the organization had a response to users sharing the claim and will update this article if we receive further information.

'Cool, Daddy Cool' lyrics

Song-lyric website Genius published a transcription of "Cool, Daddy Cool," noting which parts Kid Rock and Joe C. sang.

The third verse features the "underage" and "statutory" lines (emphasis ours):

Now, some people say my mind's blown, I'm coolin' like a snow cone

On my cell phone I'm paid, G, can't call me, just page me

Young ladies, young ladies, I like 'em underage, see

Some say that's statutory (But I say it's mandatory)

My story ain't that complex, two forties and a Rolex

I rip, I rock, I roll, G, I trim my hair with the Flowbee

Got soul, G, like Al Green, co-coolin' like the A-Team

From Maine to San Francisco, I'm shootin' like a pistol

I'm so slick, I'm Crisco, daddy likes to disco

The website noted with italics that Joe C. sang the "but I say it's mandatory" response to the "statutory" lyric sung by Kid Rock.

Kid Rock's character, 'Osmosis Jones' plot

IMDb.com published the plot for "Osmosis Jones" — directed by brothers Bobby and Peter Farrelly — as follows: "A policeman white blood cell, with the help of a cold pill, must stop a deadly virus from destroying Frank, the person they live in."

For the movie and soundtrack, Kid Rock provided the singing voice for an animated lime-green germ performing with a band of germs named Kidney Rock. The band sang "Cool, Daddy Cool" in a club named "The Zit." Kid Rock's character, who the film's creators left unnamed in the credits, featured attire somewhat similar to that worn by Kid Rock, including a fedora.

The satirical publication The Onion highlighted (archived) the song in April 2025 with the headline, "Trump Pardons Kid Rock For Whatever Inspired Statutory Rape Lyric In 'Cool, Daddy Cool.'"

        <hr/>
        For academics, historians and activists, the past year has been tumultuous in advocating the teaching of Black history in the United States.

Despite last year proclaiming February as National Black History Month, President Donald Trump started his second term by claiming some African American history lessons are meant to indoctrinate people into hating the country. The administration has dismantled Black history at national parks, most recently removing an exhibit on slavery in Philadelphia last month. Black history advocates see these acts and their chilling effect as scary and unprecedented.

“States and cities are nervous about retribution from the White House,” said DeRay Mckesson, a longtime activist and executive director of Campaign Zero, an organization focused on police reform. “So even the good people are just quieter now.”

In the 100th year since the nation’s earliest observances of Black History Month — which began when scholar Carter G. Woodson pioneered the first Negro History Week — celebrations will go on. The current political climate has energized civil rights organizations, artists and academics to engage young people on a full telling of America’s story. There are hundreds of lectures, teach-ins and even new books — from nonfiction to a graphic novel — to mark the milestone.

“This is why we are working with more than 150 teachers around the country on a Black History Month curriculum to just ensure that young people continue to learn about Black history in a way that is intentional and thoughtful,” Mckesson said about a campaign his organization has launched with the Afro Charities organization and leading Black scholars to expand access to educational materials.

New graphic novel highlights history of Juneteenth

About three years ago, Angélique Roché, a journalist and adjunct professor at Xavier University of Louisiana, accepted a “once-in-a-lifetime” invitation to be the writer for a graphic novel retelling of the story of Opal Lee, “grandmother of Juneteenth.”

Lee, who will also turn 100 this year, is largely credited for getting federal recognition of the June 19 holiday commemorating the day when enslaved people in Texas learned they were emancipated. Under Trump, however, Juneteenth is no longer a free-admission day at national parks.

Juneteenth helped usher in the first generation of Black Americans who, like Woodson, was born free. “First Freedom: The Story of Opal Lee and Juneteenth,” the graphic novel, comes out Feb. 10. It is the culmination of Roché’s assiduous archival research, phone chats and visits to Texas to see Lee and her granddaughter, Dione Sims.

“There is nothing ‘indoctrinating’ about facts that are based on primary sources that are highly researched,” said Roché, who hopes the book makes it into libraries and classrooms. “At the end of the day, what the story should actually tell people is that we’re far more alike than we are different.”

While Lee is the main character, Roché used the novel as a chance to put attention on lesser known historical figures like William “Gooseneck Bill” McDonald, Texas’ first Black millionaire, and Opal Lee’s mother, Mattie Broadous Flake.

She hopes this format will inspire young people to follow Lee and her mantra — “make yourself a committee of one.”

“It doesn’t mean don’t work with other people,” Roché said. “Don’t wait for other people to make the changes you wanna see.”

Campaign aims to train new generation of Black historians

When Trump’s anti-DEI executive orders were issued last year, Jarvis Givens, a professor of African and African American Studies at Harvard, was thousands of miles away teaching in London, where Black History Month is celebrated in October. He had already been contemplating writing a book for the centennial.

Watching Trump’s “attack” cemented the idea, Givens said.

“I wanted to kind of devote my time while on leave to writing a book that would honor the legacy that gave us Black History Month,” Givens said.

The result is “I’ll Make Me a World: The 100-Year Journey of Black History Month,” a book with four in-depth essays that comes out Tuesday. The title is a line from the 1920s poem “The Creation” by James Weldon Johnson, whose most famous poem, “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing,” is known as the “Black National Anthem.”

Givens examines important themes in Black history and clarifies misconceptions around them.

The book and the research Givens dug up will tie into a “living history campaign” with Campaign Zero and Afro Charities, Mckesson said. The goal is to teach what Woodson believed — younger generations can become historians who can discern fact from fiction.

“When I grew up, the preservation of history was a historian’s job,” Mckesson said, adding his group’s campaign will teach young students how to record history.

How the ‘father of Black history’ might feel today

Born in 1875 to formerly enslaved parents, Woodson was among the first generation of Black Americans not assigned to bondage at birth. He grew up believing that education was a way to self-empowerment, said Robert Trent Vinson, director of the Carter G. Woodson Institute at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The second Black man to earn a doctorate at Harvard University — W.E.B. Du Bois was the first — Woodson was disillusioned by how Black history was dismissed. He saw that the memories and culture of less educated Black people were no less valuable, Vinson said.

When Woodson established Negro History Week in 1926, he was in an era where popular stereotypes like blackface and minstrelsy were filling in for actual knowledge of the Black experience, according to Vinson. This sparked the creation of Black history clubs and Woodson began inserting historical lessons “on the sly” in publications like the “Journal of Negro History” and the “Negro History Bulletin.”

“Outside the formal school structure, they’re having a separate school like in churches or in study groups,” Vinson said. “Or they’re sharing it with parents and saying, ‘you teach your young people this history.’ So, Woodson is creating a whole educational space outside the formal university.”

In 1976, for the week’s 50th anniversary, President Gerald Ford issued a message recognizing it as an entire month. There was pushback then over the gains the Civil Rights Movement had made, Givens said.

As for today’s backlash over Black and African American studies, Vinson believes Woodson would not be surprised. But, he would see it as a sign “you’re on the right track.”

“There’s a level of what he called ‘fugitivity,’ of sharing this knowledge and being strategic about it,” Vinson said. “There are other times like in this moment, Black History Month, where you can be more out and assertive, but be strategic about how you spread the information.”

Resistance to teaching Black history is something that seems to occur every generation, Mckesson said.

“We will go back to normalcy. We’ve seen these backlashes before,” Mckesson said. “And when I think about the informal networks of Black people who have always resisted, I think that is happening today.”

        <hr/>
        The College Football Playoff schedule is seen as inefficient compared to the NFL's postseason.

Leaders recently moved a playoff game to avoid a scheduling conflict with the NFL.

A new, fixed playoff schedule ending with the championship on New Year's Day would be big improvement.

Of all the change and disruption and uncertainty over the last five years of college football, nothing is more perplexing in the new NIL world.

Somehow, the sport’s leaders can’t even control the controllable.

This season, the NFL — a financial goldmine of success and popularity — will play 13 playoff games in 30 days, finishing the annual joy ride Sunday with Super Bowl LX.

Clean, neat, efficient.

Next season, College football — a financial whirlwind of the overwhelmed, stuck in a glass booth cash grab and frantically stabbing at anything that moves — will play 11 College Football Playoff games in 39 days.

Dirty, messy, inefficient.

To say nothing of completely wrecking the college football player procurement calendar, and putting undue stress on coaches and players, and recruitable high school players.

“It’s not that difficult to figure out,” Oregon coach Dan Lanning told me last month before the CFP quarterfinals. “Too many excuses, not enough action.”

Yet there was the CFP earlier this week, announcing next year's quarterfinals would move off New Year's Eve to avoid a scheduling conflict with a regular season NFL game. That's the game plan, everyone: a malleable CFP, that works for all ― including the NFL.

The questions is why? Why won’t college football’s leaders — apparently, SEC commissioner Greg Sankey and Big Ten commissioner Tony Petitti, at the behest of their 34 university presidents — construct a playoff that begins the week after conference championship games and ends on New Year’s Day?

A day later, the transfer portal opens for two weeks. Clean, neat, efficient.

You’re not competing with the NFL for television eyes, you’re not pushing the sport well into the second semester. This is your postseason, it will not change year to year. Period.

This is how you build a predictable and successful product that lasts and sustains, and grows year over year. You know, like the NFL.

It's only the most important piece to the future financial wellbeing of college football, so maybe we should focus on it. Whaddya say, everyone?

The postseason is everything in all sports. It determines champions, it delvers drama, it’s what television craves. It earns big, big dollars.

Yet those in charge of college football can’t stop mucking it up.

This has nothing to do with the number of teams in the CFP, it has everything to do with when the dang thing is played. That's the most important piece to this puzzle going largely ignored.

Why wouldn’t the 34 presidents of the SEC and Big Ten simply move back the season one week — to the current Week Zero spot — and play championship week on Thanksgiving weekend? The first person who screeches “tradition!” gets flogged with a wet noodle.

Gimme a break. Tradition?

You’ve dissected the sport into unwieldy Power quarters, eaten your own in the process, opened the doors to unregulated free agency and all but ignored academics.

Tradition limped off the road a couple of exits back, bub.

The week after Thanksgiving is the first round of the CFP on campus. The second week of December — where bowl games can still be used and celebrated — is for the quarterfinals. The third week of December is the semifinals, and New Year’s Day is your national championship game.

I think we can all agree the best place for the national championship game — on a day college football has owned forever — is the majestic Rose Bowl. Every single season, at 4 p.m. ET., with the sun setting on the picturesque San Gabriels at the start of the second half.

There’s your nod to tradition. I'm getting goosebumps just writing it.

A 16-team field doesn’t change this format, but a 24-team field would move the start of the season one week earlier. That’s right, those poor, overworked coaches and players ― in the ridiculous 24-team scenario ― will have to start the season in the third week of August. And take their millions with them.

The postseason is now a multi-billion dollar business. Run it like one.

Build it, sustain its scheduling predictability, and protect its money-generating viability from the NFL’s greedy paws.

The NFL gets free player development from college football, is given free access to coaches and game tape during the season to scout players, and still refuses to defer to college football with scheduling conflicts.

The NFL is in it for the NFL. It’s time college football becomes all about college football.

Make a schedule, and stick to it. And make billions.

Control the controllable.

        <hr/>
        Tigers ace pitcher Tarik Skubal won his arbitration case against the club, securing a $32 million salary that shatters all prior records for a player in the arbitration system but also raises plenty of questions regarding his and the sport’s future.

Nearly a month after filing for arbitration, the two-time reigning Cy Young Award winner in the American League secured every bit of his historic salary request, prevailing over a competing, $19 million offer from the Tigers for the 2026 season. With the win before a three-person panel, Skubal shattered the prior record for an arbitration-eligible pitcher, $19.75 million for the Tigers’ David Price in 2015, in both nominal and inflation-adjusted terms.

The decision was also the largest arbitration salary decided by a panel, beating the $19.9 million decision for Blue Jays first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. in 2024. The $13 million gap, meanwhile, between Skubal’s arbitration request and Detroit’s offer was also unprecedented.

Skubal’s upcoming salary additionally beats the $31 million arbitration figure for outfielder Juan Soto in 2024, settling on that figure with the Yankees before he ultimately reached a record-setting $765 million contract with the Mets late that year in free agency. Skubal settled last year with the Tigers on a one-year deal of $10.15 million for 2025, avoiding a hearing, and with the latest victory, will more than triple his salary.

Ripple Effects

The historic situation surrounding Skubal promises to have widespread impacts in Detroit and across the league.

Players with between three and six years of major league service can go to arbitration to resolve salary disputes, but more than 90% eligible players settle their cases. Skubal, however, tested the system like no one before him.

This could very well be the beginning of the end of Skubal’s decorated tenure with the Tigers, as MLB arbitration history involved this type of division between a player and a team often leads to eventual divorce. Skubal will be a free agent after the 2026 season, where he is again likely to command a massive salary on the open market.

Skubal is represented by Scott Boras, one of the sport’s most powerful agents and one who has struck many market-setting deals.

The entire arbitration system, meanwhile, is set to be revisited as MLB owners and players are beginning labor negotiations in advance of the Dec. 1 expiration of the current pact. Those talks are expected to be fractious as a growing economic divide and large-scale media disruption continue to cause friction.

Arbitration eligibility is often the first time that a player can have a real say in their compensation, as signing bonuses after the MLB draft, minor-league salaries, and initial major-league salaries are all typically preset.

During the last set of collective bargaining talks between owners and players in 2021–22, MLB sought to eliminate the arbitration system and replace it with a performance-based model. The union resisted that, and instead negotiated for higher minimum salaries as well as a $50 million bonus pool for high-performing, pre-arbitration players.

Despite Skubal’s significant victory, he will still earn less this year than fellow pitcher Framber Valdez, newly signed in free agency by the Tigers. Valdez’s three-year, $115 million deal will pay him $38.3 million for 2026, and the average annual salary set a record for a left-handed pitcher.

        <hr/>
        As if the Lindsey Vonn comeback couldn’t get any more dramatic.

Unless you’ve been hibernating in a cave, you may have read that Vonn, the comeback queen of American ski racing, is enduring a rollercoaster ride in the final days before the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics.

After dominating the Downhill World Cup in November and December, Vonn, 41, crashed hard on January 30 during a warmup run ahead of the Crans-Montana World Cup. As far as ski racing crashes look, this one appeared bad—Vonn had to be airlifted from the slope.

A few days later, she announced the extent of the damage: a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), bone bruising, and damage to her meniscus. Despite these wounds, Vonn told reporters that she is powering ahead toward the women’s Olympic Downhill, which will be held on Sunday, February 8.

“Every day my knee’s gotten better,” Vonn told The Associated Press on February 3. “And every day we’re discussing with a full medical team, doctors, physios, everyone, to make sure we’re doing everything to make sure I am making smart and safe decisions.”

What a Doctor Says About Lindsey Vonn’s Torn ACL

Since then, the Internet has been abuzz with experts weighing in on Vonn’s decision to race, despite her injured knee. The ACL connects your thigh bone (femur) to your shin bone (tibia), and provides stability to your leg when your knee is bent. Sounds pretty important, right?

Well, it turns out that other elite skiers have competed despite having torn the ligament. Three weeks after tearing her ACL, Italian downhiller Sofia Goggia won a World Cup race in 2022. Vonn even raced in the 2014 Olympics in Sochi with an ACL tear.

I recently spoke to Dr. Kevin Stone, an orthopedic surgeon in California and ACL expert, who was also the U.S. Ski Team’s doctor from 1988 until 2002. Dr. Stone told me an ACL tear during skiing is usually traumatic and leaves an athlete hobbled and with agonizing pain.

“What typically happens when you rupture the ACL skiing is you jam the tibia forward into the femur, the tibia bruises the bone and tears the stabilizing meniscus cartilage,” he said. “That combo leads to swelling and pain and instability right away.”

Yeah—not exactly the condition you’d want to be in when hurtling down an icy ski slope at 70 miles per hour.

When I brought up the fact that other ski racers have competed with a torn ACL, Dr. Stone laughed and reminded me that “not every ACL tear is the same.”

“When you hear about athletes who skied well on their ACL, it’s often because they tore it a while ago and then learned to accommodate skiing without it,” he said. “But yes, there are pro athletes who are able to accommodate a somewhat unstable knee and still perform.”

Dr. Stone characterized these patients as having a “chronic” ACL tear—it’s a long-lasting injury that is sometimes not fixed. Vonn’s tear is acute—she is only a few days removed from the crash.

I’m simplifying Dr. Stone’s analysis of Vonn’s injury here: the timing of it totally sucks. Had she ruptured the ACL several weeks ago, her body and brain would have time to heal and adjust to the injury. But Vonn only has a few days until go-time.

Still, Vonn has sounded confident in her decision to go forward. So has her coach, Chris Knight.

“I’m pretty confident that she can still pull off this dream,” Knight told The Associated Press on February 4. “I’ve got no doubts in my mind that this is going to be OK.”

Dr. Stone told me that Vonn, Knight, and the rest of the world will find out whether or not she can compete in Cortina at the exact same time. Her first training descent on the Cortina Downhill course will be the make-or-break point, Dr. Stone said.

“If she can do a training run, then the likelihood that her injuries are too severe to compete is low,” he said.

Vonn was slated to complete a practice run on the Cortina course on Thursday, February 5. But bad weather and heavy snow have now pushed the practice run back to Friday, February 6.

Thus, American ski racing fans—and more than a few orthopedic surgeons—will be watching Vonn’s run while crossing their fingers, knocking on wood, and rubbing lucky rabbits’ feet during the descent. Dr. Stone told me he will be one of them.

“We may get our answer the first time she tries to arc a turn, and definitely the first time she goes off a jump,” Dr. Stone said. “We’re all going to be holding our breath.”

I know I will be.

        <hr/>
        Super Bowl LX is finally here! It was 22 weeks ago that we were staring at the start of a new season and the MMQB’s writers and editors looked into their crystal balls to see how it would all unfold. We’ve checked the tape and, nope, nobody had Seahawks-Patriots as the final game with the Lombardi Trophy on the line.

But here we are, and it is an interesting matchup. We’ve had coverage all week on the two teams still standing. Plus, Super Bowl history lessons with rankings of the 60 greatest moments and a look back at Super Bowl III with Joe Namath. But you are probably here for our thoughts on this upcoming game, so let’s get right to our staff picks and bold predictions.

Conor Orr, senior writer

Albert Breer

Seahawks 23, Patriots 20

MVP: Jaxon Smith-Njigba

The Patriots’ path to a win here is by taking this game to the place their first three playoff games went—a rockfight, predicated on a tough team betting on itself in the fourth quarter. If New England wins, I think Drake Maye will have to play his best game and make plays with his legs, the run game will have to shorten the game, and the interior of the defensive line, behind Milton Williams and Christian Barmore, will have to exploit the middle of the Seahawks’ offensive line. There are a lot of ifs there. And while I have a ton of respect for what New England’s accomplished, and have a hard time picking against them in this spot, I just think the Seahawks have too many answers, and a much wider road to get to the podium stand around 10 p.m. ET.

If Seattle can handle the Patriots’ defensive tackles, there’ll be matchups to exploit in the pass game, and Kenneth Walker III should have some room to run, and the Seattle defensive line is so tough and physical. And I think it all adds up to a loaded Seattle team being just a little too much for a Patriots team that’s accomplished a lot.

Bold prediction: Smith-Njigba will match Demaryius Thomas’s record for receptions by a receiver in a Super Bowl, with 13 catches. (Running back James White had 14 in Super Bowl LI.) I think JSN has become the NFL’s toughest cover—there may be better receivers in the league, but I don’t think there’s one right now that’s harder to erase from the game, regardless of what you throw at him, than the 23-year-old phenom. So I think Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak is going to find matchups, and the player who once had 15 receptions for 347 yards and three touchdowns in a Rose Bowl (that’s not a misprint) will cement his reputation as a big-time big-game weapon.

Conor Orr

Patriots 17, Seahawks 16

MVP: Robert Spillane

This selection is going to horrify Patriots fans, because I have picked against the team every single week of the playoffs so far. But I am bored with the obvious assertion that Seattle is a better team that will simply outmatch New England. That is probably true. I would imagine if I were a member of the Seahawks, I’d be supremely confident right now going into the game. However, there is always another possibility in this world and I am willing to explore the idea that something incredibly catastrophic happens early on and the game just spirals in another direction. Again, it is unlikely, but this process is about me and getting my cheap thrills wherever they come. But, we just saw Curt Cignetti turn around Indiana. Perhaps Mike Vrabel will pull a similar stunt with the Patriots, who were 4–13 last year. In order for the Patriots to win the game, they are going to have to earn turnovers in bunches. This means throwing Sam Darnold off his spot, preventing play-action and, ultimately, getting lucky.

Bold prediction: Robert Spillane will recover a fumbled toss sweep and take it 91 yards for a touchdown at the start of the second half, bringing the Patriots back to life after a dormant first two quarters and changing the tenor of the game from there.

Gilberto Manzano

Seahawks 25, Patriots 24 (OT)

MVP: DeMarcus Lawrence

By now, if you don’t believe in Sam Darnold you’re just stubbornly holding onto preconceived notions from his first three seasons with the Jets. Surroundings matter in the NFL, and Darnold has found a home with a loaded Seattle squad that got very good, very fast in two years with coach Mike Macdonald.

While the Seahawks have the better roster, the Patriots won’t be outmatched because coach Mike Vrabel has formed a stout defense in his first season in New England. I can see Milton Williams, Christian Gonzalez and the rest of this tough Patriots defense giving Darnold fits early in the game, but Darnold has had impeccable timing with star receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Even in the ugly games, Darnold and Smith-Njigba seem to connect when it matters most. Having the ability to make clutch plays amid a chess match—and there will be high-level coaching from both sides with Macdonald and Vrabel standing on the sidelines—will make all the difference in what could be a close game for four-plus quarters.

Drake Maye has a bright career ahead of him, but he has struggled throughout the postseason. The way his offense stalled for long stretches in its first three playoff games could hurt New England against a star-studded Seattle defense. Then again, Maye made enough plays to get the Patriots out of the AFC despite facing the dominant defenses of the Chargers, Texans and Broncos.

As you can tell, I’m a bit indecisive about how this one will play out, but I think Darnold will find a way to end one of the best comeback stories of all time with a Lombardi Trophy in Santa Clara.

Bold prediction: I won’t count my Super Bowl MVP pick as a bold prediction. After all, Lawrence did have two scoop-and-score touchdowns in one half against the Cardinals earlier this season. However, this will be Darnold’s award if this prediction occurs: Super Bowl LX will end with a two-point conversion in overtime, just like in Week 16, when the Seahawks beat the Rams to become the first team in NFL history to have a walk-off two-point conversion in overtime. They’ll do it again here for all the marbles, as Darnold connects with Smith-Njigba for the walk-off score.

Matt Verderame

Seahawks 30, Patriots 17

MVP: Kenneth Walker III

The Patriots have enjoyed a tremendous ascent. Last year, they won four games, had one of the league’s weakest rosters and punctuated the season by firing a one-and-done head coach in Jerod Mayo. Coming into 2025, there was hope of a major jump after hiring Mike Vrabel while also signing a litany of impact free agents including Stefon Diggs, Milton Williams, Carlton Davis III, Robert Spillane, Mack Hollins and others to pair with second-year quarterback Drake Maye

However, while the Patriots are a good team and an excellent story, the Seahawks are coming into Super Bowl LX as the rightful favorite. Seattle went 14–3 in the regular season while posting terrific wins over the Rams, 49ers, Texans and Jaguars, among others. The defense leads the league in points allowed, has a secondary with stars in Devon Witherspoon, Nick Emmanwori and Coby Bryant, and an offense featuring the league’s leading receiver in Jaxon Smith-Njigba.

For New England to win this game, it’ll need to survive a leaky offensive line, which has allowed 15 sacks in three postseason games. It will also need to plaster the Seahawks’ receivers with its trio of quality corners in Christian Gonzalez, Marcus Jones and Davis. And finally, the Patriots must force a few mistakes from San Darnold, who, although he’s having a dream season, also had the third most interceptions in 2025 with 14.

Bold prediction: The game will essentially be over by halftime because the Seahawks will pressure Maye on more drop-backs than not. Maye was sacked 47 times this season, fewer than only Geno Smith, Cam Ward and Justin Herbert. Seattle coach Mike Macdonald will have Maye running for his life all evening, much like Patrick Mahomes was against the Eagles a year ago.

Greg Bishop

Seahawks 19, Patriots 16

MVP: Rashid Shaheed

The Seahawks are the choice. This isn’t because I see Super Bowl LX as a blowout, although that’s possible. The NFL players I’ve spoken with this week all echoed the same theme—it will be closer than the general public seems to anticipate. Why? Start with the quarterback. Everything I’ve seen ranks the quarterbacks in this game as fairly even. The 2025 season screams that that’s not true. Nothing against Sam Darnold. He’s legit. Even those who said he couldn’t prove it when it mattered cannot spew such nonsense now. But look at Seattle more closely, right when it became truly, fully, must-watch dominant. What changed? Special teams. Which started with a special player, Shaheed, whom the Seahawks traded for at the deadline. He ranked fourth in yards per return. He sped downfield on reverses. He all but ended the divisional round game by returning the opening kickoff for a score. More than that, Shaheed changed games—with one play, sometimes; with a handful, at others. If Seattle is to win a game of field goals, which is what Jadeveon Clowney, who has played for both coaches, told me earlier this week is what he expects, then it’s hard not to see Shaheed and of his signature Seattle game-changing plays as the separator.

Bold prediction: Most remember Mike Vrabel, NFL linebacker, for fierce hits, bloody noses and championship rings. Some might have forgotten his side gig—as a legitimate, big-bodied, sure-handed (sorta) red zone threat. On offense. Scoring touchdowns rather than preventing them. Hence my prediction: that a Patriots linebacker will score an offensive touchdown in Super Bowl LX. The bet here is Jahlani Tavai. He’s got size (6'2", 255 pounds), speed, power and, most importantly, versatility. Tavai played 70% of all Patriots snaps this season on defense and special teams. He can add offensive threat to his résumé Sunday.

Michael Rosenberg

Seahawks 23, Patriots 9

MVP: Nick Emmanwori

Here is a fun question: Which quarterback is more likely to make costly mistakes? I would bet that 99.2% of you said “Sam Darnold,” which is understandable, what with him being Sam Darnold and all. But look closer.

Counting the postseason, Darnold has thrown 14 interceptions and fumbled 12 times; Drake Maye has thrown 10 interceptions and fumbled 14 times. Darnold has been sacked on 5.6% of his dropbacks; Maye has been sacked on 9.8% of his dropbacks. Seattle’s defense has intercepted more passes, forced more fumbles and registered more sacks than New England’s.

Is Maye a better player than Darnold? Of course he is! But that’s not the question I asked. Which quarterback is more likely to make costly mistakes in this game, against the defense he is facing? I think Seattle’s defense will get to Maye a lot more than New England’s will get to Darnold, and Maye will take sacks, commit turnovers or both.

One other point: Maye took a lot of sacks in college as well. I’m not saying that is Maye’s fault. I think it is mostly a function of playing behind mediocre lines at both the college and pro level. But it’s easy to assume that because Maye is big, and so good on the run, that he is difficult to sack. That has just not been the case.

I picked Emmanwori as MVP because I think Seattle’s defense will decide the game, and he is as likely to make the biggest plays as anybody.

Bold prediction: Bill Belichick will appear on the Seahawks’ sideline wearing Maye’s North Carolina jersey and a headset. He will watch Darnold throw three touchdown passes, leading millions of Americans to declare that if Sam Darnold can win a Super Bowl, NFL quarterbacking just isn’t what it used to be—which will, of course, be stupid. During the Tom Brady–Peyton Manning era, Nick Foles, Trent Dilfer, Joe Flacco and Brad Johnson all won Super Bowls. Manning won one in his final year, when he was a shell of his old self. Just be happy for Darnold if he wins this, and leave the petty cheap shots to Belichick and Robert Kraft.

Andrew Brandt

Seahawks 30, Patriots 13

MVP: Sam Darnold

First, an admission: While I correctly predicted an Eagles rout of the Chiefs in last year’s Super Bowl, I don’t have the same confidence level I had last year with my current pick. Having said that, I have the same feeling as last year that we have one team on a different level than the other. The Eagles had more talent than the Chiefs at roughly 20 of the 22 starting positions; the Seahawks have more talent than the Patriots at roughly 15 to 16 of the starting positions.

While the Seahawks are not a great offense, they are a better one than anyone the Patriots have played in the playoffs, and better than most they played all year. And while the Patriots have a good defense, the Seahawks have an elite defense. Again, it won’t be a complete rout like last year, but it will be a decisive win.

Bold prediction: The Seahawks will break the record for most sacks by a team in the Super Bowl. It will not be a surprise, at least to me, if Drake Maye is sacked six-plus times in this game. In fact, I'll boldly predict eight sacks which would break the record of seven, which has been done four times.

John Pluym

Seahawks 28, Patriots 24

MVP: Rashid Shaheed

Anybody who knows me knows that I’m a Vikings fan. I have been for over 50 years. So, if my team can’t be in the Super Bowl, having Minnesota’s former quarterback lead the Seahawks to the Lombardi Trophy is almost just as good. However, I’m also a closet Patriots fan, so this one’s a little tough for me. In the end, this game comes down to who plays better on defense, and there’s no doubt that Seattle has the edge. Drake Maye struggled mightily against Denver’s defense, and I expect him to struggle against Mike Macdonald’s unit, too. Still, if Maye can throw the ball as effectively as Matthew Stafford did against Seattle, then maybe the Patriots have a shot. But I’m going to choose to live on the Dark Side.

Bold prediction: There were several trades at the Nov. 4 deadline, but none better than Seattle’s acquisition of wide receiver and return specialist Rashid Shaheed. The Seahawks sent 2026 fourth- and fifth-round draft picks to the Saints for the playmaker, and Shaheed has been nothing short of spectacular. You want bold? I’ll give you bold. How about Shaheed scoring three touchdowns, including two special teams scores? He will be the most dangerous weapon on Super Sunday.

Mitch Goldich

Seahawks 27, Patriots 16

MVP: Kenneth Walker III

Picking Walker as my game MVP is not a commentary on Sam Darnold, simply a recognition that I don’t think the Seahawks will need very much from their much-discussed and much-scrutinized quarterback. I’m predicting Seattle will get two touchdowns either directly from their defense/special teams or on very short fields as a result of a big play from their defense/special teams. I think the Seahawks will be ahead early, and content to run the ball and avoid big risks with Darnold. Those big plays from defense and special teams will be made by a handful of contributors up and down the roster, leaving Walker as the most logical pick for the award after what feels like a truly complete team win.

And that’s really what it comes down to for me overall. I think the Seahawks are a really complete team, and that will show in the game Sunday. I don’t think we’re getting away from the fact that the NFL is a quarterbacks’ league where having the right one under center is the ultimate cheat code that gives you margin for error everywhere else on your roster. But it was at least interesting to see a few teams this year rise up as contenders on the strength of their defense. The Seahawks were overlooked all season, even after clinching the NFC’s No. 1 seed, and if they can finish this dream season off with a championship, history will probably still remember them as a great team. Though you may not think of them the same way you do the teams with Hall of Famers under center, 15 years from now, you’ll say, “You know what team is really underrated …”

Bold prediction: Ever seen a Super Bowl with zero touchdown passes? Probably, it happened in Super Bowl LIII (Patriots 13, Rams 3) and Super Bowl 50 (Broncos 24, Panthers 10), but those are the only times this century. I am predicting it will happen again this week—which would mean zero touchdown passes in two full Super Bowls at Levi’s Stadium. I just explained my reasoning on the Seahawks above, so let me go bold and say the same goes for the Patriots. I don’t envision any big-play touchdowns in the passing game, and Drake Maye can run it in himself if he gets close to the goal line.

Clare Brennan

Seahawks 24, Patriots 17

MVP: Sam Darnold

As David Foster Wallace once said, “Clichés earned their status as clichés because they’re so obviously true.” And there is perhaps no more enduring cliché in sports than defense wins championships. This maxim feels even more poignant in a season dominated by sturdy defenses. While the Seahawks and Patriots have both been impressive on defense, Seattle holds an edge. Mike Macdonald’s four-man rush is likely to give New England trouble, with Drake Maye struggling under pressure throughout the postseason. If the Patriots want to score against this stingy Seahawks defense, they’ll need to protect their QB and/or enable Maye to get the ball out quickly.

New England’s defense could decide the game, too. But the Patriots will have their work cut out for them, with Jaxon Smith-Njigba dominant against man coverage. And if Sam Darnold performs as he did against the Rams in the NFC championship game, it will be a long night for Mike Vrabel’s team.

While there are certainly areas where the Patriots can find success—like forcing turnovers—they have a much narrower margin for error than the Seahawks. Seattle can win in myriad ways, while New England will have to pick its spots and muck things up to pull out a victory. Simply put, the Seahawks are the more talented and battle-tested team.

Bold prediction: Bad Bunny will bring out Cardi B during his halftime performance. The pair appeared on the 2018 track “I Like It” together with J Balvin, and the song was a smash, hitting No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Cardi B also just performed on SNL and is set to go on tour this month. The move would make sense from both artistic and promotional perspectives, but there is, of course, also a personal element to this. Cardi B’s boyfriend, and the father of her son, Stefon Diggs, will be battling for a ring with the Patriots. Imagine New England and Diggs hoisting the Lombardi Trophy after Cardi B graces the stage with Bad Bunny—pop culture delirium.

        <hr/>
        SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Nobody on the Seattle Seahawks has supported Sam Darnold quite like Ernest Jones IV.

When Darnold threw four interceptions against the Los Angeles Rams in a 21-19 loss in Week 11, Jones had his quarterback’s back. The second-team All-Pro linebacker wouldn’t allow Darnold to take the blame.

“Sam’s been balling,” Jones said after that game. “If we want to try and define Sam by this game, man, Sam’s had us in every game. So, for him to sit there and say, ‘Yo, that’s my fault,’ no, it’s not. There were plays defensively we could have made plays, or opportunities where we could have got stops.

“This is football. He’s our quarterback and we’ve got his back.”

Darnold rewarded his teammate’s faith. He led the Seahawks back from a 16-point, fourth-quarter deficit to an overtime win against Los Angeles in the next meeting and was sensational in Seattle’s 31-27 victory over the Rams in the NFC championship game.

“Like I said, doubt Sam if you want to, Sam’s gonna show you every time,” Jones said afterward. “That’s who we know, and that’s why I stood on that, and I’ll do it all over again.”

Darnold has earned plenty of trust in the locker room in his first season in Seattle after a breakout year in Minnesota. Once considered a bust after the Jets drafted him No. 3 overall in 2018, Darnold — on his fifth team in eight seasons — is one victory away from leading Seattle to the franchise’s second Lombardi Trophy.

Darnold and the Seahawks face Drake Maye and the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl on Sunday in a rematch from a matchup 11 years ago.

Tom Brady and the Patriots won that one, 28-24, after Russell Wilson’s pass from the 1-yard line in the final minute was intercepted by Malcolm Butler.

That gave Brady, coach Bill Belichick and the Patriots the fourth of their sixth Super Bowl rings before the dynasty ended.

First-year Patriots coach Mike Vrabel, a standout linebacker on three of those championship teams, has quickly turned a team that was coming off consecutive 4-13 seasons into a winner.

Maye has been the catalyst for New England’s impressive turnaround.

“From Day 1, I feel like the guys have really taken what Coach Vrabel has wanted to do with us and have just really applied it to their lives in every single way,” Maye said.

“Whether it’s on the field, off the field, getting treatment, doing little things, making great decisions off the field. I think the biggest thing is just — Coach Vrabel always says he treats us how we treat the team. I think that’s how guys have taken this year, and I think it’s just rallying together and wanting to play for each other. From there on, we just have had fun doing it every single day since, and it’s been a ride. Looking forward to trying to finish it off.”

Brady also was a second-year quarterback when he led the Patriots to their first Super Bowl title in the 2001 season.

They were double-digit underdogs when they beat the Rams. The Pats were favorites in their next eight Super Bowl appearances until now. New England is a 4 1/2-point underdog this time around.

The 23-year old Maye, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 draft, will be the second-youngest quarterback to start a Super Bowl. Ben Roethlisberger was the youngest to win one when he led Pittsburgh to a victory over Seattle in the 2005 season.

Maye has demonstrated plenty of poise in clutch situations. He changed a play and ran a bootleg to extend the drive on third down late in the AFC championship game against Denver to seal a 10-7 victory in the snow.

“I think just as we’ve gone through this entire year in this program, and the more that he’s been out there and the games have kind of built up on us that, really, we’ve done a nice job in those situations,” Vrabel said of Maye’s maturity in big moments. “I think he’s improved in them, and he’s a big part of why we’re here, obviously.”

Of course, both teams are far more than just their quarterbacks.

Darnold has All-Pro wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, running back Kenneth Walker and Seattle’s defense is the stingiest in the league. The Seahawks allowed the fewest points in the NFL and have standout players at every level. Defensive tackle Leonard Williams, linebacker Jones and cornerback Devon Witherspoon were second-team All-Pros. Safety Nick Emmanwori had a standout rookie season.

Maye has running backs TreVeyon Henderson and Rhamondre Stevenson, wide receiver Stefon Diggs and the defense has been dominant in the playoffs.

Only one team will leave Santa Clara, California, with the Lombardi Trophy.

        <hr/>
        On Sunday, the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots will meet in Super Bowl LX. But we might as well call it the Explosive Play Bowl.

The big play has always mattered, but in the past few years, NFL games have become battlefields between teams trying to create and prevent explosive plays. Defenses, tormented by quarterbacks like Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen, have leaned into Vic Fangio-style philosophies and continued to raise their rates of two-high safety looks, funneling teams toward the run and short passes. Teams played two-deep shells more than 45% of the time on early downs in 2025, up from 38% in 2020 and 35% in 2017.

Offenses have evolved too. They've taken what the defense has given, running the ball more often and with more efficiency than in past years. Quarterbacks have been forced to make small profits and take the safer pass. With a leaguewide increase in willingness to go for it on fourth down, third-and-short has become an opportunity to hit those explosives, while third-and-medium has become a situation where the run is still in play.

The league's rule changes have also altered the way teams play offense. The move to a dynamic kickoff and placing touchbacks at the 30-yard line (in 2024) and 35-yard line (in 2025) have made it more difficult to play the field position game as a defense. The average drive after a kickoff starts with 69.3 yards to go for a touchdown, 5 full yards ahead of where it was five years ago.

The league also changed the rules for preparing K-balls during the week, which has combined with better technique and a generation of stronger-legged kickers to create compressed fields. Even as recently as 15 years ago, NFL teams were punting if their drives were stopped short of the opposing team's 35-yard line. Now they're going for it on fourth down once the ball crosses their own 40, and they're in field goal range when they cross the opposing team's 40. Kickers hit 60.6% of their attempts from 55 yards or more this season, up from 48.1% in 2020.

All this has created a league where explosive plays are the great differentiator. Manufacture one explosive play on offense after a kickoff, and you're probably already in field goal range. Successful defenses either force a ton of takeaways or stall the opposing offense from hitting a big play, trusting that they'll come up with a sack, force a penalty or produce a negative play to throw the offense off-schedule. Great offenses either force teams out of the two-high world by running the football too effectively and have quarterbacks who can break defenses down by using their legs or reliably hitting throws into narrow windows downfield. Having an uncoverable receiver or two helps.

And so, over the past three years, as the league has gone further into its new form, winning the explosive-play battle has been critical. (There are a lot of ways to characterize explosive plays, but the definition I'm using here is any run of 12 or more yards or any pass of 16 or more yards.) Teams that produce more explosive plays than their opposition have won 61.2% of the time. Teams that win the turnover battle -- the classic, traditional measure of playing smart football -- have won 59.1% of the time. The Patriots (plus-3) and Seahawks (minus-3) ran turnover margins toward the middle of the pack this season.

It should be no surprise then that the best teams at creating and stopping explosive plays made it through the postseason. In terms of explosive-play differential -- the gap between the rate at which teams generated explosive plays and prevented their opposition from doing the same -- each of the four teams in the conference championship games ranked in the top five during the regular season. The Rams created explosives 12.6% of the time on offense and allowed teams to make their own only 9.5% of the time on defense, with that resulting 3.1% difference being the third-best mark in the league. The Packers (3.2%) were second, and the Broncos (2.3%) were fifth.

The Patriots were in fourth at 2.8%, buoyed by a league-best explosive creation rate of 13.6% on offense. And the Seahawks, who will be favored on Sunday, outpaced everyone. Their 4.7% explosive-play differential was the best mark in the NFL and the ninth-best figure posted by any team of the past 25 years. And they were truly elite on the defensive side of the ball, meaning we'll get the league's best offense at creating explosive plays versus the league's best defense at stopping them Sunday.

Of course, one-game variance can swamp regular-season stats. The six best teams by explosive-play differential over the past 25 years all made it to the Super Bowl; they all lost. A Patriots defense that was ordinary during the regular season by advanced metrics has allowed just six explosives through three postseason games while playing a series of compromised, injury-impacted offenses. The Seahawks gave up 12 explosives to the Rams in the NFC Championship Game.

They won that matchup because quarterback Sam Darnold responded to two months of middling football by playing one of the games of his life. His opponent, Drake Maye, has followed an MVP-caliber regular season with a wildly inconsistent postseason, mixing turnovers with spectacular plays.

In this postseason, we've seen individual games decided by unexpected injuries, fumble luck, missed kicks and ill-timed weather systems. One of those unpredictable factors might decide Sunday's game too. All things being equal, though, this should be a fun Super Bowl matchup of two of the league's explosive-play kings in 2025 (6:30 p.m. ET, NBC). Whoever manages to win that battle in Santa Clara, California, should be the favorite to take home the Lombardi Trophy. Let's see if we can figure out who might have the inside track.

How the Seahawks' defense breaks the rules

While Mike Macdonald doesn't come from the Fangio tree and doesn't run the same defense, their philosophies share some common ground and break opposing offenses in similar ways. The Seahawks want to live in two-deep safety shells pre-snap and force the quarterback to process post-snap, daring them to take the safe checkdown. They play two-deep coverages after the snap nearly 57% of the time on first and second down, the third-highest rate of any defense. One of the two teams ahead of the Seahawks is the Chargers, whose defense was run by Jesse Minter, Macdonald's former colleague in Baltimore.

Macdonald's defense then compounds the lean toward the pass by operating almost exclusively out of subpackages. The Seahawks have a deep, talented secondary, led by superstar cornerback Devon Witherspoon. Macdonald wants to get as many of those defensive backs on the field as possible. The Seahawks are in their base defense just 5.7% of the time on first and second down, which is comfortably the lowest rate in the NFL. The league average is 35.2%.

The Seahawks are committed to staying in their nickel and dime groupings just about everywhere away from the goal line. In the NFC Championship Game, the Rams leaned heavily into their 12 (one back, two tight ends) and 13 (one back, three tight ends) personnel groupings, trying to overpower the Seahawks or get them to play their base defense and put a third linebacker on the field. Seattle faced 40 plays from those groupings and stayed in nickel on 36 of them. Even with the Rams having plenty of success working out of those packages, averaging nearly 10 yards per play and posting a 55% success rate, the Seahawks were nickel-or-bust against multi-tight end sets.

More often, it's the opposing offense that busts. Playing two-deep shells and staying in nickel or dime at the highest rate in the league on early downs should be a red carpet for opposing teams to run the football. The Seahawks have eight men in the box against the run on early downs only 7.7% of the time, lowest in the league. And they have a numbers advantage versus the opposing run game in those spots only 20.8% of the time, fourth lowest. They're behind the Eagles (Fangio's team), the Rams (under Chris Shula, who incorporates Fangio principles from his time working under Brandon Staley) and the Panthers (whose defense is run by Ejiro Evero, another former Fangio and Staley assistant).

And yet, the Seahawks have the best run defense in the NFL on early downs. They allow 3.5 yards per carry and minus-0.13 EPA per play against designed runs on first and second downs, No. 1 in the NFL. Their 64.6% success rate against those runs is the third-best mark. And as you can probably guess, they don't allow big runs; the Seahawks allowed just seven explosive runs on early-down designed runs all season, fewest in the league.

Macdonald's defense dares opposing teams to run and then beats them at the game they want to play, pushing the offense behind schedule. They challenge opponents to thumb wrestle and then beat them with their pinkie.

The Macdonald defensive rebuild

How does he do it? The same way every great coach does it -- with excellent players who fit his scheme. Macdonald has turned over much of the defensive rotation over the past two seasons. Of the 15 most used defenders from Pete Carroll's final season with the organization in 2023, nine are no longer on the roster. Of the six who remain, Jarran Reed and Boye Mafe are in reduced roles from where they were two years ago. Uchenna Nwosu, who missed most of 2023 with a torn pectoral muscle, has been healthy for much of 2025.

Instead, Macdonald has gotten more out of players who were already on the roster, made meaningful additions in the draft and imported talent that fits the style of defense he wants to play. By getting more of what was already there and making the right additions, he has turned the Seahawks from a frustrating, disappointing unit into one of the league's best defenses in two years, just as he did in Baltimore.

Unheralded players on the bottom of Carroll's roster have grown into bigger roles. Macdonald moved benched slot cornerback Coby Bryant to free safety, where he has excelled in coverage, allowing a 54.0 passer rating in coverage this season. Backup safety Ty Okada has stepped in when Bryant and Julian Love have been injured and stood out, with the special-teamer proving to be one of the league's more reliable tackling defensive backs.

There's a special place in the lineup for starting linebacker Drake Thomas, an undrafted free agent in 2023 who played just four defensive snaps as a rookie. There was interest in Thomas entering the league as a special-teamer, but as a 228-pound linebacker with middling athleticism markers, there weren't many teams who saw him as even a reserve linebacker, let alone a starter. Instead, Thomas has taken Tyrice Knight's spot in the starting lineup and popped this season. Playing behind an excellent defensive line, his instincts and ability to quickly diagnose run concepts have played up. He has batted away eight passes and made 10 tackles for loss, creating explosive plays for the Seahawks on defense. He has filled what had been a problematic position for Macdonald in 2024.

General manager John Schneider deserves credit for importing the right guys too. The Seahawks signed Josh Jobe off waivers from Philadelphia in 2024 and built him into a solid outside cornerback. The Rams and Titans both gave up on Ernest Jones IV in 2024, and when the Seahawks decided that free agent addition Jerome Baker wasn't working out, they ate a sunk cost and traded Baker and a fourth-round pick to the Titans to add Jones.

In one of the rare cases of a player getting traded twice in six weeks and then emerging as a Pro Bowl-caliber talent, Jones has been transformative for the Seahawks' defense. Macdonald's run defense was 15th in EPA per snap against designed rushes before Jones arrived last season; it has been the league's best since then. Jones' ability to control opposing run games from light fronts (and alongside a 228-pound starter) has freed up the Seahawks to play in Macdonald's vision. And Jones, 26, allowed a 54.0 passer rating in coverage this season, intercepting five passes. Two of those were on tips and one was on the snap where Max Brosmer lost his mind, but Jones has been able to create explosive plays.

While Darnold was the team's most notable free agent signing last offseason, Schneider made a quietly valuable addition by bringing in veteran DeMarcus Lawrence. He had a resurgent year as a pass rusher after fading during his time with the Cowboys, but his most significant impact has been as an elite run defender on the edge -- another critical element for the Seahawks as they try to stop the run with two deep safeties, a nickel on the field and a 228-pound linebacker. Lawrence's ability to set the edge has been noticeable against zone runs, something I'll get to more in a moment. And he made one of the plays of the postseason for the Seahawks by coming off his assignment and doubling Kyren Williams in coverage on fourth down in the NFC title game, something Rams coach Sean McVay characterized as a "fortuitous bust" afterward.

In Baltimore, Macdonald had Nnamdi Madubuike, who emerged as a superstar pass-rushing defensive tackle in the coach's second and final year as coordinator. Macdonald was lucky to inherit a standout tackle in Leonard Williams, but it seemed telling that Schneider's first draft pick with Macdonald in town was a young defensive tackle with the potential to be a disruptive 3-technique.

Byron Murphy II is not quite on Madubuike's level yet, but after a quiet, injury-impacted rookie season, he managed seven sacks and 13 quarterback knockdowns in his second year. He ranked 16th in pass rush win rate and 14th in pressure rate among interior linemen. Playing next to Williams helps, but Murphy has taken over games for stretches in 2025, with noticeably impressive showings against the Cardinals and Titans during the regular season.

The key rookie for this Seattle defense

I left the most unique player for last. Rookie safety Nick Emmanwori might be the skeleton key that makes this work. The Seahawks traded up to get the superathlete with the 35th pick in last year's draft. South Carolina had used Emmanwori as both a free safety and a strong safety in the box, but since his arrival into the NFL, Macdonald has been loath to use the 21-year-old as a deep safety, instead leaning on Love, Bryant and Okada to play those roles.

Emmanwori has instead been the team's nickel defender and jack-of-all-trades player near the line of scrimmage. During the regular season, NFL Next Gen Stats listed Emmanwori for 326 snaps as a slot cornerback, eight snaps as an outside cornerback, 12 snaps as a safety, 250 snaps as an outside linebacker, 34 snaps as an inside linebacker, 77 snaps as an edge rusher and nine snaps as a defensive tackle. Emmanwori is not necessarily taking on the responsibilities of a defensive tackle when the automated methodology records him as lining up in that role, but that range gives you an idea of how comfortable Macdonald has become with moving his rookie defender around the lineup.

Most often, Emmanwori is essentially playing a linebacker's role in Seattle's defense alongside Thomas and Jones while leaving Macdonald with the ability to drop him into coverage against a slot receiver, a tight end or a running back out of the backfield. It's easy to draw that up on paper, but coaches need a true superstar in the mold of Derwin James Jr. (who Minter had in Los Angeles) or Kyle Hamilton (who worked with Macdonald and will now work with Minter as the latter takes over in Baltimore) to actually hold up in coverage while regularly taking on blocks from linemen while fitting the run.

Emmanwori might not be quite as spectacular of a playmaker as James and Hamilton, but at 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds, his physicality and ability as a blitzer stands out. He has 2.5 sacks, four knockdowns and nine tackles for loss in 11 starts this season. He's better in tight quarters than he is having to cover large swaths of space as a deep safety, and it's tough for even great offensive playmakers to separate from his length and athleticism. The Rams loved getting to Kyren Williams on choice routes in key spots this season, and one of the few times it didn't work was when Emmanwori fought through a pick to close down Williams and tackle him short of the sticks on third down before a fourth-down stop.

There are better players on this defense, but Emmanwori is the piece that really makes so many other things fall into place. His presence in the lineup allows the Seahawks to stay in those subpackages regardless of what the opposing team sends out in terms of offensive personnel. However, Emmanwori hurt his ankle Wednesday in practice, so that will be something to monitor.

With all these playmakers, the Seahawks can control other teams on the ground with lighter personnel and box counts. And because they can do it without needing to commit extra defenders, that leaves five defensive backs with two deep safeties to limit explosives.

How the Seahawks win with four

It's not just about the run, of course. Macdonald's defense is excellent against the pass, creating significant pressure without blitzing. The Seahawks posted the league's fifth-best pressure rate this season at 35.2%, despite blitzing at the sixth-lowest rate. Macdonald has sim pressures and creepers in his playbook, but Seattle runs them about 3.6% of the time, which is just below league average. And while the Seahawks have plenty of good pass rushers, there's no Myles Garrett or Micah Parsons in the mix as the sort of super-rusher who keeps opposing offensive coordinators up at night.

Instead, the Seahawks win with a four-man rush by collapsing pockets and using twists and defensive line games to create difficult blocking angles, forcing offensive linemen and running backs to communicate in real time. One common tactic the Seahawks use is a "pick stunt," where an athletic player like Emmanwori sprints toward the hip of an offensive lineman while a D-lineman twists behind. It's nominally a way to create a rushing lane for an end or a tackle, but in practice, the pick player is usually the one who finds his way through to create pressure. If the offensive lineman isn't aware of what's coming or isn't agile enough to stop it, the results can be spectacular.

The Patriots have two key targets in pass protection the Seahawks will exploit. One is running back TreVeyon Henderson. While the rookie has gotten better as a blocker as his debut year has gone along, his early-season struggles have meant that opposing defensive coordinators routinely go after Henderson in pass pro. Macdonald will use twists, overloads and the occasional blitz to pick on Henderson in pass protection, forcing the rookie to both make the right decision and actually win his block cleanly. The Patriots might respond by simply keeping Henderson off the field; he played just four offensive snaps against a ferocious Broncos front during the AFC Championship Game.

The other player the Seahawks will target isn't coming off the field. Rookie left tackle Will Campbell has been an upgrade on the various replacement-level options the Pats lined up on Maye's blind side in 2024, but the fourth overall pick is still a below-average pass blocker at this point of his career. During the regular season, Campbell allowed 8.5 sacks in 13 games. Opposing pass rushers generated quick pressures on 3.6% of their snaps against Campbell, the ninth-worst rate in the league among left tackles.

Campbell suffered a knee injury late in the year and missed four games in December. Since returning, he has been an outright liability. We've seen pass rushers such as Khalil Mack and Will Anderson Jr. bull rush through Campbell for pressures, while Anderson and Odafe Oweh have also gone around him for strip sacks. In three postseason games, Campbell has allowed four sacks, 15 pressures and seven quick pressures. His 6.8% quick pressure rate during the playoffs would be the worst mark for a full-season starter on the blindside.

It's fair to note that Campbell has played a murderers' row of great pass rushes. And for all the deserved talk about how the Patriots played one of the easiest schedules in recent league history during the regular season, it's only fair to note that they've faced a brutal stretch of opposing defenses during the playoffs. During his first run to the Super Bowl, Maye will have played the best (Seahawks), third best (Texans), sixth best (Chargers) and seventh best (Broncos) defenses in the league by EPA per defensive snap.

The results, outside of a second half mostly spent running the ball in awful conditions in Denver, certainly haven't been boring. Maye has thrown two picks and fumbled a whopping six times, the latter most often a product of holding on to the ball a tick or two too long. It's easier to get away with that against the Jets and Titans than it is against the Texans and Chargers. Maye was better about getting the ball out against the Broncos, although he was lucky to avoid an interception when Denver fooled him by passing off coverage on his first third down of the game, only for safety Talanoa Hufanga to drop a would-be INT. (Darnold, coincidentally, threw a pick in the Week 16 win against the Rams into a virtually identical trap.) If Maye holds the ball for those extra beats against the Seahawks, the results are going to be fatal for the Patriots.

Of course, Maye has also been involved as a runner or passer on 18 of New England's 22 explosive plays on offense over that three-game span, which has helped make up for those giveaways. He has had a handful of absolutely perfect passes, including the fourth-down slant that set up the opening touchdown against the Texans (which weirdly doesn't come up when anyone talks about how offenses should take the points). And he has layered in a series of flawless throws on corner routes, including a 31-yard completion to Mack Hollins on the flea-flicker the Patriots dialed up in the snow against the Broncos.

I laid out how and why the Seahawks are the best defense in the league when it comes to limiting explosive plays. But remember that the Patriots are the best offense in the league at creating those explosive plays. How do they do it? I watched every explosive play the Pats put together this season -- and each of the ones the Seahawks allowed -- to get a sense of how the Patriots stand out and whether they'll be able to create those big plays in the Super Bowl.

Maye and the Pats' big-play machine

The Patriots created explosive plays on 13.6% of their offensive snaps during the regular season. Some wrote that off as a product of their schedule. But as I said in my MVP discussion, while the Patriots as a whole played an easy schedule, the actual defenses Maye faced were much closer to league average and in line with what Matthew Stafford faced in Los Angeles.

While getting a much tougher slate of opponents in the postseason, Maye and the Patriots have still managed to generate explosives on 11.5% of their plays. Take out the fourth quarter of the Broncos game, when the Patriots were working into the wind in the middle of a snowstorm and running the ball into the line to chew up clock, and that jumps to 12.5%. The Broncos were just behind the Seahawks in explosive play rate on defense, but the Patriots still had six of them in three quarters before sitting on the ball in the fourth. The Patriots have made more mistakes against great defenses in January, but the stiffer competition hasn't stopped them from producing huge gains on offense.

Of course, there are a lot of ways to create explosive plays. Like many other quarterbacks of this era, Maye generates them with his legs, taking advantage of defenses that are pushing their safeties downfield and whose linebackers are stretched thin at the second level. Maye produced 11 explosives on scrambles this season, just behind guys such as Caleb Williams (13) and Justin Herbert (12) and ahead of Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes (both 10).

Quarterbacks such as Allen and Mahomes also create explosives by extending plays and breaking defenses with their passes on scramble drills, long after the initial route combinations have been taken away. The two future Hall of Famers each generated nine explosive plays this season on throws where they held the ball for more than five seconds. As good as NFL defenses have become at taking away big plays, no defense is going to consistently hold up in coverage for six or more seconds per play, especially if they're facing a quarterback who's capable of putting the ball anywhere he wants.

While Maye is capable of extending plays to produce completions and did so regularly throughout 2025, what's noticeable is how many of the big plays he generates come within the rhythm and structure of the offense. The second-year pro had just four explosive completions come after five seconds. A league-high 77 of Maye's big plays came within what's typically considered the standard rhythm of pass plays, with the ball coming out after 2.5 seconds and before the five-second mark.

The only other quarterback in the league within 10 explosives of Maye in that time window was Stafford, who was also the only QB carving up the Seahawks down the stretch. Over the second half of the year and into the postseason, the Seahawks allowed a 77.4 Total QBR to Stafford and a 31.5 mark to all of the other quarterbacks they've faced. That's roughly the difference between how Maye (77.1) and Dillon Gabriel (31.5) performed in 2025.

And what's even more remarkable and unique about Maye and the Patriots is the sheer breadth of concepts they used to create explosives. Darnold and the Seahawks offense created plenty of big plays themselves, but those were mostly built around a few core pass concepts that we'll hit on in a bit. Maye worked defenses with everything. He hit seven explosives in rhythm on slants, seven off digs and seven from variants of Y-Cross. Those are all in-breakers, but Maye also added plenty more explosives on outs, sails and flats. Josh McDaniels, who had a great year as offensive coordinator, found opportunities for Maye to hit playmakers of all types out of the backfield on choice routes.

Where Maye was at his best, though, was throwing vertically. He hit hole shot after hole shot to either sideline, throwing fades and go routes into tiny windows against zone coverage. When teams gave his tight ends or wideouts space over the middle of the field, Maye was both ready to throw the ball into dangerous places and consistently good at putting his passes exactly where they needed to go.

Maye was excellent at diagnosing post-snap coverage shifts. Here's a good example of how all those things come together. Going up against the Bengals in Week 12, Maye was facing a third-and-11 from deep inside his own territory. The Bengals spun their safeties after the snap and played Tampa 2 coverage, with two deep safeties and a linebacker trying to take away the traditional hole in that coverage in the middle of the field by running with any vertical threat. Because the Bengals tried to disguise their coverage, though, linebacker Barrett Carter had a long way to go to catch up with DeMario Douglas out of the slot. Maye recognized the coverage and threw a perfect seam route to his wide receiver for 37 yards.

New England's most reliable way for creating explosive plays, though, was isolating a cornerback in coverage on either sideline and trusting Maye to deliver a perfect ball off the defender's leverage. He was excellent at throwing back-shoulders when cornerbacks were in man or playing tight coverage, and he consistently put fades and routes over the top in places where only his receiver had a shot at the football. You saw a good example of that in the divisional round win over the Texans, when Kayshon Boutte made a stunning catch past star cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. for a 32-yard touchdown.

If you're going to create explosive plays against the Seahawks, well, that's how they're typically going to happen. Stafford was able to hit digs and in-breakers into small windows and stretch Seattle's linebackers in coverage, but most of the explosive plays the Seahawks allowed this season came when offenses had the time to attack their cornerbacks. Riq Woolen can be susceptible to double moves, like the one Puka Nacua hit on him for a touchdown in the NFC title game. Josh Jobe, meanwhile, can be physically overwhelmed when he's on the field.

Even Devon Witherspoon, Seattle's best cornerback, can have moments when receivers get right on him and overpower him. Witherspoon fell down twice in coverage on completions to Davante Adams in the NFC Championship Game. Marvin Harrison Jr. also helped set up a late touchdown in September with big catches in tight coverage against the 2023 first-round pick. And while Emmanwori is a force near the line, when offenses have been able to force the rookie to work in space and chase opposing receivers in man or trail coverages, they've been able to hit big completions against him too.

Maye was the league's best quarterback on deep throws outside the numbers this season, posting a 98.3 Total QBR. He also tried and hit a lot of those passes, throws that other offenses are frankly terrified of having their quarterbacks attempt. The only QB who completed more deep passes down either sideline was Stafford, who was fifth in Total QBR on those same throws.

The Seahawks were the league's second-best defense in Total QBR in terms of taking away those throws. Guess who gave them problems? Stafford, who went 15-of-24 for 521 yards and two touchdowns on deep throws outside the numbers in three games against the Seahawks. He posted a 98.7 Total QBR on those passes. The only QB who posted a better figure against the Seahawks on more than one such attempt was Baker Mayfield, who went 6-of-8 for 174 yards and a 100.0 Total QBR on those throws in Seattle earlier this season.

Mayfield and Stafford are responsible for the three worst games of the year for the Seattle defense, with Mayfield & Co. dropping 38 points on a Witherspoon-less Seahawks team in October, while Stafford's offense scored 37 points in December and 27 in the postseason rubber match. If you're looking for a case where the Patriots defy expectations and play more like the few offenses that gave the Seahawks real problems in 2025, it's here. A Patriots win probably would require a few big throws by Maye over the outstretched arms of cornerbacks.

The other way to attack aggressive, intelligent defenses is to fool them. McDaniels has never lacked for trick plays, and with two weeks to prepare for the Super Bowl, I would be shocked if he didn't have something unexpected in the playbook for Sunday. McDaniels learned from Bill Belichick, who adored coaching legend Paul Brown, who was a proponent of using trick plays before opponents got a chance to do the same. Don't be surprised if you see a trick play from the Pats on offense before Bad Bunny performs at halftime.

At the same time, there's uncertainty about whether we'll be getting a healthy version of Maye in the Super Bowl. He was reportedly dealing with a shoulder injury after the AFC Championship Game, although he seems ready to go for Sunday. Assuming he is close to 100%, the second-year QB also should be able to create with his legs. Maye's aggressive vertical movement within the pocket allows him to both exit for sudden scrambles and minimize the yards lost by any potential sack.

The Seahawks don't rely heavily on using a spy against mobile quarterbacks, instead trusting their pass rushers to maintain their gap discipline and collapse the pocket back into the QB, eliminating the room he needs to make those dangerous forward scrambles. They also just haven't faced many signal-callers who lean on their legs beyond individual games against Kyler Murray, Trevor Lawrence and Jayden Daniels. I'll be intrigued to see if Macdonald has some unexpected bespoke packages to handle Maye as a runner with those two weeks of prep. Maye has been great at finding uncovered running backs for huge gains when defenses have been focused on him and let Henderson or Rhamondre Stevenson slip out of the backfield, and the Seahawks can't afford to make that same sort of mistake .

One other way for the Patriots to try stretching the Seahawks would be to work out of empty. Offenses generally didn't go empty against Seattle this season, given that they were playing against sub packages anyway, but the Seahawks were 20th in EPA per play against empty looks on defense over a 54-play sample.

I suspect that their plan will revolve more around running through Seattle. With Maye struggling and subpar weather conditions in two of their three playoff games so far, the Patriots have run the ball 49% of the time on early downs in neutral game scripts. That's up from a 43.4% clip during the regular season, which was the sixth-heaviest pass lean in the league. A 49% early-down run rate during the regular season would have been slightly ahead of league average.

Weather is not expected to be a concern in Santa Clara, but McDaniels still might lean into the run on early downs to keep Maye grounded and create manageable third downs for his young quarterback. The Patriots know what they're getting from Macdonald in terms of defensive personnel, so they might feel like they can gain a size advantage by going with bigger groupings and multi-TE sets on offense, as the Rams did in the NFC title game.

Where the Patriots run the ball might be as important as who runs it. After their bizarre move to a zone scheme about five years too late under Joe Judge and Matt Patricia in 2022, McDaniels has returned and restored a more diverse rushing attack alongside offensive line coach Doug Marrone. The Pats hit many of their biggest plays this season off duo, taking advantage of their backs' vision and ability to accelerate through tackles in the open field. They'll use the crack toss concept to try to seal off Seahawks edge rushers lined up outside the tight ends.

The Patriots still have some zone runs in their playbook, though, and the Seahawks show a pronounced split in where those zones hit. When facing zone runs where the back's path hits the C or D gap -- which we would typically associate with outside zone -- the Seahawks allow 3.0 yards per carry and minus-0.19 EPA per rush attempt, both of which are the best marks in the league. The Seahawks are just so stout on the edges, and it's tough to get much payoff if you can't budge the likes of Lawrence and Nwosu.

When those same zone runs target the A and B gaps -- which we would associate with inside zone -- the Seahawks give up 4.7 yards per carry and 0.06 EPA per attempt, which rank 26th and 27th, respectively. (Runs to the B and C gaps might also be considered midzone, but we're trying to keep things simple here.) The Pats were better running outside zone than inside zone this season by EPA per play, but they might have more luck hitting their runs to the interior in this game.

There's also the possibility that we see a lot of Thayer Munford Jr., who has quietly become a more important part of the Patriots' offense. There has been a leaguewide shift toward using six offensive linemen more often in 2025. In 2020, teams used a sixth offensive lineman on 2.6% of snaps, and those were mostly in goal line and short-yardage situations. There were teams that flirted with the tactic more often, including the Bills with Alec Anderson last season, but it wasn't a widespread pattern.

This year? Teams are using sixth linemen on 5.2% of snaps, doubling the rate from five years ago. That figure has risen to 7.0% in the postseason. Good teams notice what's working around the NFL and incorporate it, and the Patriots managed to add this to their offense in-season. Through Week 10, McDaniels had run a total of just five snaps out of six-lineman groupings. The tipping point really came in Week 15, when Henderson ran for 52- and 65-yard touchdowns on six-linemen snaps with Munford on the field against the Bills.

Since then, the Patriots have run an average of 14.5 snaps per game out of six-linemen sets. Munford, a 331-pound tackle, adds some significant heft and physicality to the Pats' offense, especially against a Seahawks team that will respond by staying in their nickel looks. At the same time, while we usually think about using a sixth lineman to get a bigger body on the field and attack on the ground -- and offenses of course use it for that purpose -- the real value that smart teams generate from those groupings is hitting explosive pass plays downfield.

Maye has averaged 9.4 yards per attempt when the Patriots have thrown out of six-linemen groupings, and the league as a whole has averaged 7.4 yards per attempt throwing in those sets. For years, teams were trying to create big plays by getting as much speed as possible onto the field. Now, offenses like the Patriots' are responding by instead focusing on size, manipulating defenses before throwing over them for a huge gain.

If the Patriots do score a bunch of points in this game on offense, they'll have two paths to getting there. One is by winning this explosive-play battle between the league's most dynamic offense and its most stifling defense. The other is a scenario where the Seahawks hand them a series of short fields with giveaways. For most of the season, Darnold was a legitimate MVP candidate. He also ran the league's highest turnover rate this season, thriving by -- you'll never guess -- creating explosive plays at one of the highest rates in the NFL. Darnold was the best quarterback in football over the first half of 2025 by Total QBR, only to fall to 24th over the past 10 games, a stretch which includes all three of those matchups with the Rams.

We just saw Darnold play arguably his best game as a pro, given the stakes, against a defense that tormented him three times over the prior 12 months. He is entirely capable of putting together a performance like that again. But he is also capable of throwing the Super Bowl away. No player in this game has a wider range of variance or a more direct impact on deciding who ends up winning the Lombardi Trophy.

Will the real Darnold -- or the real Patriots -- show up?

The NFC Championship Game win over the Rams was an outlier performance for Darnold. He had been struggling for the better part of two months, as the same Seahawks team that had won because of Darnold over the first half of the season was mostly winning games around him after the November loss to the Rams. Their run game improved, their defense grew even stingier, and the addition of Rashid Shaheed grew an already solid special teams into the league's best unit.

Darnold's performance two weeks ago wasn't just a statistical outlier; it was also a stylistic outlier. At his best in 2025, Darnold had leaned heavily into the play-action game that new offensive coordinator (and future Raiders head coach) Klint Kubiak brought along to Seattle. Against the Rams, Darnold went 17-of-25 for 248 yards and two scores without play-action. The 13.9 EPA Darnold generated on dropback passes in that contest was the third-highest total he has posted in a single game during his career.

Darnold also avoided negative plays. He took just three sacks, and two of them were essentially unavoidable hits from free rushers. He didn't put the ball in danger outside of a bobbled snap, which he quickly fell on for a 9-yard loss. Darnold has had clean games this season, including a turnover-free performance in the blowout win over the 49ers in the divisional round, but he has turned the ball over at least once in 11 of 18 games. The Seahawks, notably, are 8-0 in the games when Darnold doesn't commit a turnover.

After winning the rubber match against the Rams, I wrote that it was time to stop assuming that Darnold would turn into a pumpkin in the games that mattered most. I stand by that. It's not fair to say that a Darnold collapse is the most likely scenario in those games, given how he played in the biggest game of his life to date. He was solid against the 49ers in a divisional round game where the Seahawks didn't need him and great against the Rams the following week when they did. We've seen quarterbacks such as Eli Manning, Joe Flacco and Nick Foles get white-hot for a postseason run and lead their teams to Super Bowls. Darnold could be next in that lineage.

That all said, he could also still collapse; we're only a few weeks removed from a stretch where Darnold turned the ball over 10 times across seven games. It would be naive to pretend that a game like that is no longer in the range of possibilities for the eight-year pro, even if it's also simultaneously fair to say that Darnold's most likely performance isn't a stinker.

The guys on the other side might have something to say about that, because they're on a heater too. During the 2025 regular season, the Patriots' defense was all over the place per advanced metrics. New England was seventh in the league in points allowed per drive, 11th in EPA per snap, 18th in ESPN's Football Power Index and 23rd in DVOA.

The latter adjusts for strength of schedule, and as you already know, the Patriots played a very generous schedule of opposing quarterbacks. In addition to facing replacement-level backups such as Dillon Gabriel, Brady Cook and Quinn Ewers, the Pats faced just a handful of notable starters. They did play four games against Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow, but their toughest competition beyond that quarter of the season might have been games against the likes of Baker Mayfield, Aaron Rodgers and Bryce Young. It was a soft slate.

During the postseason, things also have broken well for the Patriots -- but in a different way. The offenses they've faced have been without key players. The Chargers didn't have starting tackles Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater. The Texans didn't have receiver Nico Collins and lost tight end Dalton Schultz in the first quarter, depriving C.J. Stroud of his top two receivers (three, if you include Tank Dell, who missed the entire season). The Broncos, of course, didn't have starting quarterback Bo Nix after he broke his ankle in the overtime win over the Bills. Life is easier against backups in key positions.

Still, I'm not sure we appreciate just how dominant the Patriots have been on defense during this postseason. Through three games, they've allowed a total of 26 points. They've done that despite Maye's turnover issues, which have handed the opposing offense five drives starting in Patriots territory. And they've allowed one touchdown drive from the opposing side of the field.

In all, the Patriots are allowing just 0.7 points per possession over their three playoff games. That's pretty rare company. The only team over the past 25 years to play three games in their conference bracket and allow fewer points per drive is the 2000 Ravens, who were at 0.4 points per possession. When you're being compared to a peak Ravens defense, you're in a good spot.

We rightly remember those Ravens as one of the greatest defenses of all time, but what's lost to history is that Baltimore also enjoyed some of the same luck the Patriots have had along the way. In the wild-card round, the Ravens played at home in 27 mph winds against a Broncos team without starting quarterback Brian Griese; Denver turned to backup Gus Frerotte and third-stringer Jarious Jackson in a 21-3 Ravens win. In the conference championship game, the Ravens knocked first-team All-Pro quarterback Rich Gannon out of the game with an injury in the second quarter, forcing the Raiders to alternate between Bobby Hoying and a compromised Gannon for the remainder of a 16-3 manhandling.

The Patriots aren't the 2000 Ravens on defense. But you get the idea: As time passes, we remember what teams accomplished more than how they got there or what help they had along the way. Just as Darnold might be able to piece together a stretch of three hot games and win a Super Bowl, this New England defense might be able to do its best 2000 Ravens imitation and stifle opposing offenses for a month too.

Other teams have pulled it off. The 2011 Giants were 25th in the league in scoring defense during the regular season, then held Aaron Rodgers, Matt Ryan, Alex Smith and Tom Brady to 14 points per game en route to a Super Bowl victory. It helps to be great all season if you want to be great for a month in the postseason, but it's not necessarily a prerequisite. And Patriots fans will rightly point out that they've gotten star defensive tackle Milton Williams back for the playoffs after he missed five games during the regular season with an ankle issue.

The Patriots will have to find a way to handle something few teams have been able to stop this season. Kubiak is finishing his third one-and-done stint in three tries as an offensive coordinator, but this time, he'll be leaving his current team to take over as the head coach of the Raiders. Kubiak's calling card, unsurprisingly, has been a modernized version of the offense his father, Gary, ran with the Shanahan family in Houston and Denver. The Patriots once changed the course of NFL offenses with a dominant defensive performance in their last Super Bowl appearance; now, they'll face the evolution of that attack in another title game.

The evolution of the Shanahan offense

In Super Bowl LIII, the Patriots delivered what I believed to be the best defensive performance in Super Bowl history, holding a fearsome Rams offense to one field goal in a 13-3 victory. A game that had a 55.5 over/under produced exactly one touchdown, when the Patriots ran the same play (Hoss Y-Juke) three times in a row to set up a Sony Michel touchdown plunge.

That game helped transform NFL offenses. The Patriots borrowed and popularized the scheme that Vic Fangio's Bears had run to slow down the Rams earlier in the season, playing a 6-1 front with quarters defense behind. The extended line prevented the Rams from stretching the Patriots with their outside zone-heavy approach, which then took away their play-action offense, much of which was built off the zone run concepts. Belichick turned Jared Goff into a dropback passer, and the Rams couldn't adjust. There's a direct line from that game to Sean McVay eventually giving up on his prize pupil and trading Goff to the Lions for Matthew Stafford.

Around the same time, defenses that were sick of being gashed by the play-action bootleg game found their own solution to slow that passing attack. The most frequent play-action concept off those zone runs saw the quarterback fake a handoff to a running back and wheel off in the opposite direction without any blockers, on what's popularly known as a "naked." The play-action fake put the backside defensive end away from the run motion in conflict, as the defender had to either chase down the run play from behind to try and prevent the running back from hitting an easy cutback or chase down the quarterback if he kept the football. Most of the time, the DE did neither.

At some point, defensive coaches actually went and did math. The outside zone game was tough to stop, but even a great running game averaged 5 yards per carry. The play-action passing attacks were producing 8-plus yards per attempt and a much higher rate of explosives. Coaches started telling their weakside edge defenders to ignore the run and just go after the quarterback. Losing a defender in the run game was going to make life more difficult, but the potential for taking away the play-action attack and getting free runs at unblocked quarterbacks for sacks was worth the risk.

Offenses adapted. McVay shifted his run game away from zone and built a new play-action offense on top of it. The league as a whole has shifted toward more gap scheme runs, which has made bigger interior linemen and backs with great vision more valuable. Play-action is still efficient, but the days of spamming the same flood or sail combination on naked bootlegs as the core component of an offense eight or more times per game seemed over.

And then Kubiak and Darnold showed up in Seattle and produced one of the most effective play-action games in recent memory. Darnold averaged nearly 11 yards per dropback with play-action, the best rate of the past decade among offenses that threw at least 100 play-action passes in a season. The prior record-holder was Matt Ryan, working under Shanahan during the former's lone MVP season in 2016. What's (a little) old is new again.

The best play in football

At first glance, Kubiak's offense looks a lot like the classic play-action boot game that made those Shanahan offenses great, stretching all the way to the John Elway days in the late 1990s. The fake gets the linebackers flowing the wrong way. Darnold boots to the sideline. He has three receivers heading his way, all crossing the field at different levels. He has a quick option in the flat, an intermediate receiver in the 10- to 12-yard range and a deeper target clearing out the coverage and presenting the opportunity for a shot play. The route combination floods zone coverage and allows for receivers to run away from man defense. Pretty good setup, which is why it worked for so long.

There's still outside zone boot play-action in this offense, but Kubiak does much more to complement and supplement that core concept. The 38-year-old didn't suddenly invent some new killer play, but Kubiak does an excellent job of dressing up the play-action game with a wider range of flourishes, creating a myriad of problems for defenses in the process.

Having watched every Darnold play-action dropback this season, there's a handful of wrinkles that stood out as essential in Seattle's success:

1. A much wider range of run concepts. Just as coaches from the Shanahan tree have needed to add more gap schemes to their zone run games to keep defenses off-balance, Kubiak has done the same in Seattle. More than 60% of Seattle's play-action passes this season have come off gap runs such as duo, power and trap. Kubiak typically uses Darnold under center, but their third-most frequently used play-action concept is lining Darnold up in the pistol and running play-action off counter, where the Seahawks pull two linemen and create dramatic throwing lanes for Darnold over the middle of the field.

What makes Kubiak's offense so flummoxing for defenses, though, is that he built a wide-ranging play-action game across those various run concepts. The Seahawks will fake outside zone and boot Darnold to the right -- but then they'll also reverse paths and boot Darnold to the left nearly 40% of the time, a concept Kevin Stefanski leaned into with Baker Mayfield during their time together in Cleveland. They'll also tease outside zone and then not boot Darnold at all, leaving an edge rusher hungry for a sack with no quarterback to feast upon as Darnold sits comfortably in the pocket.

In Kubiak's offense, Darnold might boot out to the sideline after faking duo or trap, plays that weren't as commonly associated with putting a QB on the move. And when teams do recognize that the same play-action flood concept is coming off a naked boot, Kubiak will have his deep receiver break the opposite way and have Darnold throw to the opposite side of the field for a huge gain. (Broncos fans will recognize this as the same concept Bo Nix hit a touchdown pass on in the divisional round, while Pats fans will remember Maye hitting DeMario Douglas for a 53-yard score on the same look against the Saints.)

2. Quicker solutions in the flat. One of the ways Kubiak and other coaches have mitigated the problem of edge rushers selling out to go after the quarterback on the boot game is giving the signal-caller more answers. Some quarterbacks have the athletic traits to routinely beat those edge rushers one-on-one in the open field to get out to the flat, which helps, but Darnold's not going to consistently do that time after time.

Instead, the Seahawks find ways to get that flat receiver open earlier for Darnold if he does need an outlet. Kubiak will use jet motion at the snap away from the fake to give the defense more eye candy and get Darnold an immediate place to go with the football if he's under pressure. That's typically not going to be a huge completion, but it turns a sack or a potential throwaway into a safe catch and positive yardage.

Many offenses around the NFL lean into using motion to help block up their runs, as they'll bring a blocker across the field to get him a head start as he tries to kick out a defensive lineman or linebacker on the edge. We saw offenses mix that up this season by having a blocker go in motion one way and then immediately change paths and head in the opposite direction at the snap. Kubiak used that on his counter plays to get a tight end in motion before the snap and then reverse the other way into the flat, often with favorable leverage, for an easy outlet.

3. Schematic choices that limit defensive creativity. Defenses are harder to figure out than they've ever been at the pro level. Coordinators have a wider menu of simulated pressures and exotic blitz concepts, owing in part to the fact that they have faster players on the field by playing in their subpackages more often.

McVay's mantra of playing the same personnel and making everything look identical until it isn't has been matched by coaches such as Fangio and Macdonald, who do everything they can to muddle the picture for quarterbacks, especially the ones who are successful turning their back to the defense for play-action fakes. It's one thing to spin your safeties and show one look to a quarterback pre-snap and another post-snap, but it's another to try and muddle your safeties' actual coverage responsibilities and leave the quarterback without the landmarks they might rely upon to deduce where to go with the football.

Both offenses and defenses try to do what they can to reduce the range of options available to the other side. Defenses try to use certain fronts or pressure looks to dictate potential pass protection calls, then take advantage of the protection they know to be coming. Offenses use motion, stacks and formational width to both get intelligence on what the defense wants to do and narrow down the range of what defensive calls might be available on a given snap -- then exploit what's left.

Kubiak's offense majors in three factors that help dictate defensive playcalls and make life easier for Darnold. One is putting the formation into the boundary, or what's commonly referred to as FIB. Putting the formation into the boundary means that a team starting a play on either hashmark puts the strong side of its offense on that same side of the field, which typically means it will have more eligible receivers releasing to that side after the snap. The Seahawks use FIB on nearly 12% of their offensive snaps, the second-highest rate in the NFL.

In one way, this goes against what teams typically want for their receivers: space. But at the same time, putting the formation into the boundary limits what defenses can do in response. There are only so many ways to check while dealing with stacks, bunches, picks and flood concepts to that side of the field. And because defenses don't see FIB all that often at the pro level, their reaction to those looks is more predictable. Offenses are also creating a lot of space to run into after the snap if they're going to run those receivers across the field -- which is exactly what Kubiak wants to do when he does boot Darnold the other way.

The Seahawks then use nub tight ends nearly 15% of the time, which is the second-highest usage rate in the league. A nub tight end is when a team lines up a tight end on one side of the field without any wide receiver split out to that same side, instead putting all of its other eligible receivers in the backfield and/or on the other side of the formation.

Again, that tactic isn't some genius move in its own right, but it's asking a very specific question from the defense. If you are playing zone, are you putting your cornerback on the line of scrimmage to take the tight end? Does that limit the range of coverages you can play on that side of the field? And if it's man, do you move your cornerback to the other side of the formation? Kubiak and Darnold can use those answers to help get a quicker sense of what's coming from the defense and how to attack it.

4. Going big. The other way teams have attempted to dictate defenses is by putting bigger bodies on the field. I mentioned earlier how offenses are using sixth linemen more often. Other teams are using multi-tight-end sets. The Rams made the most dramatic personnel shift of the McVay era this season. They used 13 personnel on a grand total of three snaps last season. In 2025, after Puka Nacua went down in a win over the Ravens with an ankle injury, McVay leaned into those three-tight-end sets and liked what he found. The Rams used 13 personnel roughly 29 snaps per game from that point forward. It was their primary grouping in the NFC Championship Game.

The goal is to force defenses into a bind. With nickel packages becoming the most commonly used personnel grouping on defense, organizations have optimized their investments around the idea that they're going to be playing five defensive backs most often. The success of those play-action attacks often came at the expense of overmatched run-stopping linebackers in the past, but with the shift to the nickel, defenses are typically getting those guys off the field.

Bigger personnel groupings dare defenses to put them back in the lineup. Stay in your nickel package against six-lineman sets or multi-tight-end groupings, and you're going to be physically overwhelmed by bigger bodies against the run. Most defenses want to play their base personnel, in either a 3-4 or a 4-3, against those bigger personnel packages.

The Seahawks' defense stays in nickel when facing 12 or even 13 personnel. It is an exception to the rule. But on offense, when the Seahawks line up in 12 personnel, opposing teams overwhelmingly line up their base defense in response. Defenses played their base defense nearly 74% of the time when the Seahawks were in 12 personnel this season. Some teams -- such as the Vikings, Jaguars and Falcons -- lined up in their base defense every single time the Seahawks sent out 12 personnel this season.

Let me make this very clear: Base defense against 12 personnel is exactly what Kubiak and Darnold want. The best play in football in 2025 was the Darnold play-action pass out of 12 personnel. He went 35-of-49 for 757 yards, three touchdowns and one pick when he used play-action from 12 personnel. That's a 71.4% completion rate and 15.7 yards per attempt. If it were a video game, you'd want to increase the difficulty.

Including all dropbacks, Darnold was 61-of-82 for 1,104 yards, six touchdowns and no interceptions throwing against base defenses this season, averaging 13.5 yards per attempt and posting an 87.0 QBR. He was 25-of-37 for just 215 yards, two touchdowns and three picks when he threw out of 12 against nickel or dime looks, and his 28.3 QBR on those throws was good for only 23rd out of 28 quarterbacks.

It's true that the Seahawks are more efficient running the ball when teams respond to 12 personnel by going with their nickel or dime defense, but that tradeoff is more than paid off for opponents by avoiding a devastating passing attack. The Seahawks have a higher success rate when teams play nickel, but because they aren't hitting as many explosives, they go from being the league's best offense by yards and EPA per play against base to a below-average offense against nickel or dime defenses.

The Patriots have been agnostic against 12 personnel this season. They play base 45% of the time and nickel 48% of the time. They're 16th in EPA per play allowed against those groupings when they line up in base and 15th in nickel. Their response to those groupings, though, changed dramatically from week to week. In Weeks 3 and 4, the Patriots were in their subpackages for 40 of 45 snaps against the Steelers' and Panthers' 12 personnel. Two weeks later, they were in base 100% of the time against the Saints.

You can probably guess where I'd urge the Patriots to land this week. Personnel issues might make the decision for inside linebackers coach Zak Kuhr and returning defensive coordinator Terrell Williams, who missed the entire year due to prostate cancer. But starting linebacker Robert Spillane is questionable for the game with an ankle injury. If he can't go or isn't 100%, the Patriots might have to choose nickel against 12 personnel by default.

Will the Patriots '1 Double' up on Sunday?

Another question, regardless of formation, is how the Patriots will choose to actually cover Seattle's receivers. There's obviously a huge focus here on Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who was arguably the best receiver in football this season, but the Seahawks have plenty of secondary playmakers. Cooper Kupp had a 60-yard game against the 49ers and a touchdown against the Rams. Rashid Shaheed started the Rams game with a 51-yard catch. AJ Barner had 519 receiving yards and six scores this season. After playing so many compromised offenses, the only place New England will see a weakened Seahawks team is with their secondary playmakers, as running back Zach Charbonnet (knee) and third wideout Tory Horton (shin) are out injured.

How the Patriots choose to cover Smith-Njigba will inform what they do with everything else. The conservative option would be to drop seven into coverage, live in split-safety shells, encourage the Seahawks to run the ball and trust that Darnold and the Seahawks' offense will make a mistake before the Patriots' defense does. Limit the Seahawks to field goals and maybe Maye wins the game with a couple of touchdowns.

The problem with that philosophy is New England's red zone defense was one of its biggest weaknesses on either side of the ball. Facing what I will again characterize as a moribund group of opposing quarterbacks, the Patriots ranked 30th in the league in opponent red zone conversion rate, allowing offenses to score touchdowns on 67.5% of their trips inside the 20-yard line. They've been much better in the postseason, of course, and red zone performance can fluctuate wildly from one stretch of football to the next, but I'm not sure coach Mike Vrabel should want this to be a game in which they're relying on what was a big problem for them during the regular season.

The alternative is more fun. When the Patriots signed Carlton Davis III during the offseason and joined him with superstar corner Christian Gonzalez, it seemed to hint toward them being one of the most man-heavy coverage teams in the league. Belichick's defenses had leaned heavily into man coverage when he had stars such as Darrelle Revis and Stephon Gilmore in the secondary, both because they were great talents and because the ability to play man afforded Belichick more schematic flexibility.

Man/zone coverage splits can differ from place to place depending on how they're being tracked, but the Patriots were not one of the league's leading man coverage teams in 2025. According to NFL Next Gen Stats, they used man coverage on 29.8% of opposing dropbacks, which was the 12th-highest rate in the league. That's still above league average, but it wasn't anywhere close to what I would have anticipated from the Pats given their cornerbacks heading into the season.

Then in the AFC Championship Game, Gonzalez & Co. manned up. They played man coverage on 48.6% of Denver's dropbacks, their second-highest man coverage rate in a single game all season. Some of that could have been the presence of Jarrett Stidham and the awful weather conditions in Denver, but the game plan worked. Stidham went 6-of-15 for 36 yards and a touchdown with one interception against man coverage in the 10-7 defeat.

Playing Smith-Njigba and the Seahawks is very different than facing Courtland Sutton and the Broncos. As good as Gonzalez can be at his best, I'm not sure I like anybody's chances of locking down Smith-Njigba one-on-one in man coverage for 60 minutes. And given how we've seen Smith-Njigba thrive at all levels this season, even one false step could be a house call. Heck, Gonzalez gave up a 52-yard completion to Marvin Mims Jr. in zone last time out on a snap when he was expecting a throw to the sticks and got something deeper.

What if there was a solution for this very problem and it involved New England's former coach? Belichick famously had a tactic to deal with the opposing team's top receiver. In this case, it would be known as 1 Double 11. The Patriots would bracket the opposing team's top wide receiver and play single-high safety coverage. The opposing offense would have one-on-one opportunities in man coverage elsewhere, and superstars still escape the brackets once in a while, but the tactic served to limit how effective the opposing team's best player could be in a critical game.

What made it even more effective is that Belichick didn't use his best cornerback in the bracket, instead preferring to use his second-best CB on the opposing team's top wideout, trusting that the safety help would more than compensate for the difference. Belichick would instead stick his star cornerback on the offense's second-best receiver, hoping that Revis or Gilmore could win that matchup one-on-one without any help over the top. So, spinning this forward to Sunday, the Pats would have Davis and a safety over the top on Smith-Njigba, while Gonzalez would be on Kupp or Shaheed.

If Belichick were in the game plan, we would be seeing 1 Double 11 on Sunday. He's not, so I'm not as sure. Vrabel and McDaniels worked under Belichick as player and assistant, respectively, but Kuhr and Williams did not. Gonzalez played under Belichick two years ago, but Davis wasn't part of that team. The Patriots might be able to install this coverage in two weeks, but they might not trust their ability to reliably run it in key spots without running it during the regular season.

With that being said, there also are ways to bracket the opposing team's top wideout with explicitly relying on Belichick's form of the coverage. The Patriots will have to seriously consider doubling Smith-Njigba and hoping that their cornerbacks can hold up. And the Seahawks will do what they can to avoid those double-teams. Kubiak has lined up Smith-Njigba in the slot for 24% of his routes during the postseason, where he would likely see slot corner Marcus Jones. Kubiak even lined up Smith-Njigba in the backfield for a touchdown against the Rams on a play Chris Shula's defense clearly wasn't expecting. This cat-and-mouse game will go on for 60 minutes, and both sides will have looks they haven't shown on tape pop up in key spots on Sunday.

Can the Patriots win with their blitz?

Regardless of whether you consider this recent version of the Patriots' defense to be the real one, we need to look at how it is different from the one we saw during the regular season. On the field, the difference would be having Milton Williams, who was on injured reserve for a chunk of the second half. Williams would have finished 10th among defensive tackles in pass rush win rate if he had played enough snaps to qualify. There's no doubt the Patriots are better with him on the field, although I'm not sure he's enough to make me believe they're a redux of the 2000 Ravens.

Schematically, though, Kuhr has made a meaningful change to the defense. Since Week 9, the Patriots have been the second-most blitz-happy defense in the NFL. Outside of one game against Cincinnati, when they blitzed just 10.5% of the time, the Patriots have blitzed on at least 30% of the opposing team's dropbacks in every game over that span. Overall, the Pats have blitzed 35.1% of the time over that stretch, a figure topped only by the Vikings, who sent extra rushers on a whopping 51% of dropbacks.

Has the blitz driven New England's success? Yes, but not in the way you would expect. Everyone's going to get more pressure when they blitz, but the Patriots actually rank fifth in pressure rate when they send four rushers or less, a figure that drops to 15th when they send five or more. The Pats generate a 5.8% sack rate when they blitz, which is only 23rd in the league.

Instead, the blitz has helped the Patriots force incompletions and limit opponents to short completions. Opposing quarterbacks average 6.1 yards per attempt against the Patriots when they don't blitz, but that figure drops to an NFL-low 4.3 yards per attempt when they do send extra pressure. The Pats have posted a 67.5% success rate when they've blitzed on defense since Week 9, the best mark of any defense. That number has stayed consistent throughout the postseason, with New England succeeding on 67.3% of its blitzes.

Injuries might again dictate how extensively the Patriots choose to lean into the blitz. Edge rusher Harold Landry III, another offseason addition, has been dealing with a knee injury for most of the season. He left the win over the Texans after just 11 snaps and didn't play in the AFC Championship Game. K'Lavon Chaisson has had a career campaign and has continued to make plays, but Landry is the Pats' best pure edge rusher. If Landry isn't available or can play only a limited menu of snaps, the Patriots might need to blitz more often to create a steady pass rush. And if they do, expect them to play more man coverage behind those blitzes.

The Seahawks were ninth in the NFL in success rate against the blitz during the regular season and 12th in EPA per play. As with so many other factors in this game, a heavy Patriots blitz package creates a higher-variance scenario for both teams and the potential for explosive plays on either side. Five of the eight turnovers the Patriots have forced this postseason have come on blitzes. If New England can't stop the Seahawks' offense, leaning into the blitz might be the best way to try to create field-flipping plays on defense and get the short fields it'll need to get back in the game.

The weak link to target

After a 2025 season in which Seahawks fans repeatedly rued the state of their offensive line, GM Schneider resisted the urge to make wholesale changes. He used a first-round pick on guard Grey Zabel, who has been very good in his rookie campaign, but the real shift came within the scheme. Moving from Ryan Grubb's five-out scheme to a Kubiak offense that moves the launch point and manipulates pass rushers with eye candy and the play-action game has made life easier for Seattle's offensive linemen.

There's still an obvious place for the Patriots to attack, though. Right guard Anthony Bradford allowed a team-high 13 quick pressures this season. Pass rushers have repeatedly given him trouble when they've worked Bradford's outside shoulder and gone around him. There also have been a number of plays when he has simply made a mental mistake and blocked the wrong guy in pass protection, although Darnold has had a habit of overcoming those free rushers to find Smith-Njigba for completions anyway.

One weak link offensive lineman can swing a Super Bowl. The Chiefs didn't have a real left tackle last year, and while Joe Thuney did his best, the star guard was overmatched against the Eagles. The Chiefs tried to help their tackles with chips, but that just kept their receivers from getting into their routes, leaving Patrick Mahomes as a sitting duck in the pocket.

In a more direct scenario, the 49ers were forced to insert Spencer Burford for an injured Jon Feliciano in the previous season's Super Bowl, and the young guard blocked the wrong guy on a crucial third-down snap in overtime, allowing Chris Jones a completely free run at Brock Purdy, who never got a chance to see his open receivers on the play. What could have been a touchdown turned into a field goal, and the Chiefs took the ball on the next possession and marched down the field for a championship-winning TD.

On the other hand, a weak spot in the lineup doesn't always sink your chances. Before Super Bowl LV, one of the talking points was Buccaneers guard Aaron Stinnie, who had never started an NFL game before taking over for an injured Alex Cappa in the wild-card round. It was easy to imagine a scenario in which Jones ran over Stinnie in a Chiefs victory. But the Bucs got out to a 14-3 lead, repeatedly harassed Mahomes behind an injury-hit Chiefs line and never looked back. Stinnie spent most of the game run blocking with a big lead.

Game situation matters. If the Seahawks get ahead and can protect the football, Bradford is unlikely to be exposed. If they fall behind or need to throw in key spots to win the game, expect the Patriots to target the third-year pro with their rush schemes. They can twist defenders toward Bradford and force him to stay aware and communicate with his fellow linemen. They also might line up in five-man fronts, force the Seahawks to declare one-on-one blocks across the board and get Williams or Christian Barmore matched up against Bradford without any help. If the Seahawks are playing from ahead, though, they'd be able to lean into the play-action game and avoid putting Bradford on an island in obvious dropback pass situations.

If Seattle can run its way out of those third-and-long situations, it might not need much from Darnold to win, in general. The run game improved over the second half of the season as the Seahawks started to generate more explosives, but without Charbonnet, Kenneth Walker III struggled in the NFC title game. Including the playoffs, the Seahawks rank 15th in EPA per play and 21st in success rate on designed runs.

Again, it might be too much to ask for the Seahawks to generate consistent success against a stout Patriots front that ranked in the top 10 in EPA per rush snap when Williams was in the lineup, but this game isn't going to be built around consistent success. If Walker (or backup George Holani, who played 35% of the snaps against the Rams in Charbonnet's absence) can manage a 30-yard run and pick up a few first downs in short yardage, that might be enough to qualify as a good day on the ground for Seattle, even if the final yards-per-carry mark isn't all that impressive.

The truly special teams

The Seahawks might not be here without the league's best special teams unit. Rashid Shaheed has been a revelation as a return man since joining the team in a midseason trade from the Saints, and his punt return for a touchdown helped spark the December comeback against the Rams that spurred the Seahawks to the NFC West crown and home-field advantage throughout the conference's bracket. Recovering Xavier Smith's muffed punt for a short field and a touchdown might have been the deciding factor in the NFC Championship Game too.

Seattle has had a significant special teams advantage over just about everybody it has faced, and that will mostly continue to be true against the Patriots. Vrabel's team does have an elite punt returner in Marcus Jones, who took two kicks to the house this season. The Pats have cycled through various kick returners to replace the injured Antonio Gibson. It remains to be seen whether they'll use TreVeyon Henderson on kickoff returns in the Super Bowl, given that the rookie's role on offense has been marginalized in recent weeks. The second-round pick produced a 100-yard kickoff return for a score in the preseason, but he hasn't returned a kick since Week 8.

The issue for the Patriots will come when they kick to Shaheed. They ranked 23rd in EPA per kickoff and 30th in EPA per punt this season. The Seahawks, meanwhile, led the league in EPA on kickoffs. Seattle's Michael Dickson ranked second in the league in Puntalytics' ranking of punter performance, which focuses more on the punter than team coverage. Bryce Baringer of the Patriots was 25th by the same metric, and he struggled badly in the Denver weather.

Likewise, the Seahawks have an advantage on scoring kicks. Seattle's Jason Myers hit only 85.4% of his field goal attempts in the regular season, but facing a more difficult set of opportunities than the average kicker, his expected field goal conversion rate per Next Gen Stats was just 76.7%. Myers was 8.7% over expectation, which ranked 14th among kickers with 20 attempts or more. Pats rookie Andy Borregales hit a kick to win the game against the Bills, but he had one of the highest expected success rates in the league and finished with the fifth-worst field goal points per game over expected of any kicker. He also missed two kicks against the Broncos, although one of them was a 63-yarder, while the other was a 46-yard boot as conditions worsened just before the start of the fourth quarter.

Can Vrabel manage his way to a victory?

If there is one place the Patriots have a decided advantage, though, it's in game management. Macdonald has been better as the season has gone along, but he had a markedly conservative streak during the regular season. The Seahawks went for it just 17.6% of the time on fourth down on the offensive side of the field, the lowest rate of any team in the NFL. Macdonald got more comfortable going for it on fourth-and-1 when AJ Barner proved himself to be a viable tush push sneaker, but the Seahawks were one of the more conservative operations in the league.

Vrabel, meanwhile, cost his team less win probability this season than any other coach besides Carroll on fourth downs (and that's partly because his Raiders weren't in position to win many games regardless of what they did on fourth down). Vrabel has been aggressive throughout the campaign, including during the playoffs, where the Patriots picked up a critical touchdown on a fourth-and-1 call against the Texans. The Pats also converted a fourth-and-1 in the third quarter against Denver as they drove for the game-winning field goal, although that decision has curiously flown under the radar in the postgame analysis of Sean Payton's choice to go for it on fourth-and-short in the first half.

Vrabel also gained another more subtle advantage. Defenses are afforded the opportunity to substitute after the offense makes personnel changes, and it's fair to say that Vrabel has encouraged his players to take their time as they come on and off the field. Vrabel's substitutions nearly wound the play clock down against the Broncos, both killing time off the running game clock and forcing the Broncos to hurriedly snap the ball to avoid a penalty, leading to a Jarrett Stidham interception.

The AFC title game wasn't the first time Vrabel has encouraged his substitutes to ponder existence and soak in the adoration of the crowd as they waltz off the field, but it was a reminder of how the former linebacker has found ways to exploit loopholes in the league's rules to manipulate the clock in his favor. Titans fans will remember Vrabel taking deliberate penalties before a punt to run down the clock in the fourth quarter of their playoff win over the Patriots, infuriating Belichick (who used the same tactic earlier that 2019 season) on the opposing sideline.

I suspect the league noticed Vrabel's tactic and quietly told him it won't be so patient with New England's substitutions in the Super Bowl. Don't be surprised, though, if Vrabel and McDaniels (who helped run the previously unseen unbalanced line/substitution trick that fueled a Patriots playoff win over the Ravens) have another wrinkle or tactical ploy in their arsenal saved for the Super Bowl. No better time to use it than now.

My pick: Seahawks 20, Patriots 13

After taking a closer look, my strongest feeling about this game is that the offenses won't play very well. The Seahawks are too dominant on the defensive side of the ball, and the Patriots have been much improved there over the past month. I wouldn't be surprised if both teams leaned into their run games to try to take some of the pressure off their respective quarterbacks, and that could lead to plenty of punts while each team tries to find an opportunity for an explosive play.

There's a chance we get a high-scoring game, but I would expect that to come from the offenses being handed short fields by their defenses and special teams as opposed to some form of shootout. Then again, we know both of these teams can hit shots downfield, so if the Seahawks get out to an early lead, the Patriots might have no choice but to air it out to get back into the contest.

        <hr/>
        Even before Marty Walsh took the job as head of the NHL Players’ Association, he started to hear the same refrain.

In interviews for the job, he’d ask players about their priorities. Get us back into best-on-best competition and back into the Olympics, he was told.

After skipping the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, the NHL had come close to a return in 2022. Contracts were signed, the league’s calendar included a long break in February for players to go to Beijing. The pandemic, and subsequent restrictions on athletes who traveled to China for the Olympics, caused the league to pull out in December 2021.

By the time Walsh was named head of the NHLPA in March 2023, there was no pandemic to worry about. So the conversation quickly got serious about 2026.

After more than a decade without NHL players going to the Olympics, and with an entire generation of the league’s best players never given the opportunity to play in any kind of best-on-best competition, there was broad agreement that something had to give.

“There was never really a negotiation with the NHL,” Walsh told The Post. “It was basically right out the gate, mutually agreed upon that we want to get NHL players back into the Olympics, from Day 1, pretty much.”

It is, of course, one thing to be on the same page about wanting to go to the Olympics, and another thing entirely to make it happen.

On the NHL side, the Olympics come with a particular stumbling block. If they allow their players to go, it is, essentially, the highest-profile hockey event in the world, and the league itself has no control over it and cannot profit off it, at least not directly.

“We have to disappear for two weeks at the height of our season,” commissioner Gary Bettman told The Post. “Which means content for the website, for dot-com, for the radio station, for social media, from us, disappears to a large extent, because we don’t get [intellectual property] rights from the IOC.

“We have to have a compressed schedule. We have to take into account that NHL teams send various amounts of players to the Olympics. Teams like Tampa and the Panthers send 10 players each and we’ve got some teams sending one or two players. Teams are gonna come back in a different place in terms of how they are than when we left. The fact of the matter is, some teams are gonna have a good chunk of their roster a little more tired and banged up.”

Those concerns were shelved during negotiations with the IOC and IIHF for a few reasons.

First, the agreement to go to the Olympics also came with the agreement to hold the 4 Nations Face-Off and, starting in 2028, the World Cup of Hockey. That is a win-win: Players are more than happy to get more opportunities to play best-on-best, and judging by the rousing success of the 4 Nations last season, the World Cup — over which the league and players association have joint control — will be a ratings bonanza and cash cow.

“I think having this consistent schedule moving forward is gonna change the dynamics as far as the fan experience,” Walsh said. “I’m from Boston, I hear it all the time: Is there gonna be another 4 Nations? I try to explain to people, we have a World Cup of Hockey. … I think it’s important for us that people want to see this tournament, make it exciting. That [growth] will be measured at some point; I don’t think you can measure it yet.”

Second, going back to the Olympics was a major priority for the players. It helped, too, that Walsh, unlike certain predecessors, established a strong relationship with Bettman early and the league also recognized that, though the Olympics stood to benefit most from their presence, being there would help grow the game.

Third, negotiations with the IOC and IIHF went well. Costs such as transportation and insurance — the latter of which has turned into an ongoing issue at the World Baseball Classic — needed to be shouldered by those parties. Medical standards identical to the NHL’s were also incorporated.

“Certainly, we weren’t going to pay for the privilege of shutting down,” Bettman said.

The IOC agreed to write the check, so that hurdle was cleared.

“What was not on the list [of issues],” Walsh said, “was the ice. Know what I mean?”

The last hurdle

The first thing that needs to be said about the Santagiulia Arena in Milan is that it is expected to be complete, or, better put, complete enough to stage a competition.

That such a thing was recently in question, though, is a problem unto itself. And if not for the determination of the players, who have taken an attitude that they will play in the Olympics come hell or high water, it’s certainly possible that the state of the arena would be threatening the tournament at large.

The Santagiulia Arena, which will stage most of the men’s games and both the men’s and women’s gold medal games, will have a capacity of approximately 3,000 fewer seats than planned because of construction issues.

Construction of 14 dressing rooms is coming down to the wire, the luxury suites are unfinished, the dimensions of the ice are off by a few feet, the first test event wasn’t held until just a few weeks ago and featured a stoppage of play due to a hole in the ice. The practice rink, which is adjacent to the game rink, has been slow to complete too, though The Post was told last week that it is on schedule.

The good news, relatively speaking, is that the hole in the ice is baked into the expectations for the first game on a new sheet of ice, and not quite as alarming as it sounds. The bad news is, well, pretty much everything else. The ice may be playable, but that is different from the ice being good.

“I was disappointed that the arena wasn’t as much of a priority as we had hoped,” Bettman said. “That they [hadn’t] begun building it sooner, so this wasn’t a bit of a fire drill down the end.”

The NHL and the NHLPA have both tried to keep things diplomatic regarding a situation that will at best narrowly avoid being a total embarrassment. But when Walsh and Bettman spoke to The Post in mid-January, their frustration was obvious.

“I just think when you’re building something like this for the Olympics, I would have thought a sense of urgency would have settled in a lot earlier, where you would have this thing done,” Walsh said. “… You’re talking about the world coming to your city and your country, you would hope that the arena would have been looking — not actually world class — but complete.

“From what I understand, they’re working around the clock now. They just started to work around the clock. Quite honestly, they should’ve been working around the clock all along. If it was coming to my city and I was in charge, I’d say let’s get this thing done.”

The NHL’s agreement with the IOC includes the 2030 Games, where hockey will be played in the Stade de Nice in France — a venue that already exists as a soccer stadium, but which will need to be fitted for hockey and divided into two indoor arenas.

The hope is that Kirsty Coventry, who was appointed head of the IOC last year and thus is not taking the brunt of the blame for the current situation, prevents something similar from happening four years from now.

“My expectation is that they learned from the experience,” Bettman said. “And hopefully we won’t see a repetition of it.”

Russia, Russia, Russia

Another point of contention in this return to best-on-best competition: the exclusion of Team Russia, which has been expelled from international competition due to the country’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

That decision — as regards both the Olympics and the 2028 World Cup of Hockey — is essentially out of the NHL’s and PA’s hands, and perhaps even the IOC’s.

First and foremost, the political echelon in European countries would need to be comfortable with the idea of their national teams playing on the same sheet of ice as Russia’s, an inherently uncomfortable thought given the propaganda value of sport. That question might even supersede those involving ongoing ceasefire negotiations, or the Trump administration’s relative warmth toward Vladimir Putin.

“I wouldn’t isolate the United States because of what’s going on here with the president and his relationship, or lack thereof, with Putin,” said Walsh, who was secretary of labor under Joe Biden when Russian soldiers began marching toward Kyiv. “Nobody’s said to us, ‘Let the Russians play,’ as far as political leadership. It’s a world issue and I think it has to be resolved on a world stage.

“I don’t think Canada and the United States can even begin to open the door here. It really has to be Europe.”

It’s little secret that Russian players want to participate, though most have refrained from commenting on the geopolitical situation, in large part because doing so could affect their families at home.

The IIHF and IOC have signaled openness to allowing Russian and Belarussian athletes at the youth level to play starting in 2028.

“That’s entirely their call,” Bettman said.

Drop the puck

Once the tournament begins with Slovakia facing Finland next Wednesday, though, it’s a safe bet that all the concerns will be relegated to the back burner.

If the hockey is good, then a global TV audience won’t care much about whether the luxury suites in the arena are complete, or even if the ice is as good as it could be.

It will be about hockey, Olympic best-on-best hockey, and the stage which produced Sidney Crosby’s golden goal, T.J. Oshie’s shootout heroics, Dominik Hasek carrying Czechia to gold, and the Miracle on Ice will have the spotlight shining on it again.

“I think there’s nothing, in any sport, that compares to our best-on-best,” Bettman said. “The energy, the excitement, the passion, the skill that our players bring to the game is extraordinary.”

Indeed, as the date has grown closer, the excitement to get to Italy has grown palpable in NHL circles. The players, after all, have waited 12 years for this.

“I think everyone’s just chomping at the bit,” Team USA winger Kyle Connor told The Post. “The intensity, the buzz, the awareness of what the 4 Nations brought, now to take that to the scale of the Olympics. As a player, just thrilled to be able to involve more countries as well.

“Just do best-on-best hockey. It’s what you want as a competitor.”

        This article appears in the February 2026 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Read more from the issue.

Washington, D.C., has a higher median income than any state in the union, and yet I never really felt destitute until a rainy Sunday morning last May, when I booked my youngest kid’s seventh birthday party at the St. James, a sprawling luxury sports complex about half the size of Reagan National Airport, some 12 miles west of the Potomac River. At 8:30 a.m., not only was every space in the parking lot full, but every adjacent square inch of pedestrian walkway and grassy median strip was occupied by Rivians and BMW X3s. Adjacent the trampolines and the Ninja Warrior course, swarms of parents and grandmothers in $700 raincoats and $7,000 watches waited to stampede into assigned private rooms for their designated 90-minute play windows, while staffers set up pancake stations and $20-a-head taco buffets.

“Oh, it’s no problem, we’re here four nights a week so we’re used to it,” one of my son’s classmate’s dads replied when I apologized for the Darwinian parking situation. “Gymnastics, swimming, ice skating, and lacrosse.” Sounds like a second mortgage payment!, I marveled, as the dad, a small-restaurant owner whose daughter is easily two or three years ahead of her classmates in reading and math, gave the resigned laugh of someone who definitely did not have an extra mortgage payment to spare. “It’s not cheap!”

He wasn’t alone. Strolling the hallways afterward, I realized there were hundreds, very likely thousands, of parents who veritably lived at the St. James, tapping away in noise-canceling headphones while their children partook of indoor batting cages and futsal fields, squash courts and basketball courts, climbing walls and diving boards and multiple NHL-sized hockey rinks with ingeniously designed raised viewing concourses, seemingly designed to feel like VIP box seating. Someone, I thought to myself, is getting so fucking rich off this place.

Steve Griffin experienced a similar epiphany nearly 15 years ago, when his 12-year-old son was beginning to display unusual talent for baseball. Somewhat by accident, Griffin is today one of America’s foremost experts on the financialization of youth sports, and he shared copious insights into the business practices of the private equity billionaire who bankrolled the St. James, to which I will return. But back in 2012, he was just one of those naïve middle-aged white guys who dared to wonder if he could somehow avoid becoming Detached Irritable Workaholic Dad and make money doing something fun, something that might even impress his kids.

GRIFFIN, A NO-NONSENSE CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT with an acutely honed bullshit detector and a native New Englander’s hardwired contempt for new-money extravagance, was a consultant who had honed a reputation as “the guy who got the call when something was going wrong at a portfolio company.” Then as now, America was swimming in newly minted billionaires, mostly men who had made so much money managing other people’s money they needed to hire other people to manage their own money. In his telling, he self-deprecatingly described his role as a “financial janitor.”

Griffin’s son’s team had missed its chance to go to the Little League World Series in Williamsport. But he got something else: a weeklong youth baseball tournament in Cooperstown, New York, where a man named Lou Presutti had built 22 baseball stadiums designed to draw tourists to the nearby MLB Hall of Fame. A few days later, someone affiliated with an outfit called Perfect Game, who had apparently been watching the games, called Griffin and suggested Griffin’s son come down to Jupiter, Florida, for an invitation-only baseball development program. “My jaw dropped,” Griffin told me. “There were hundreds of golf carts running around this massive sports complex, with college coaches driving from field to field to field to watch the next superstar.” Perfect Game played its tournaments in a stadium that was home to four minor league teams and spring training for the Miami Marlins and the St. Louis Cardinals—meaning Perfect Game did not have to purchase its own stadiums and make big capital expenditures, which appealed to Griffin’s fear of money-hole capital expenditures. “I thought, oh, this is an interesting business.”

He invested in Perfect Game, though he divested his stake a few years later when he got an even more promising opportunity: the chance to join one of the pre-eminent organizations in what would soon become a $40 billion youth sports industry.

The New Hampshire–based company was called Legacy Global Sports. Its charismatic founder/CEO John St. Pierre had a huge presence in two of the most demographically appealing youth sports—soccer and hockey—and an increasing foothold in the even faster-growing sport of lacrosse. On a good day, St. Pierre gave the impression he might be the John D. Rockefeller of youth sports.

Griffin thought this could be the kind of fun, profitable enterprise that could become a real juggernaut. So he invested in Legacy during its next fundraising round in 2017, which would be led by Jefferson River Capital, the family office of Hamilton “Tony” James, the chief operating officer of the largest private equity firm on Earth (Blackstone) and one of the best-connected men on Wall Street. Griffin joined the company as executive vice president of strategy, mergers, and acquisitions.

Yet within months, Griffin was suddenly told the company needed cash injections or Legacy might not make payroll. He was dumbfounded: One of the things he’d found most appealing about Legacy was that it owned no real estate or machinery of consequence, and customers paid for tournaments and summer camps well in advance. “The company should have been in a liquid position, but it wasn’t,” he said.

But Legacy’s finances were nothing like St. Pierre had suggested, as Griffin would later detail in a memoir. For starters, the company had been dramatically overstating its annual revenue on the basis of … vibes. The $100 million revenue figure they threw around was profoundly inflated, in part because some divisions of the company had substituted rosy forecasts and revenues for the real thing, Griffin claims. In reality, revenues were no greater than $55.1 million. None of the accounting systems of the dozen or so smaller companies Legacy had gobbled up had been integrated, and most months, Legacy didn’t even provide a full set of financial statements. Ultimately, Griffin would determine that “a business that we thought [generated] $8 million or so of EBITDA … was really not generating any free cash flow at all.” All this had gone undetected because prior investors never demanded a formal audit, he said.

Griffin began to work long hours to stop the bleeding. As he recalled in two books on his Legacy Global experience, a “novel” and subsequent follow-up memoir, sometimes he would even work all night. By late November 2018, the board had fired St. Pierre and installed Griffin as CEO to clean up the mess. This made him one of Legacy’s few employees who stayed in the office after business hours, which is how he first noticed a woman with bleach-blond hair and aggressive makeup who would sometimes arrive at the office as late as 6:00 and leave after nothing but a cigarette break. He was told she worked in accounts payable, had young children and a messy divorce, and to let it slide.

Within a year, the FBI came knocking at the door.

“HAND IN THE COOKIE JAR” SYNDROME has long beset youth sports; most leagues are still tax-exempt nonprofits, though that requires far more public disclosure than private equity. Every few weeks, a youth sports league official in some county or another is arrested for embezzling from angry parents; in 2019, a travel baseball team official in New Jersey was arrested for robbing a bank to repay $6,500 he’d stolen from his team. But as money and financial expertise has flooded the sector, the scams have gotten bigger and harder to prosecute. Last fall, USA Today documented a complex scheme uncovered by a volunteer hockey mom whereby Colorado youth hockey authorities were allegedly siphoning money into shell companies owned by the board chairman. USA Hockey eventually pushed the chairman and an associate out of their positions; the chairman was later found liable for civil theft, unjust enrichment, conversion, and breach of fiduciary duty, though that’s currently under appeal.

Such amateurism is an important part of private equity’s thesis of investment in youth sports properties, Griffin explained on a 2021 podcast appearance. Youth sports was “the Wild West,” Griffin said. “We thought there was an opportunity to come in, invest capital in a business that could serve as a platform across multiple sports, elevate the experiences for the consumer … [build] appropriate back office infrastructure to operate the business more efficiently … and simultaneously see a good investment financially … but also [better satisfy] a consumer that deserves more value.”

One model for this is Varsity Brands, a private equity–backed cheerleader-turned–monopolist that rolled up well over a dozen cheerleading camps and tournaments, uniform and equipment suppliers, and professional associations and sold it to Bain Capital for $2.5 billion. But as the world was just beginning to learn, the Varsity Brands success story was not about efficiencies or economies of scale: The company was in the early stages of a litigation tsunami stemming from alleged blatantly anti-competitive conduct and failure to police coach sexual abuse.

Griffin was also beginning to realize travel sports were not particularly “scalable.” The ratio of “customers” to coaches, referees, and field or rink hours is relatively immovable; subsidies, sponsorships, and apparel discounts are often easier to come by with a tax exemption and volunteer staff. Although “professionalizing” Legacy would prove an eye-opening intellectual journey, it also came at a cost: a lawsuit filed by St. Pierre against Griffin, Jefferson River Capital, and the board that fired him at the end of 2018 accused the private equity firm of ballooning overhead by $18 million from 2018 to 2019. (St. Pierre declined to comment for this story, citing the terms of the eventual lawsuit settlement.)

In Griffin’s defense, a seven-figure chunk of that increased overhead went to the various law firms and crisis advisories retained to grapple with the fallout of an FBI raid of the Legacy Global soccer division in October 2019, not long after the board voted to fire St. Pierre. It turned out that the division, which Legacy had acquired via a Boston-based company called Global Premier Soccer (GPS) in 2016, had been operating a massive labor trafficking scheme that dated back as far as 2012, and the Department of Homeland Security finally moved to shut it down.

GPS was the brainchild of two brothers from Northern Ireland with accents that seemed to grow more exaggerated among bigger crowds. The elder brother, Joe Bradley, had captained the Harvard soccer team and still nursed a bit of a chip on his shoulder from his formative years among the super-elite, but the combination of pedigree and brogue was the perfect balm for parents desperate to enroll their sons and daughters in extracurricular activities that might yield future status dividends.

In the early days, recruiting foreign coaches to run kids’ summer camps that might have been staffed by American teenagers was a marketing ploy. As American soccer star Alexi Lalas told The Guardian for a 2014 story on Bradley’s burgeoning empire: “US soccer is littered with decades of people coming over with little more than an accent to their resume, and using the naivete we’ve had and the inexperience and lack of soccer history and culture to their advantage.” But by that point, the naïveté of the coaches was a bigger problem than the soccer moms: twentysomething soccer fanatics in Barcelona and Belfast could easily be convinced that coaching suburban third graders in Brookline or Cape Cod was the opportunity of a lifetime.

Once in America, the coaches quickly learned that the opportunity was not so glowing. According to allegations in The Guardian and anonymous job sites like Glassdoor, GPS housed them in cramped apartments, forced them to work long hours, and paid them meager wages. Most insidiously, they were enlisted as part of a set of elaborate immigration schemes regarding the nature of their business in the United States.

“There were a lot of very sketchy practices with visas,” one British former Global Premier coach told The Boston Globe. “At the time, you’re not entirely sure it’s above-board, but you go with it anyway because you want a job.”

Different visas required different schemes. H-2B visas are for temporary jobs if a company doesn’t have enough U.S. citizens to fill roles—obviously not the case in youth coaching. But the most brazen lies governed the coveted P-1 visa, which entitled coaches to stay up to five years, so long as they could convince DHS they were actually being recruited to work as “talent scouts” for professional soccer teams. This required, in addition to a script reminding applicants “DO NOT TAKE YOUR GPS CONTRACT WITH YOU” to the embassy, the collusion of at least seven teams, including an indoor franchise then called the Syracuse Silver Knights and two women’s professional teams, the (now-defunct) Boston Breakers and (since-renamed) Sky Blue FC, the latter of which was co-owned by Goldman Sachs veteran Phil Murphy, who had been inaugurated as the governor of New Jersey just ten months before the raid. In reality, the coaches would not scout for the teams at all; they would just fan out across the country to work for GPS. The British coach told the Globe that he was instructed never to tell anyone that they were soccer coaches, even though that was their primary job.

The Breakers alone gave more than 70 scouting visas to GPS/Legacy coaches before the team folded in 2018; Sky Blue applied for at least 40. Griffin found multiple internal Sky Blue emails detailing the scheme to Murphy, who offered “good luck” to his team before a 2016 meeting to discuss the arrangement with an immigration attorney. Murphy, now out of office, did not respond to a request for comment.

GRIFFIN HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH EARLY-ONSET Parkinson’s disease after joining Legacy. When the company finally collapsed amid the COVID-19 shutdowns, his doctor convinced him to start journaling his ordeal, to “transfer the experience from the emotional half of my brain where trauma resides, to the intellectual half where catharsis happens.” For two months, he woke before dawn, brought his laptop to the beach, and typed out everything that had just happened. He changed all the names except those of his wife and children and self-published it as a “novel.” A portion of the proceeds went to the Michael J. Fox Foundation and the Positive Coaching Alliance, a nonprofit founded in the 1990s to “train” parents to behave less counterproductively during games, which has since broadened its mission to include grappling with the various crises plaguing youth sports.

St. Pierre’s wife sued him pro se for defamation; the case was dismissed. But in increasing volume, former Legacy and GPS employees, customers, coaches, and even coaches’ mothers contacted him, according to his memoir on the topic. One former coach told him GPS had a doctor who helped them falsify staff and players’ vaccine records. He also told him that coaches had to pay for the gasoline used in company-owned cars, submit receipts for reimbursement, and would receive only 75 percent of the expense.

One night, Griffin watched the movie Spotlight and realized something: He had read a 2015 newspaper article about the shutdown of a GPS sleepaway camp in Western Massachusetts following a bad health inspection. Among the infractions, the camp could not supply criminal or sex offender background checks. He realized that if coaches had been brought to the country illegally and steps had likely been taken to conceal their roles, it was very unlikely they would have been subjected to background screenings. Griffin looked into it. He found people brought into the country who were never screened, then found several of them had allegedly abused children. A few months later, Christy Holly, a longtime GPS coach, was fired as head coach for the Racing Louisville women’s soccer team following numerous allegations of inviting players to watch game footage with him, then groping them each time they “fucked up.” (The National Women’s Soccer League gave Holly a lifetime ban on coaching; he denied some, but not all, of the claims.)

Griffin kept spreadsheets, timelines, and detailed notes documenting all these new revelations in hopes it would prove useful to the Department of Justice investigation; all that happened was the COO pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit visa fraud and a single other employee pleaded guilty to destroying records in connection with this investigation.

Meanwhile, the youth sports gold rush continued apace. During the first two years of the pandemic, Murry Gunty, a private equity acquaintance of John St. Pierre and boss/owner of one of the three creditors who sued to force Legacy into Chapter 7 liquidation, more than doubled the physical size of his burgeoning mid-Atlantic hockey empire, variously known as Black Bear Sports and Blackstreet Capital Holdings. (In 2024, he acquired St. Pierre’s own ice arena in Exeter, New Hampshire, for an undisclosed sum.) A Massachusetts upstart called 3STEP Sports with funding from the Fertitta family scooped up about a dozen youth sports franchises, including Seacoast United, a regional league associated with the Bradley brothers. When Legacy folded, 3STEP’s founder David Geaslen could barely contain his enthusiasm. “I feel bad … for everyone who … will never see their money again,” he told The Boston Globe. “But every single kid who played for a Legacy program is going to be playing for somebody else.”

By 2025, the estimated annual revenue of the youth sports business had doubled from its pre-pandemic size to $40 billion, despite a modest decline from pre-pandemic participation levels. At the same time, any parent who could still afford to shell out a second mortgage payment for travel soccer/taekwondo/speed skating after COVID was more determined than ever to do so, because the specter of screen addiction was orders of magnitude more terrifying than the thought of not getting into a respectable college. Family spending on youth sports rose 46 percent from 2019 to 2024, and parents are running GoFundMe campaigns to get their kids to that Little League tournament in Cooperstown.

Thanks to the Legacy debacle, federal investigators began contacting Griffin for help demystifying financial frauds, all too many of which have involved youth sports. There was, for starters, a dubious deal to build a $284 million complex in Mesa, Arizona, called, of all things, “Legacy Sports Park.” A father-son minor league baseball duo had somehow convinced taxpayers to approve nearly $300 million in municipal bonds for the complex, then failed to generate enough cash to make a single interest payment. The developers claimed to have secured a ten-year lease with Manchester United, an iconic team that was most certainly not going to set down its first physical American roots in Mesa, Arizona. Griffin assisted in determining the lease provided to sell investors on the deal was a forgery. The owners pleaded guilty to fraud last year, and the complex was recently sold to a private equity–backed Philadelphia investor named Mike Burke for $25.5 million, or roughly one-tenth what it cost taxpayer-subsidized bond investors to build.

“The thing about fancy sports complexes,” Griffin told the Prospect, “is that they are exactly like stadiums: No matter how successful they are, they never seem to generate enough cash to cover the cost of building and maintaining them.” So the institutions involved in developing or controlling them need to get some sucker—ultimately, you and me—to shoulder that expense. Some, like Murry Gunty and Mike Burke, buy ice rinks on the cheap from county park authorities and recreation commissions, then torment customers with rent hikes and junk fees, like the up to $50 “streaming service” to which Gunty’s Black Bear Sports required parents (including a U.S. senator) to subscribe if they wanted to view video of their kids’ games, until called on it by The Lever.

This brings us to Todd Boehly, the multibillionaire MAGA donor and fellow Miamian who co-owns Chelsea FC, the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Los Angeles Lakers, and the awe-inspiring St. James Sports & Wellness Complex, to which I shelled out a grand or so on my kid’s birthday party. Boehly pioneered the fine art of using insurance premiums to fund risky private equity investments at Guggenheim Partners; now he controls a $74 billion annuity and structured settlement empire called Eldridge Industries that he can leverage to finance boyhood retirement fantasy purchases, only by virtue of the fact that Eldridge has walked up to the line of state insurance regulations. (Boehly did not respond to request for comment.)

There already may be signs not all is financially well at the imposing St. James: Another private equity–backed youth sports conglomerate, Total Package Hockey (TPH) Academy, recently sued it for breach of contract and poaching one of its executives to be the “chief academic officer” of the new online school the complex is now offering to child athletes too serious about sports to attend traditional school, a business model that is for some reason all the rage in the youth sports business. A glance at the TPH website promises that student athletes will log in to daily lectures on “Defining What It Means to Be a Great Teammate” and “The 9 Core TPH Way Principles for Aspiring Elite Student-Athletes” while becoming “holistically connected in the TPH Performance App, a tool that allows for wellness, commitment, and performance to be tangible and measurable,” while also hearing from frequent guest speakers “across a range of disciplines (sports, business, leadership)” and even gaining access to extracurricular activities “such as investment club or public speaking skills development.”

It’s almost enough to make you pine for the days when the purpose of travel sports was supposed to be a college education, or even the joy of the game.

        <hr/>
        On the day that Nico Harrison traded Luka Doncic for a package built around Anthony Davis, he doomed AD to a public, ongoing humiliation. The deal itself was a laughingstock. No move of its kind in NBA history has been so obviously misguided, so clearly without even the most basic defense. It stacked terrible judgment on poor basketball philosophy and inexplicable process. And Davis, through no real fault of his own, came to represent it all. His tenure with the Dallas Mavericks was cursed from the start. Once the trade failed—and it could only fail—that disaster was always bound to compound in another move for even less value. Harrison didn’t even keep his job long enough to see those failures through, but the Mavericks trudged toward them all the same before finally accepting the inevitable.

Dallas traded Davis to the Washington Wizards in the lead-up to Thursday’s trade deadline and did it without getting back a single star, blue-chip prospect, or highly coveted draft pick in return. The deal was an acknowledgment of a franchise-crippling blunder that never should have happened in the first place. It was also one more indignity, seeing as the Mavs—in the updated accounting—effectively sold out Doncic for Max Christie, an expiring Khris Middleton, two long-shot prospects one Marvin Bagley, three not very good first-round picks, and three seconds.

It’s sobering to see how little Davis fetched on the open market just a year after the Mavericks blew up a Finals team to acquire him. But Dallas had to do this—not this trade, exactly, but something like it. The Mavericks were never an Anthony Davis team, and any chance they had to become one fell away when they ping-ponged into drafting Cooper Flagg. The past nine months have seen the franchise gradually coming to terms with that fact. Wednesday’s trade doesn’t right any wrongs, but it at least shows that the Mavs finally have their priorities straight. The only timeline that matters now is Flagg’s. As he goes, they go. As he develops, they develop.

Frankly, Flagg has already been so remarkable as to make a blockbuster decision like this a bit easier. There’s no need to force the best thing the Mavericks have going into a veteran-driven formula—particularly when that formula relied so heavily on Davis, who missed almost two-thirds of the games during his Dallas tenure, and Kyrie Irving, who hasn’t played a game in almost a year. That version of the Mavericks was a wish. What Flagg is doing is real. When a 19-year-old is already playing like a star, just about everything else is secondary.

In a perfect world, Dallas could embrace a full-scale rebuild around Flagg, Christie, and Dereck Lively II (who underwent season-ending foot surgery in December). In the messier reality, the Mavs will likely still walk some middle path. Even if Matt Riccardi and Michael Finley (who are co-running the team on an interim basis) tore this roster down to the studs, no amount of cost cutting and liquidation would change the fact that after 2026, the Mavs won’t have control of their first-round draft picks for the next four years. Dallas was good enough to risk its future picks while trying to contend, and foolish enough to trade away the reason it was good enough to make those gambles in the first place. Given the circumstances, bringing back even two first-rounders in the trade for Davis—underwhelming as those picks ar —feels meaningful. Dallas needs the means to add more young talent, clearly, but also the assets to maneuver. First-round picks open doors. They give a team the currency to clear salary, work the angles in negotiation, or widen the scope of a trade. The Mavericks may not have control of their own tanking destiny, but any future firsts at all could facilitate movement for what was one of the most logjammed teams in the league. Dallas had an expensive roster bound for the play-in at best, bereft of draft capital. Trading Davis may not have fetched an amazing return, but it materially changed the Mavericks’ circumstances nonetheless.

Dallas no longer has to worry about when Davis might return to the floor after suffering ligament damage in his hand. It doesn’t have to make peace with those sorts of injuries while working out the details of an extension that could easily pay Davis upward of $60 million a season. The Mavs were a lottery-bound team staring down the second apron, which in this salary cap environment amounts to a death sentence. Trading Davis gave them a way out, or at least the start of one. Cleaning up the rest of the roster will take patience, savvy, and, more than anything: time.

That’s a luxury a team with Davis, who will turn 33 next month, can’t really afford. Washington has clearly leaned into a sense of urgency by trading for both Davis and Trae Young, declaring its intentions to compete for a playoff spot as soon as next season. It also now has one of the most expensive rosters in the league. Davis is a tremendous player who covers ground and disrupts plays on defense with the best of them—when healthy. That caveat just weighs more heavily with every passing season, as AD’s injuries mount and his salary continues to climb. The combination of the two is prohibitive enough that only a small subset of teams could talk themselves into absorbing Davis’s deal and all that comes with it. The market is what it is, as Dallas can attest. Washington just has enough emerging talent on rookie-scale contracts to at least try to think about the finances a bit differently.

With that comes a fresh start for Davis and the Mavericks both. So long as he stayed in Dallas, AD would have been tied to the bleakest moment in franchise history, his every accomplishment held up to Luka’s standard. And so long as Davis was around, the Mavericks would be burdened by the circumstances of his arrival and everything it cost. This move is a mercy for a team and a star that were drowning in context. It might not feel like the most inspiring trade package in the moment, but this move is about anything but today. The future? Sure. The past? Absolutely. This is what moving on looks like. The real return is letting go.

        Editor's note: Last week our fellow, Ella Markianos, pitched me on a novel experiment: attempting to use AI tools to do as much of her job as possible, and writing about the results. As her editor I can say with confidence that Ella is irreplaceable, and her job is hers as long as she wants it. Still, like Ella, I was curious what her investigation would find. Today, we publish her report. — Casey

As a young AI journalist, I spend a lot of time following the workers whose jobs are threatened by AI: recent CS grads, writers, people in entry-level roles. The ongoing collapse of the journalism business, highlighted by this week’s terrible cuts at the Washington Post, only serves to make those fears more acute.

As it so happens, I myself am a recent computer science grad in an entry-level writing role. And while we don’t yet have robots that can do on-the-ground reporting, large language models are becoming increasingly proficient at many of the tasks I am assigned each week.

One of my core responsibilities at Platformer is among the most computer-based tasks you can imagine. Along with my colleague Lindsey Choo, I write our Following section. In Following, we explain a news story and share what prominent people are saying about it on the internet.

I’ve long been worried that AI could upend the career in journalism that I’ve only just begun. My doubts are severe enough that I’ve spent hours wondering whether I should be pivoting toward my other skills. My totally irreplaceable skills, like… coding.

And so I did what anyone would do in my situation: size up my competition. I spent 20 hours building and customizing a Claude-based AI journalism agent that I named “Claudella” and the next several days investigating how well it could do my job.

Staying up until 6AM making frantic adjustments to Claudella, I discovered the strange allure of vibe coding your own replacement. I built a system that integrates pretty smoothly with all the apps Platformer uses to work and imitates my writing voice surprisingly well. And I oscillated between being heartened by Claudella’s dumb mistakes and genuinely scared that Claudella could do my job.

I was surprised how much my results improved after I made a concerted effort to give Claudella good instructions about how I work.

That included basics like attaching a style guide and extensive examples of the writing I wanted. It also included finicky fixes for helping my fledgling agent’s challenged search abilities.

By the end, I was surprised by how accurate Claudella’s work was, and how close its conclusions came to my own judgments.

It couldn’t write a one-liner to save its life. But it was ready for action.

Claudella’s first day at work

I wired up Claudella to shadow me on our work Discord. On day one, I gave it the same assignment I got from my editor.

Claudella was a bit coy about her potential to replace me. But it took to the job quickly, instantly taking on her new assignment.

Claudella’s turnaround rate was a lot faster than mine, although it tended towards two minutes instead of the 30 to 60 seconds that it promised Casey when he asked (rude).

Unfortunately, Claudella’s first assignment went south quickly. For one thing, the bot failed to realize that I’d already sent it a PDF it was asking for. For another, it immediately ran out of Anthropic API credits and refused to continue working until we rectified the situation.

I forked over the cash for some additional API credits. But Claudella’s second draft was also a dud, thanks to a random technical issue.

We organize the links in each edition of Platformer in a Notion database, and mark them as “used” once they have made it into a draft. Claudella skipped over the used links when writing news briefs, causing it to miss important information. I know to use all the relevant links, but my fledgling agent wasn’t equipped to do that.

By the third draft, though, Claudella was turning heads. Lindsey reported that she was surprised by how well my creation did our job. And despite a few errors, I was pretty happy with Claudella’s work myself. The bot wisely agreed with me that many “AI-related” layoffs were just spin from CEOs looking for cover, and it found some relevant X posts I hadn’t managed to find myself.

Claudella’s second day at work

After a solid first day, I decided it was time for Claudella to try its hand at a storied benchmark in the history of AI: the Turing test.

I would present two versions of Platformer’s Following section for the day to Casey: one, the genuine human-written piece that would go in the newsletter; the other, an AI counterfeit. I asked Casey to guess which was which. Thankfully, this time Claudella’s first draft was good enough to submit for consideration.

I turned in Lindsey's and my painstaking creation, “Elon consolidates the X empire,” alongside Claudella’s rapidly generated effort, “Musk’s $1.25 trillion mega-merger.”

There were no glaring hallmarks of AI writing in the latter: nary a “you’re absolutely right” was in sight, and Claudella’s use of em dashes was no more egregious than mine. As the moment of judgment arrived, I wondered if there was anything that would give away the AI authorship — or if I really might be cooked.

As it turns out, I needn’t have worried.

This time, I think the real giveaway was our “Why we’re following” subsection, where we collect online commentary. Despite me feeding Claudella a bunch of examples from previous editions, the model drifted toward a very sincere and verbose style, adding lots of unnecessary detail. (I tend to go more concise and sarcastic.)

I wrote three sentences for my version, and Claudella wrote seven. My ending line had been, “We hope he will use his power wisely (as he has failed to do in the past).” Claudella’s was “Meanwhile, xAI is facing a host of new regulatory probes, including by authorities in Europe, India, Australia and California, after its Grok AI tools enabled users to easily generate and share sexualized images of children and non-consensual intimate images of adults.”

The earliest version of Claudella would often hallucinate; I fixed that by adding very strict sourcing instructions to my prompts. But the new version would sometimes link to an article that didn’t support its (true) claims. That’s the sort of error that editors find annoying to track down and fix.

What a bot can't do

I could view the Claudella experiment through the lens of human exceptionalism and say that my bot is missing the style and humor that can only spring forth from the human soul. I might say that it occasionally hallucinates because it lacks “real intelligence.” But I think a lot of what's missing will simply be fixed by improvements in what the AI companies call “instruction following.”

I saw a version of this myself. Claudella improved significantly after I gave it examples and a step-by-step guide to catch the errors it was making. The process was not unlike the mentoring I receive when Casey and I talk about my writing. But because I’m working with a text-based language model, Claudella always needs written instructions.

Unfortunately, at a certain point too many instructions make the system start behaving erratically. It gets confused by my micromanaging. For example, I wanted Claudella to evaluate our commentary roundup for length, shortening it if there weren’t any particularly juicy posts that day. But when I explicitly asked for concision, the model got confused and forgot to write the roundup section altogether.

This could make me hesitant to give Claudella the feedback it dearly needed — that it was being too serious and too wordy for the task at hand. In those cases I said nothing, because I didn’t want to upset the rickety pile of sticks that held my fledgling AI journalism agent together.

Properly solving these issues might require AIs to do “continual learning” analogous to the way humans do — receiving regular feedback and incorporating it into how they work.

Although continual learning is currently a major focus for AI researchers, I suspect many shortcomings will be patched just by improving AIs’ ability to process more written instructions.

Which brings us to today.

Claudella 4.6

Fortunately, I had a perfect opportunity to see how a change in AI capabilities would affect the AI’s ability to do my job: Anthropic released an update to Claude this morning. I decided to test my original agentic setup with the new model.

My first test was of the new model’s sense of humor. Asked to make a joke about a research task I had given it, 4.5 landed a better one-liner than 4.6 did, at least in my opinion.

I then repeated the key task I had given 4.5 earlier in the week: to write one of today’s Following items. And I set up a blind taste test by having Claude Code rename and reset the time stamps on the files for me so I couldn’t tell which was which.

But the result was obvious from the start. Even headlines were of noticeably different quality. One had written “AI-fueled panic wipes $285 billion from software stocks” as its title. The other went with “Welcome to the 'SaaSpocalypse',” which is more my style. (Sometimes, seeing myself reflected in Claude reminds me how annoying I am.)

I was a bit disappointed with the “wipes $285 billion” article. While it hit the right beats, it also included some extraneous details, such as when it decided to list the names of all 11 Cowork plugins Anthropic released this week (shill much, Claudella?). It also failed to add line breaks to our commentary roundup, which made it unreadable.

My other Claudella handled the line breaks. Its style was closer to my own, offering more cheek and drama (e.g. “The fear gripping Wall Street is fundamentally about whether AI is about to eat the software industry alive.”) It also included three of the same quotes I had chosen in my own roundup.

This second model — which turned out to be 4.6 — was clearly the winner. The Opus 4.6 update followed my instructions better, and produced writing that was far more stylish.

It still has a ways to go: about half of the piece needed to be cut, and the model had a penchant for ten-dollar words and amplifiers like “fundamentally” that I found annoying. And you can’t judge a model’s true quality by a single day of testing.

Still, there was something unsettling about feeling the AI frontier advance under my feet just a few days into this experiment.

What I learned

I went into this project with some anxiety about whether AI is poised to take my job. Overall, this experiment exacerbated my fears. In important ways, Claudella can do my job.

But it also has clear shortcomings. In particular, it has trouble understanding which parts of a style are important to replicate. It also struggles to respond to editor feedback. And when asked to write about AI, the Claude-based model shows a notably favorable bias toward Anthropic. (Which makes a second Anthropic-related conflict of interest for us here at Platformer. Casey’s boyfriend works there. Perhaps you’ve heard?)

Still, the bot’s work sometimes impressed me. And I saw a clear advance in ability today even from a relatively minor model update.

While I enjoyed seeing my AI agent get better at my job, I don't feel any desire to delegate my writing to it. I wouldn’t do it even if readers would accept it. As well as my AI mentee can now write, drafting is what I do to think. If I had Claude write my first drafts, even if I fact-checked them thoroughly, it would be a lot harder to tell whether the angle was my own view or the AI’s.

Still, I’ve decided to keep Claudella around. The bot excels at clip searches — looking for important quotes and analysis I might have missed. And I want to keep an eye on how quickly its skills improve.

And for me? The truth is that I’m less married to the idea of a career in journalism than I was at the beginning of this experiment.

I’ve had many conversations with my fellow AI reporters about what moats we might have against the advancement of AI automation. Chief among them are developing relationships with human sources, reporting on scenes in person, and getting scoops that people wouldn’t entrust an AI with.

But the things I love most about AI reporting are having an excuse to read really long computer science papers and then writing about them. I worry that if AI becomes a great writer and research assistant, AI journalism will mostly become about networking.

Regardless, I won't stop reading weird CS papers. And I won't stop writing. Not because I'm confident these skills will keep me employed, but because they're what I actually like doing.

Anthropic and OpenAI duel over models and ads

(See ethics disclosure!)

What happened: It's like a Super Bowl for nerds: Anthropic and OpenAI today released dueling enterprise-focused LLMs that improve on their previous agentic coding capabilities.

Claude Opus 4.6, Anthropic’s newest model, focuses more on “the most challenging parts of a task without being told to,” the company says, and “stays productive over longer sessions.” One notable addition is “agent teams,” which allow a user to split work across multiple agents and assign them different jobs.

Opus 4.6 is an upgrade for those looking to use it in law, finance and cybersecurity, Anthropic said. It scored the highest BigLaw Bench score of any Claude model at 90.2%, and is better at scrutinizing company data, regulatory filings, and market information. The model has already found more than 500 previously unknown high-severity security flaws in open-source libraries, Anthropic told Axios.

Across town, OpenAI unceiled GPT-5.3-Codex. The company said it improves on the coding capabilities of its predecessor, GPT-5.2-Codex, and on the reasoning and knowledge capabilities of GPT-5.2. The new model also runs 25 percent faster than previous models, and was the company’s “first model that was instrumental in creating itself,” it said. Rounding out the hype, OpenAI says 5.3 can go beyond coding to “do nearly anything developers and professionals can do on a computer.”

Speaking of the Super Bowl: the simultaneous release of the two models comes amid a very public fight over Anthropic’s debut ad for the Big game, where the company took aim at the idea of ads in chatbots like ChatGPT — and explained its decision to not have ads in Claude in an accompanying blog post.

In response, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman penned a scathing X post, where he called the ad “clearly dishonest.” “We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that,” Altman wrote.

Why we’re following: Anthropic's Super Bowl ad didn't mention any competitors by name, but still seemed notably more punchy than the company's typical communications. And it's fair to ask whether it was a tactical mistake — if you truly believe ads are going to ruin your competitors' products, why not let it simply happen? Never interrupt your enemy while he's making a mistake and all that.

But Altman's aggrieved response may have justified the approach, if only in hindsight. Pushed into doubling down on an approach he had previously called a "last resort," Altman was left pushing the dubious idea that Anthropic's $20-a-month product is "only for rich people" and its move to cut competitors off from its coding tools is "authoritarian" in nature. Anthropic could not have asked for better earned media, and the Super Bowl hasn't even happened yet.

As for the dueling models: it's too early to say which is superior for coding and other tasks. In limited early testing, Casey found 4.6 to represent a meaningful step forward at writing tasks — a meaningful step forward over 4.5, which was itself a notable improvement over its predecessor. Codex we are still (candidly) getting the hang of.

What people are saying:

“Anthropic vs openai is like kendrick vs drake but for nerds,” wrote @sonofalli on an X post that has garnered more than 180,000 views.

Altman’s lengthy Super Bowl ad crashout set off a firestorm of jokes, many of them not in his favor. @paularambles highlighted the silliness of the entire feud on X: “the best minds of my generation are thinking about ads about ads.”

“Can’t believe anthropic rage baited the guy and he fell for it. he’s even using capital letters in this tweet, they broke him,” @alxfazio posted.

@robj3d3 posted an excellent meme:

People are worried that AI will kill SaaS

What happened: A release of legal tools in Anthropic’s Cowork product triggered a big software stock selloff.

It's the latest chapter in months of software companies’ stocks declining as fears of AI disruption mount; the IGV Software Index has dropped 30% since September.

Spurring these declines is anxiety that AI coding might soon substitute for the enterprise software these companies make their money on. Companies including Microsoft and ServiceNow have reported underwhelming revenue this quarter, which doesn’t help.

But SaaS companies aren’t the only ones having a bit of trouble. The Financial Times reports that chip company Arm has dropped 8% because their revenue report came in only slightly higher than analysts’ forecasts. They stand to benefit from AI, given their CPU designs are in high demand as a component for data centers. But in a period of high anxiety about tech stocks, apparently that's not enough.

Why we’re following: AI definitely can do some impressive coding. But there isn’t clear evidence that the coding software AI companies are making substitutes for the specialized enterprise software SaaS companies sell. (Or for the logistical services and customer support that are often needed to make SaaS work in most organizations.) Professional software is valuable in large part because of its reliability. While we've seen plenty of cool AI coding projects, we haven’t yet seen evidence that they can substitute for the total package that good SaaS companies are selling to their customers.

At the same time, AI coding has gotten dramatically better in the past few years, and presumably that trend will continue. We can’t entirely blame sellers for extrapolating an upward trend.

What people are saying:

Arm’s CEO René Haas called the dip in tech stocks a “micro-hysteria,” suggesting it came from a misunderstanding of the impact AI is having on software, in an interview with the FT.

On X, Garry Tan, CEO of startup incubator Y Combinator, said that software absolutely has a future. But to realize that future, it needs to incorporate AI agents. “Software is not dead," he wrote" SaaS without agents may suffer, but Agent SaaS is alive, well, and winning.”

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang still believes in SaaS, too. “There’s this notion that the software industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI,” Huang said at Cisco Live. “It is the most illogical thing in the world, and time will prove itself.”

Added analyst Benedict Evans on Threads: "Every analyst and everyone who knows anything about enterprise software today: 'I can’t believe I actually have to explain why this death of SaaS thing is stupid.'”

        There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them.

Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns, and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry.

But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.

We want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests. So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see “sponsored” links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.

The nature of AI conversations

When people use search engines or social media, they’ve come to expect a mixture of organic and sponsored content. Filtering signal from noise is part of the interaction.

Conversations with AI assistants are meaningfully different. The format is open-ended; users often share context and reveal more than they would in a search query. This openness is part of what makes conversations with AI valuable, but it’s also what makes them susceptible to influence in ways that other digital products are not.

Our analysis of conversations with Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data private and anonymous) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal—the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.

We still have much to learn about the impact of AI models on the people who use them. Early research suggests both benefits—like people finding support they couldn’t access elsewhere—and risks, including the potential for models to reinforce harmful beliefs in vulnerable users. Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity. Our understanding of how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results.

Incentive structures

Being genuinely helpful is one of the core principles of Claude’s Constitution, the document that describes our vision for Claude’s character and guides how we train the model. An advertising-based business model would introduce incentives that could work against this principle.

Consider a concrete example. A user mentions they’re having trouble sleeping. An assistant without advertising incentives would explore the various potential causes—stress, environment, habits, and so on—based on what might be most insightful to the user. An ad-supported assistant has an additional consideration: whether the conversation presents an opportunity to make a transaction. These objectives may often align—but not always. And, unlike a list of search results, ads that influence a model’s responses may make it difficult to tell whether a given recommendation comes with a commercial motive or not. Users shouldn’t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.

Even ads that don’t directly influence an AI model’s responses and instead appear separately within the chat window would compromise what we want Claude to be: a clear space to think and work. Such ads would also introduce an incentive to optimize for engagement—for the amount of time people spend using Claude and how often they return. These metrics aren’t necessarily aligned with being genuinely helpful. The most useful AI interaction might be a short one, or one that resolves the user’s request without prompting further conversation.

We recognize that not all advertising implementations are equivalent. More transparent or opt-in approaches—where users explicitly choose to see sponsored content—might avoid some of the concerns outlined above. But the history of ad-supported products suggests that advertising incentives, once introduced, tend to expand over time as they become integrated into revenue targets and product development, blurring boundaries that were once more clear-cut. We’ve chosen not to introduce these dynamics into Claude.

Our approach

Anthropic is focused on businesses, developers, and helping our users flourish. Our business model is straightforward: we generate revenue through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, and we reinvest that revenue into improving Claude for our users. This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions.

Expanding access to Claude is central to our public benefit mission, and we want to do it without selling our users’ attention or data to advertisers. To that end, we’ve brought AI tools and training to educators in over 60 countries, begun national AI education pilots with multiple governments, and made Claude available to nonprofits at a significant discount. We continue to invest in our smaller models so that our free offering remains at the frontier of intelligence, and we may consider lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing where there is clear demand for it. Should we need to revisit this approach, we’ll be transparent about our reasons for doing so.

Supporting commerce

AI will increasingly interact with commerce, and we look forward to supporting this in ways that help our users. We’re particularly interested in the potential of agentic commerce, where Claude acts on a user’s behalf to handle a purchase or booking end to end. And we’ll continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare, or buy products, connect with businesses, and more—when they choose to do so.

We’re also exploring more ways to make Claude a focused space to be at your most productive. Users can already connect third-party tools they use for work—like Figma, Asana, and Canva—and interact with them directly within Claude. We expect to introduce many more useful integrations and expand this toolkit over time.

All third-party interactions will be grounded in the same overarching design principle: they should be initiated by the user (where the AI is working for them) rather than an advertiser (where the AI is working, at least in part, for someone else). Today, whether someone asks Claude to research running shoes, compare mortgage rates, or recommend a restaurant for a special occasion, Claude’s only incentive is to give a helpful answer. We’d like to preserve that.

A trusted tool for thought

We want our users to trust Claude to help them keep thinking—about their work, their challenges, and their ideas.

Our experience of using the internet has made it easy to assume that advertising on the products we use is inevitable. But open a notebook, pick up a well-crafted tool, or stand in front of a clean chalkboard, and there are no ads in sight.

We think Claude should work the same way.

        Incremental learning allows models to acquire new knowledge and keep pace with the unpredictability of the real world without forgetting old knowledge. Nonstationary data means that the data distributions are not static. When implemented successfully, continual learning results in models that maintain task-specific knowledge and can also generalize across dynamic data distributions.

Continual learning models are designed to apply new data adaptively in changing environments. Also known as lifelong learning, continual learning is inspired by neuroscience concepts relating to the way humans learn new things while also retaining what they already know. If a person learns to skateboard, they do not immediately forget how to ride a bicycle.

Traditional machine learning systems train models on large static datasets. The dataset passes through the model’s algorithm in batches as the model updates its weights, or parameters. The model processes the entire dataset multiple times, with each cycle known as an epoch.

Developers identify the purpose of the deep learning model ahead of time, assemble a training dataset to fit the learning objective and train the model on that data. Then, the model is tested, validated and deployed. Fine-tuning the machine learning model with more data can tailor its performance to new tasks.

Traditional learning methods do not fully reflect the dynamism of the real world. Supervised learning uses static datasets with known outcomes. Unsupervised learning lets a model sort through data on its own, but the training data is still finite and unchanging. Reinforcement learning is similarly safe and constrained.

In contrast to traditional learning methods, continual learning attempts to apply the plasticity of the human brain to artificial neural networks. Neuroplasticity is the quality of the brain that allows it to adapt, learning without forgetting previous knowledge as it encounters changing circumstances.

Some types of continual learning still begin with offline batch-training in multiple epochs, similar to traditional offline training. Online continual learning solely trains models with a stream of single-pass data.

The world is in a constant state of flux. Humans and other animals evolved the ability to learn to help them thrive in adversity. For example, if one food supply runs out, figuring out how to eat something else can ensure survival.

But not all animals are as capable. Koalas cannot even recognize their primary food source—eucalyptus leaves—if the leaves are removed from a tree and placed in a pile on a plate. While koalas sometimes eat other leaves from other trees, they can conceive of food only as “leaves on trees.” Their smooth brains cannot deviate from this expectation.

Consider a computer vision model intended for use in self-driving cars. The model must know how to recognize other vehicles on the road, but also pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, animals and hazards. It must perceive and adapt flawlessly to changing weather and traffic patterns, such as a sudden downpour or if an emergency vehicle is approaching with its lights and siren on.

Languages change over time. A natural language processing (NLP) model should be able to process shifts in what words mean and how they are used. Similarly, a model designed for robotics must be able to adapt if the robot’s environment changes.

AI models are resource-intensive. They can cost millions of dollars to train and consume large amounts of electricity and water. It isn’t always possible to deploy new models whenever new tasks arise. Nor is it computationally feasible to preserve every single previous task in a model’s available memory.

Continual learning allows large language models (LLMs) and other neural networks to adapt to shifting use cases without forgetting how to handle previous challenges. Enterprises can minimize the number of models in operation by expanding the potential capabilities of each model they use.

Task-incremental learning is a step-by-step approach to multitask learning in which an algorithm must learn to accomplish a series of different tasks. It must be clear to the algorithm which task is expected of it, either by the tasks being sufficiently distinct from one another or by labeling inputs with the appropriate output.

A real-world example of task-incremental learning would be learning how to speak Japanese, then Mandarin, then Czech and then Spanish. It is usually clear which language the speaker should use at any particular time.

Because tasks are streamed to the model in sequence, the challenge is one of helping ensure that the model can sufficiently transfer learning from one to the next. The total number of tasks is also not always known in advance, especially with models already in deployment.

The prevention of catastrophic forgetting is a given—getting the model to apply transfer learning is the real goal with task-incremental learning methodologies.

Domain-incremental learning covers challenges in which the data distribution changes, but the type of challenge stays the same. The conditions surrounding the task have changed in some way, but the potential outputs have not. Unlike task-incremental learning, the model is not required to identify the specific task to solve.

For example, a model built for optical character recognition (OCR) would need to recognize various document formats and font styles. It is not important to know how or why the environment has changed, but to recognize that it has and complete the task regardless.

Changes in data distribution are a longstanding challenge in machine learning because models are typically trained on a discrete, static dataset. When data distributions change post-deployment, domain-incremental learning can help models mitigate performance losses.

Class-incremental learning is when a classifier model must perform a series of classification tasks with a growing number of output classes. The model must be able to both correctly solve each instance while also recalling classes encountered in previous instances.

A model trained to classify vehicles as cars or trucks might later be asked to identify buses and motorcycles. The model will be expected to maintain its understanding of all classes learned over time, not just the options in each instance. If trained on “cars versus trucks” and later given “buses versus motorcycles,” the model should also successfully determine whether a vehicle is a car or a bus.

State-of-the-art class-incremental learning is one of the most difficult continual learning challenges because the emergence of new classes can erode the distinctions between previously established classes.

Replay techniques involve regularly exposing a model during training activations to samples from previous training datasets. Replay-based continual learning saves samples of older data in a memory buffer and incorporates it into subsequent training cycles. The continued exposure to older data prevents the model from overfitting to new data.

Memory techniques are reliably effective but come at the cost of regular access to previous data, which requires sufficient storage space. Situations that involve the use of sensitive personal data can also prevent problems for memory technique implementation.

Generative replay uses a generative model to synthesize samples of previous data to feed to the model being trained, such as a classifier that needs to learn new classes without forgetting old ones.

        <hr/>
        As a consortium of investors led by Oracle's Larry Ellison took control of TikTok's U.S. business, users accused the app of throttling videos about Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and posts related to the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.

Posts went viral on social media pinning the perceived suppression of content on TikTok's new bosses. The hashtag #TikTokCensorship gained traction on X, droves of users downloaded TikTok alternatives and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and lawmakers in the European Union, called for investigations.

But a data center outage that wreaked havoc on the platform appears to have disrupted all categories of posts, rather than singling out political content, according to a new analysis in the publication Good Authority. It was conducted by eight academics examining how videos were trending during the ownership transition.

Using viewership metrics across more than 100,000 videos, the researchers zeroed in on videos about ICE, Pretti, Renee Good, the woman killed by an ICE agent last month and the keywords "Trump" and "Epstein." They compared how often TikTok recommended the content compared with non-political posts about things like food recipes and the Oscars.

Around the time of TikTok's server outage, "posts about all of these topics dropped to almost zero," wrote Benjamin Guinaudeau, a professor at Université Laval in Québec, and his seven co-authors. "Total views plummeted directly after the TikTok outage, and then began to rebound."

While cries of systemic top-down political censorship do not appear to be supported by publicly available data, the researchers say it is still possible the new owners of TikTok have begun to reconfigure content rules.

"It could be that small numbers of posts were removed or shadowbanned in a way that is not visible in the overall trends," wrote the researchers, who added that users who experienced that the word "Epstein" was being blocked in private direct messages was not possible to study, since that data is not accessible.

Part of the challenge in studying TikTok, the academics note, is that the platform does not grant the type of access to researchers required to do comprehensive reviews of how content moderation is unfolding — what is being amplified, what is being suppressed and what priorities or policies may be driving those trends.

"Our position is that TikTok and other platforms should provide a way for third-party researchers to study their recommender systems and look for evidence of undue political influence," the researchers wrote.

The timing of the TikTok disruption struck a nerve because many users have expressed wariness about how Ellison, a staunch ally of President Trump, could remake the app in his vision, just as the Ellison family has overhauled CBS in bid to appeal to conservatives.

"The new owners will have to earn the trust of Americans. Because the TikTok law effectively gave the president the power to select the new owners, TikTok U.S. will have to show that it is not biased in his favor," said Anupam Chander, a professor of law and technology at Georgetown University. "It could demonstrate its political neutrality by welcoming academic researchers and by hiring well-respected liberals within the company."

In addition to Ellison's Oracle, a cloud computing and data center giant, TikTok's new investors include Silver Lake, a prominent private equity firm, and Emirati-based investment company MGX.

ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, will keep a minority stake of the new U.S. entity, as well as still own the powerful algorithm. It will be retrained using Americans' data.

Backers of the U.S. entity insist China will not be able to exert control over the algorithm, which will be supervised by Oracle. Yet since the technology will not be sold away from Beijing, some observers question the arrangement.

A TikTok spokeswoman said no changes have been made to its algorithm since the new investors took the reins of the social media company's American business. The deal was struck to bring the app in compliance with a federal law that required TikTok distance itself from its Chinese parent company over national security concerns.

"Right now, TikTok can say just about anything related to algorithm changes and we can't verify it," Guinaudeau told NPR.

He added: "Now we could see massive changes like if they suddenly stopped showing all political content, which was one of the accusations we examine in the post. But until they make more extensive data available to researchers it's nearly impossible to detect subtle changes to their 'For You' recommender system ('the algorithm')."

        NewsGuard recently introduced guardrails that completely detoxed AI models from hostile disinformation campaigns. Overlaying two NewsGuard datasets on a commercial large language model, red-teaming analysts eliminated all false claims seeded by Russian influence operations. In contrast, when our data sets were not overlaid, those same prompts led the top 10 chatbots to yield Russian disinformation in one of five responses.

        <hr/>
        Google’s AI chatbot Gemini has surpassed 750 million monthly active users (MAUs), according to the company’s fourth-quarter 2025 earnings. This figure illustrates the rapid consumer adoption of Gemini, which has quickly become a prominent player in the AI space.

Last quarter, Google reported 650 million monthly active users for Gemini, indicating substantial growth in a short period. In comparison, Meta AI has reported nearly 500 million monthly users. However, while Gemini is gaining traction, it still trails behind its biggest rival, ChatGPT, which is estimated to have around 810 million MAUs in late 2025.

The recently revealed number comes on the heels of the launch of Gemini 3, which showcases the company’s most advanced model yet, providing responses that the company claims exhibit an unprecedented level of depth and nuance.

CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted that the introduction of Gemini 3 in AI mode was a “positive driver” for the company’s growth and emphasized that continued investment and iteration will maintain this momentum.

Google recently rolled out a more affordable plan, the Google AI Plus, priced at $7.99 per month. The plan is expected to drive further growth by appealing to budget-conscious consumers, although it was made available too recently to have any influence on the quarterly figures.

“We are focused on a free tier and subscriptions and seeing great growth,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said during the call to investors.

Gemini’s growth is particularly notable given Alphabet’s overall financial performance. The company has surpassed $400 billion in annual revenue for the first time this quarter. Google attributes the achievement to the expansion of its AI division, which has seen increased demand. Recently, Google introduced the latest generation of its TPU AI accelerator chip, called Ironwood, to compete with Nvidia.

“The launch of Gemini 3 was a major milestone, and we have great momentum. Our first party models, like Gemini, now process over 10 billion tokens per minute via direct API use by our customers, and the Gemini App has grown to over 750 million monthly active users. Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,” Pichai stated in today’s release.

        <hr/>
        On Thursday, Anthropic released the latest version of Opus — its most advanced model and a particularly important model for Claude Code. Opus 4.5 was only released last November, and with 4.6, the company has sought to broaden its model’s capabilities and appeal, allowing for a greater variety of uses and customers.

Perhaps the most notable addition to the newest version of Opus is the inclusion of what the company calls “agent teams” — teams of agents that can split larger tasks into segmented jobs.

“Instead of one agent working through tasks sequentially, you can split the work across multiple agents — each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others,” the company says. Scott White, Head of Product at Anthropic, compared the new feature to having a talented team of humans working for you, noting that the segmenting of agent responsibilities allows them “to coordinate in parallel [and work] faster.” The agent teams are currently available in a research preview for API users and subscribers.

Opus 4.6 also comes with a longer context window — meaning that the program has a capacity to recall a greater amount of information per user session. The new model offers 1 million tokens of context, which is comparable to what the company’s Sonnet (versions 4 and 4.5) currently offers. Those context windows allow for work involving larger code bases and can also allow for the processing of larger documents, the company says.

The new version of Opus also integrates Claude directly into PowerPoint as an accessible side panel. This is a step up from PowerPoint’s previous integration with the chatbot. Previously, a user could tell Claude to create a PowerPoint deck, but the file would then have to be transferred to PowerPoint to edit the presentation, White said. Now the presentation can be crafted within PowerPoint, with direct help from Claude.

White told TechCrunch that Opus has evolved from a model that was highly capable in one particular domain — software development — into a program that could be “really useful for a broader set” of knowledge workers. “We noticed a lot of people who are not professional software developers using Claude Code simply because it was a really amazing engine to do tasks,” he said. White added that the kinds of people the company has seen using it include not just software engineers, but product managers, financial analysts, and people from a variety of other industries.

        <hr/>
        Reddit shares rose 5% in after-hours trading Thursday after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat on the top and bottom lines and gave strong guidance for the start of 2026.

Here's how the company did compared with LSEG estimates:

Earnings per share: $1.24 vs. 94 cents expected

Revenue: $726 million vs. $665 million expected

The company said it expects first-quarter sales to come in the range of $595 million to $605 million, which is higher than Wall Street expectations of $577 million. Adjusted earnings in the first quarter are projected to come in between $210 million and $220 million, ahead of StreetAccount's estimates of $203 million.

Reddit also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.

The company's fourth-quarter revenue rose 70% year over year, while net income was $252 million, up nearly 255% from the same period a year ago.

Reddit's sales in the U.S. market came in at $583 million in the fourth quarter, topping analyst estimates of $529 million.

The company's global daily active uniques, or DAUq, grew 19% year over year to 121.4 million in the fourth quarter, ahead of the 120 million that Wall Street was expecting.

Fourth-quarter U.S. DAUq grew 9% year over year to 52.5 million, slightly ahead of the 52.3 million that analysts were projecting.

The company said that logged-in DAUq for the U.S., which refers to users who have registered for Reddit accounts, rose 5% year over year to 23 million. That was slower than the 7% year over year growth Reddit said it recorded during the third quarter when its logged-in DAUq for the U.S. came in at 23.1 million. This is the sixth straight quarter in which Reddit's U.S. logged-in user growth has slowed.

Investors have been monitoring Reddit's logged-in DAUq metric because users who have created accounts are more lucrative to the company's online advertising business. These Reddit account holders generally use the platform and engage with other users more frequently than those who may have stumbled into Reddit via Google search, which the company refers to as logged-out DAUq.

In an investor letter, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the company plans to "phase out reporting on logged-in and logged-out later this year" because there's now less of a distinction between the two metrics than in the past. That's because the company has been working on features intended to keep both logged-in users and logged-out users glued to the platform, Huffman said.

"As the industry evolves, how we think about our product and users must evolve too," Huffman wrote. "We've historically reported logged-in vs. logged-out users, but as some of our work to streamline onboarding — instant personalization, for example — blurs the line between these states, the distinction between them makes less sense."

Reddit finance chief Drew Vollero told analysts during an earnings call that the company will continue to report both metrics for the first two quarters of 2026.

Regarding the company's data-licensing deals with Google and OpenAI, Huffman said during the earnings call that "relationships with both companies are very healthy" and that "the conversation is shifting from a purely business deal to more of a product partnership."

"Specifically, what we're looking for in any relationship like this is can we bring users into the community parts of Reddit," Huffman said.

Regarding Reddit's efforts to unify its traditional search tool with its more recent generative AI search feature, Huffman said that the company has learned that "the GenAI search results will just be better for most queries."

Unlike traditional search, cutting-edge GenAI search and chat tools excel at providing results that contain "multiple perspectives from lots of people," he said.

        <hr/>
        Google said it plans to double its capital expenditure this year to as much as $185bn as strong growth in its advertising and cloud businesses added to the search giant’s financial firepower for its huge bet on AI.

The Mountain View, California-based group increased its forecast for capex in 2026 to a range of $175bn to $185bn, far exceeding analysts’ expectations of about $120bn, Google’s parent company Alphabet said on Wednesday.

Fourth-quarter capital investment almost doubled to $27.9bn compared with the year before, pushing spending in 2025 to $91.4bn.

The steep increase in planned capital expenditure hit shares in Alphabet on Thursday, with the stock down 5 per cent in early trading.

Google has gained momentum in the AI race in recent months with the launch of new Gemini models, using its vast income and advanced in-house chips to recover ground against rivals including OpenAI.

Chief executive Sundar Pichai has argued that its huge AI investments were supported by big jumps in earnings and cash flow, as its advertising revenue continues to climb and AI demand lifted its cloud computing arm.

“Our capex spend this year is an eye towards the future,” he said. “The demand we are seeing across the board for our services — and what we need to invest in Google DeepMind and in cloud — is exceptionally strong.”

Pichai said that despite the big investment in data centres and its own custom AI chips, known as TPUs, he still expects demand from its DeepMind research lab and from customers to outstrip the new computing power it can bring online.

Investors have been sensitive to trends in AI spending, with fears spreading about a bubble developing in public and private markets as revenues lag far behind the cash being pumped into the technology.

When Microsoft also disclosed a big jump in capex last week — now set to exceed $140bn this year — its shares fell more than 10 per cent. By contrast, Meta rose even as it forecast annual capex of $135bn because the social media giant was able to show that AI was improving advertising efficacy.

Google’s net income increased 30 per cent to $34.5bn in the fourth quarter from the previous year, beating analysts’ expectations of $31.9bn compiled by FactSet. Alphabet made $132bn of profit in 2025.

Revenue rose 18 per cent to $113.8bn, beating the average estimate of $111.3bn. Annual sales surpassed $400bn for the first time.

Its core search and advertising business grew 17 per cent year on year in the quarter to bring in $63.1bn in revenue, beating estimates of $61.3bn. This helped to quell fears that AI chatbots from rivals including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Elon Musk’s Grok are poaching users.

Pichai said he “hasn’t seen any evidence of cannibalisation” of ad revenues as Google augments its traditional search results with “AI mode” and “overview” answers, nor from the launch of its Gemini chatbot.

Chief business officer Philipp Schindler said that AI had added to its understanding of users’ intent, which “has significantly expanded our ability to deliver ads on longer and more complex searches” that advertisers are willing to pay more for.

Cloud revenues rose 48 per cent to $17.7bn against expectations of $16.3bn, as demand for computing power to train and run AI models increases. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said that the acceleration in cloud earnings “speaks to momentum in AI, Gemini and the core businesses”.

Pichai said that Google’s backlog of cloud contracts had increased to $240bn by the end of December, 55 per cent more than in September.

“The number of deals in 2025 over $1bn surpassed the previous three years combined,” he added.

Investors also took comfort from Google’s free cash flow, which grew to $24.5bn in the quarter — up from $14.3bn in the final period of 2024 — and totalled $73.3bn for the year.

Alphabet shares have rallied 61 per cent in the past 12 months, pushing its market cap past $4tn to surpass Microsoft as the world’s third-largest company.

Pichai also pointed to growth in the Gemini App, its main consumer AI product, which now has 750mn monthly users, 100mn more than in the previous quarter. However, this still trails market leader OpenAI, which claims more than 850mn people use ChatGPT weekly.

ZDNET's key takeaways

Anthropic debuts Claude Opus 4.6 for enterprise knowledge work.

It's built for end-to-end autonomy with fewer rewrites.

Previews include PowerPoint, agent teams, and 1M context.

Anthropic today announced Claude Opus 4.6, which the company says is its most capable model for enterprise and knowledge work. This new large language model is an upgrade to Opus 4.5, with broader autonomy and more accurate first-try results.

Anthropic describes Opus 4.6 as a "frontier model" designed to handle complex end-to-end enterprise workflows. The term "frontier model" is used by the AI industry to describe AI systems that are at the leading edge of current AI capabilities.

Using Opus 4.6, "Documents, spreadsheets, and presentations will need less back-and-forth on iterations," according to an email ZDNET received from a company representative.

Performance leap for knowledge work

Anthropic says, "For AI to truly tackle enterprise work, it must succeed at three key outcomes: finding information, analyzing it, and producing something from it." According to the company, 4.6 performs well across all three key outcomes.

All this indicates a jump in the AI's agentic capabilities, with an ability to handle complex, long-run tasks in addition to isolated subtasks.

Using travel as an analogy, a simple subtask might be telling a driver to "turn right at the next light," while a more complex task would be to tell that driver located in New York City to drive to Faneuil Hall in Boston. It would be up to the driver to determine the steps and get there. Likewise, the idea with Opus 4.6's broader autonomy is that it can plan and execute the complex series of steps for larger-scale assignments.

According to the company, Opus 4.6 also reduces the number of corrections and reframes required for "common enterprise deliverables."

According to Yashodha Bhavnani, head of AI at cloud storage vendor Box, "Claude Opus 4.6 excels in high-reasoning tasks, like multi-source analysis, across legal, financial, and technical content. Box's eval showed a 10% lift in performance, reaching 68% vs. a 58% baseline, and near-perfect scores in technical domains."

Anthropic is also positioning Claude Opus 4.6 as a valuable resource for financial modeling. The AI can help with regulatory filings, market reports, and internal data, producing rapid results for projects that would previously take analysts days to complete. Anthropic says Opus 4.6 "handles the nuance required for compliance-sensitive output."

Opus 4.6 is proving to be powerful for legal reasoning as well. According to Niko Grupen, head of AI research at legal AI company Harvey, "Claude Opus 4.6 achieved the highest BigLaw Bench score of any Claude model at 90.2%. With 40% perfect scores and 84% above 0.8, it's remarkably capable for legal reasoning."

Another intriguing new capability is Claude's integration with PowerPoint. Once released, Claude will be able to work directly inside PowerPoint (presumably as a plugin) and be able to read layouts, fonts, and slide masters. This way, edits by the AI can stay "on-brand and on-template."

Also: I tried a Claude Code alternative that's local, open source, and completely free - how it works

According to the company, Claude Opus 4.6 can "build slides from a corporate template, restructure a storyline, convert bullets into diagrams, or generate a full deck from a description -- all without leaving the app."

The PowerPoint capability is in research preview, available for Max, Team, and Enterprise plans.

Developer and agent advances

Claude is particularly well known for its agentic coding capabilities. Claude Opus 4.6 builds on the strengths of Opus 4.5 with more agentic behavior. The company says that autonomous coding improvements will particularly benefit developers with large code bases, long-horizon tasks, and complex implementations.

Also: Stop using ChatGPT for everything: My go-to AI models for research, coding, and more (and which I avoid)

As a user of Claude Code, this brings to mind a key question. Claude Code using Opus 4.5 often needs to run compaction sequences that free up available resources. This process not only takes a long time, but it often interrupts project flow.

If 4.6 is supposed to be able to address even larger code bases, then the context window needs to grow. Anthropic says that "Claude Opus 4.6 will support 1M context (in beta) at launch. This is the first Opus model with long context." It'll be very interesting to see that in action.

Agent teams

The company is offering a research preview of agent teams in Claude Opus 4.6 to API and subscription Claude users. The company says teams "let Claude Code work the way a real engineering team does. Instead of one agent working through tasks sequentially, you can split the work across multiple agents -- each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others."

Also: I let Anthropic's Claude Cowork loose on my files, and it was both brilliant and scary

I've been struggling with Claude running multiple parallel agents in Claude Code using Opus 4.5, particularly in the Xcode 26.3 preview. I've found that once the primary agent kicks off a series of subagents, they're not visible for my hands-on management. When one or more of them gets stuck (as they seem to do with disturbing regularity), the whole agentic coding process just hangs.

I'm hoping that agent teams in Claude Opus 4.6 provide better transparency, better overall management, and better damage control, so if they get stuck, they report back and ask for help. Stay tuned. I'll do some testing and report back on overall performance.

That said, Michele Catasta, president of AI no-code company Replit says, "Claude Opus 4.6 is a huge leap for agentic planning. It breaks complex tasks into independent subtasks, runs tools and subagents in parallel, and identifies blockers with real precision."

Availability

Anthropic says, "Claude Opus 4.6 is available today on claude.ai, our API, and all major cloud platforms." Token pricing hasn't changed from the previous release for API users.

Some features like PowerPoint, the 1M context, and agent teams are described as research previews or beta, and are not available for wide release at launch. But Anthropic is working on AI time. So items in research preview and beta are more likely to be weeks away than months away. After all, it does have an AI to help it code its products.

What do you think about Claude Opus 4.6 and Anthropic's push toward more autonomous, enterprise-focused AI? Do you see real value in features like agent teams, 1M context, or deep integrations like PowerPoint? Would you trust an AI to handle complex work end-to-end with less human oversight, or do you still prefer tighter control? How do you think this compares to other frontier models you've used? What questions do you still have about availability or real-world performance? Let us know in the comments below.

ZDNET's key takeaways

GPT-5.3-Codex helped debug and deploy parts of itself.

Codex can be steered mid-task without losing context.

"Underspecified" prompts now produce richer, more usable results.

OpenAI today announced the launch of GPT-5.3-Codex, which OpenAI claims is the most capable agentic coding model yet released. Interestingly enough, Anthropic, maker of Claude Code, is also releasing a new powerful model at exactly the same time. Anthropic's model, Opus 4.6, is a more general-purpose model, but Anthropic is well known for its Claude Code offering.

Also: Anthropic says its new Claude Opus 4.6 can nail your work deliverables on the first try

As with Anthropic's Opus 4.6, OpenAI describes GPT-5.3 as a "frontier model." This is a term the AI industry uses to describe models at the bleeding edge of performance and capability. According to OpenAI, the new 5.3 Codex runs 25% faster, enabling longer-running tasks.

OpenAI's GPT-5.3-Codex is being announced just days after OpenAI's announcement and release of a Mac app dedicated to Codex.

Astute watchers of OpenAI's GPT models will notice the 5.3 version number on this release. OpenAI's current hottest GPT release is GPT-5.2, not GPT-5.3. Although nothing has been announced or even hinted at, I'm guessing we're not too far away from a general GPT-5.3 release in the next few days or weeks.

Coding AI, code thyself

I'm not sure if this is incredibly exciting or deeply disturbing. GPT-5.3-Codex is OpenAI's "first model that was instrumental in creating itself." The Codex team used Codex to debug its own training, manage its own deployment, and diagnose test results.

Also: I got 4 years of product development done in 4 days for $200, and I'm still stunned

OpenAI's blog post says, "With GPT-5.3-Codex, Codex goes from an agent that can write and review code to an agent that can do nearly anything developers and professionals can do on a computer." Let's just hope it doesn't decide that humans are superfluous.

More than just coding

Acknowledging that developers, designers, product managers, and data scientists do a lot more in their jobs than just code, GPT-5.3-Codex is designed to support "all of the work in the software lifecycle -- debugging, deploying, monitoring, writing PRDs, editing copy, user research, tests, metrics, and more." The company reports that it can help you build whatever you want to build, specifically mentioning building slide decks and spreadsheets.

Also: Want local vibe coding? This AI stack replaces Claude Code and Codex - and it's free

The company says that this model is designed to be steered mid-task, with continuous interaction and no loss of context. The new Codex Mac app (and, presumably, an upcoming Windows app) can definitely help in maintaining interaction with the model as it works on projects for you.

The span of operation is also much longer. Codex can run processes that take more than one day. As a test, OpenAI built two web-based games. Using the "skill" feature introduced with the Mac app, testers used a web gaming development skill to build the two games over millions of tokens.

The blog post specifically highlighted how GPT-5.3-Codex better understands intent. If you're making a "day-to-day website," the blog post reports that "Simple or underspecified prompts now default to sites with more functionality and sensible defaults, giving you a stronger starting canvas to bring your ideas to life."

Also: OpenAI's Codex just got its own Mac app - and anyone can try it for free now

In other words, if you ask Codex to "make me something pretty," it will. I had some significant success asking Codex 5.2 to redesign some parts of my WordPress security plugin to make the administration screens more attractive and compelling. Some of the design features that existed in earlier Codex versions have been improved upon in this latest release.

Other examples cited by the blog include dynamic pricing displays and automated testimonial carousels.

Frontier benchmarks and technical performance

One of the subtexts I picked up in the technical briefing I participated in last week for the Mac Codex app was the desire on the part of some of its customers for faster response times. I know that I often set Codex or Claude Code off on a programming task and then switch to some other activity while waiting for the process to complete.

While my experience has been that agentic coding speeds up my development process from months to days, that wait is still a bit painful. So increasing the performance, and thereby the output speed of the models, is always a win.

According to the blog post, "GPT-5.3-Codex sets a new industry high on SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal Bench." The company says assignments take fewer tokens, increasing efficiency. OpenAI also says, "GPT-5.3-Codex sets a new industry high on SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal Bench, and shows strong performance on OSWorld and GDPVal." These are benchmarks the company uses to measure coding, agentic operations, and real-world capabilities.

Security, infrastructure, and safeguards

OpenAI has a published Preparedness Framework, which it uses for measuring and protecting against severe harm from frontier AI capabilities. In the blog post announcing GPT-5.3-Codex, the company says that this new model is the first one it classifies as "high capability" for cybersecurity tasks.

It's been trained to identify software vulnerabilities, with expanded safeguards and monitoring. Concurrently, the company is launching Trusted Access for Cyber, a pilot program to accelerate cyber defense research, and is donating $10M in API credit grants to support cybersecurity research. If your organization is engaged in "good faith security research," you can apply for API credits through the company's Cybersecurity Grant Program.

Also: Is ChatGPT Plus still worth your $20? I compared it to the Free, Go, and Pro plans - here's my advice

Supporting these actions, the blog post reports, "We're taking a precautionary approach and deploying our most comprehensive cybersecurity safety stack to date. Our mitigations include dual-use safety training, automated monitoring, trusted access for advanced capabilities, and enforcement pipelines, including threat intelligence."

Availability

GPT-5.3-Codex is available now with paid ChatGPT plans across the Codex app, CLI, IDE extension, and web. API access is planned, and the company expects to deliver 25% faster interactions. The Codex usage promotion we reported earlier this week for free ChatGPT users still stands, but they'll be limited to GPT-5.2-Codex for now.

What do you think about GPT-5.3-Codex and the direction OpenAI is taking with more autonomous, long-running coding agents? Have you tried Codex or similar tools like Claude Code in real development work? If so, did the speed or autonomy change how you work? How do you feel about an AI model helping debug, deploy, and even participate in its own development? Do the cybersecurity safeguards and "frontier model" positioning reassure you, or raise new concerns? Let us know in the comments below.

        <hr/>
        Last year, Roblox launched an open source AI model that could generate 3D objects on the platform, helping users quickly design digital items such as furniture, vehicles, and accessories. The company claims the tool, called Cube 3D, has so far helped users generate over 1.8 million 3D objects since it was rolled out last March.

On Wednesday, the company launched the open beta for its anticipated 4D creation feature that lets creators make not just static 3D models, but fully functional and interactive objects. The feature has been in early access since November.

Roblox says 4D creation adds an important new layer: interactivity. With this technology, users can design items that can move and react to players in the game.

​At launch, there are two types of object templates (called schemas) that creators can try out.

The first is the “Car-5” schema, which is used to create a car made of five separate parts: the main body and four wheels. Previously, cars were a single, solid 3D object that couldn’t move. The new system breaks down objects into parts and assigns behaviors to each so that they function individually within the virtual world. The AI therefore can generate cars with spinning wheels, making them more realistic and interactive. ​

The second is called “Body-1,” which can generate any object made from a single piece, like a simple box or sculpture.

The first experience with 4D generation is a game called Wish Master, where players can generate cars they can drive, planes they can fly, and even dragons.

​In the future, Roblox plans to let creators make their own schemas so they’ll have more freedom to define how objects behave. The company says it is also developing new technology that could use a reference image to create a detailed 3D model that matches the image’s style (example below).

The company says it is developing more ways to help people create games and experiences using AI, including a project it has dubbed “real-time dreaming.” Roblox CEO David Baszucki last month explained that this project would let creators build new worlds using “keyboard navigation and sharing real-time text prompts.”

        Amazon has announced that its generative AI-powered digital assistant Alexa Plus is now available to all Prime members in the US via any Alexa-enabled device, Alexa.com, and the Alexa mobile app. If you don’t have Prime, you can access the assistant on a new free tier on the web and app, or pay $20 a month for unlimited access to Alexa Plus, without Prime.

Alexa Plus initially launched in March 2025 in an Early Access program and, over the last year, has slowly expanded to tens of millions of users, Daniel Rausch, vice president of Alexa and Echo, told The Verge in an interview.

Now, the smarter, more conversational assistant is moving out of Early Access and is officially available to anyone in the US. Early Access recently launched in Canada and Mexico, and according to Rausch, a closed Beta program is being trialed in the UK, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, with Early Access expected to follow.

In the US, the new tiers for using Alexa Plus are as follows:

Alexa Plus for Prime: This gives you and your household unlimited access to Alexa Plus everywhere, across Alexa-enabled devices, Alexa.com, and the Alexa app, as part of the $14.99 a month / $139 a year membership.

Alexa Plus: For $19.99, you get the same access as Prime members, but you pay $5 more per month and don’t get the other Prime benefits.

Alexa Plus Chat: This new, free option lets non-Prime members try Alexa Plus through a chat experience at Alexa.com and in the Alexa app. This is basically a chatbot where you can ask questions and do research, much like ChatGPT or Claude. Rausch says this tier will be limited based on use.

If you have Prime and use any Echo devices, Alexa Plus will arrive shortly (or may already be there) via a software upgrade. You can also say “Alexa, upgrade to Alexa Plus” or log in to your Amazon account at Alexa.com. Rausch says you can choose to opt out of the upgrade. And if you decide you want to revert to the old Alexa after upgrading, that is still an option.

If you don’t have Prime but want to try Alexa Plus, you can go to Amazon.com/AlexaPlus.

What is Alexa Plus?

Based on an entirely new architecture and powered by large language models from Amazon Nova and Anthropic, Alexa Plus is a ground-up rebuild of Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant. It has moved from being a basic command-and-control voice assistant to a “foundational AI assistant” that can understand and respond to natural language.

Now, in addition to setting timers, playing music, and controlling smart home gadgets, the voice assistant can answer more complex queries, respond to more in-depth requests, and make it easier to control your smart home by creating routines with your voice.

It can also manage your family’s calendars and meal plans, provide step-by-step recipe directions, make restaurant reservations, book an Uber or a home repair person, or buy concert tickets.

You can also use Alexa Plus as a text-based chatbot via Alexa.com on the web, where it’s designed for deeper research, planning, and generating content.

Since its launch, Rausch says people have been using the Alexa Plus voice assistant twice as much. “We continue to see week-over-week customer engagement with Alexa Plus going up.”

The chatbot version of Alexa Plus is newer; the web interface launched last month, and the Alexa app was recently redesigned to put the chatbot front and center. “A lot of customers aren’t sure about subscribing to an additional AI chatbot experience for an additional $20 a month,” says Rausch. “I’m excited that Prime customers just have unlimited access to a world-class foundational AI assistant as part of their Prime benefits.”

        If you’re brave enough to want to run the demonstrably insecure AI assistant OpenClaw, several clouds have already started offering it as a service.

OpenClaw, the name its developer Peter Steinberger settled on after changing from Clawdbot to Moltbot, is a platform for AI agents. Users can provide it with their credentials to various online services and prompt OpenClaw to operate them by issuing instructions in messaging apps like Telegram or WhatsApp. Steinberger says it “clears your inbox, sends emails, manages your calendar, checks you in for flights.”

Using OpenClaw’s AI features requires access to an AI model, either by connecting to an API or by running one locally. The latter possibility apparently sparked a rush to buy Apple’s $599 Mac Mini.

OpenClaw is new and largely untested – just the sort of workload that cloud operators have long said they excel at hosting so users can gather some experience before moving to production.

Clouds were therefore quick to develop OpenClaw-as-a-service oferings.

China’s Tencent Cloud was an early mover, last week delivering a one-click install tool for its Lighthouse service – an offering that allows users to deploy a small server and install an app or environment and run it for a few dollars a month.

DigitalOcean delivered a similar set of instructions a couple of days later, and aimed them at its Droplets IaaS offering.

Alibaba Cloud launched its offering today and made it available in 19 regions, starting at $4/month, and using its simple application server – its equivalent of Lighthouse or Droplets. Interestingly, the Chinese giant says it will soon offer OpenClaw on its Elastic Compute Service – its full-fat IaaS equivalent to AWS EC2 – and on its Elastic Desktop Service, suggesting the chance to rent a cloudy PC to run an AI assistant.

Kill it with fire

Analyst firm Gartner has used uncharacteristically strong language to recommend against using OpenClaw.

In new advice titled “OpenClaw Agentic Productivity Comes With Unacceptable Cybersecurity Risk,” the firm describes the software as “a dangerous preview of agentic AI, demonstrating high utility but exposing enterprises to ‘insecure by default’ risks like plaintext credential storage.”

“Shadow deployment of OpenClaw creates single points of failure, as compromised hosts expose API keys, OAuth tokens, and sensitive conversations to attackers,” the firm adds, before recommending that businesses should immediately block OpenClaw downloads and traffic and stop traffic to the software.

Next, search for any users accessing OpenClaw and tell them to stop because using the software probably involves breaching security controls.

AI agents can't yet pull off fully autonomous cyberattacks - but they are already very helpful to crims

If you must run it, Gartner recommends doing so only in isolated nonproduction virtual machines with throwaway credentials.

“It is not enterprise software. There is no promise of quality, no vendor support, no SLA… it ships without authentication enforced by default. It is not a SaaS product that you can manage via a corporate admin panel,” Gartner advises.

The firm also recommends rotating any credentials OpenClaw touches, as the AI tool’s use of plaintext storage and shabby security mean there’s a chance malefactors can use the login details for evil. So maybe don’t rush to use those cloudy OpenClaw services at work? Or anywhere? ®

        Amazon shares plunged more than 10% in extended trading Thursday after the company posted mixed fourth-quarter earnings and boosted its 2026 spending forecast to $200 billion.

Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.95 vs. $1.97 estimated

Revenue: $213.39 billion vs. $211.33 billion estimated

Wall Street was also looking at other key revenue numbers:

Amazon Web Services: $35.58 billion vs. $34.93 billion expected, according to StreetAccount

Advertising: $21.32 billion vs. $21.16 billion expected, according to StreetAccount

Amazon said it expects capital expenditures to continue to climb higher this year as it aggressively invests in data centers and other infrastructure to meet a surge in artificial intelligence demand.

The company projected capex to hit $200 billion this year, while analysts were expecting $146.6 billion, according to FactSet. Amazon's capital expenditures were roughly $131 billion in 2025.

"With such strong demand for our existing offerings and seminal opportunities like AI, chips, robotics, low earth orbit satellites, we expect to invest about $200 billion in capital expenditures across Amazon in 2026, and anticipate strong long-term return on invested capital," CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement.

During a conference call with investors, Jassy said that spending would "predominantly" go to AWS, where non-AI workloads are "growing at a faster rate than we anticipated." Last October, Amazon opened its $11 billion AI data center called Project Rainier, built exclusively to run workloads from Anthropic.

"We have very high demand," Jassy said. "Customers really want AWS for core and AI workloads, and we're monetizing capacity as fast as we can install it."

Tech companies have laid out aggressive spending plans on artificial intelligence, committing to invest billions. Google parent Alphabet said Wednesday it expects to spend between $175 billion and $185 billion in 2026, while Meta said its capital expenditures could nearly double from last year to $115 billion to $135 billion.

Revenue in Amazon's cloud computing unit expanded 24% during the fourth quarter, topping analysts' estimates for 21.4% growth. Jassy said it was AWS' "fastest growth in 13 quarters."

While Amazon remains the cloud infrastructure leader, it has been trying to fight the perception that it's losing ground to Google and Microsoft in the market. Last week, Microsoft Azure recorded growth of 39%. Google's cloud revenue increased about 48%, the fastest growth since 2021.

For the current quarter, Amazon said it expects sales to be between $173.5 billion and $178.5 billion, representing growth of 11% to 15%. Analysts polled by LSEG were expecting $175.6 billion.

Net income for the fourth quarter was $21.19 billion, or $1.95 per share, compared to $20 billion, or $1.86 per share, a year ago.

The results come as Amazon continues to downsize its head count. The company said last week it would lay off about 16,000 corporate employees, after cutting roughly 14,000 staffers last October.

Amazon had 1.57 million employees globally as of the end of December, an increase of 1% year over year. That figure is primarily comprised of its warehouse workforce.

The company's advertising business continues to hum along. Revenue grew 23% year over year to $21.3 billion during the quarter.

        We’re upgrading our smartest model.

The new Claude Opus 4.6 improves on its predecessor’s coding skills. It plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, can operate more reliably in larger codebases, and has better code review and debugging skills to catch its own mistakes. And, in a first for our Opus-class models, Opus 4.6 features a 1M token context window in beta.

Opus 4.6 can also apply its improved abilities to a range of everyday work tasks: running financial analyses, doing research, and using and creating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. Within Cowork, where Claude can multitask autonomously, Opus 4.6 can put all these skills to work on your behalf.

The model’s performance is state-of-the-art on several evaluations. For example, it achieves the highest score on the agentic coding evaluation Terminal-Bench 2.0 and leads all other frontier models on Humanity’s Last Exam, a complex multidisciplinary reasoning test. On GDPval-AA—an evaluation of performance on economically valuable knowledge work tasks in finance, legal, and other domains1—Opus 4.6 outperforms the industry’s next-best model (OpenAI’s GPT-5.2) by around 144 Elo points,2 and its own predecessor (Claude Opus 4.5) by 190 points. Opus 4.6 also performs better than any other model on BrowseComp, which measures a model’s ability to locate hard-to-find information online.

As we show in our extensive system card, Opus 4.6 also shows an overall safety profile as good as, or better than, any other frontier model in the industry, with low rates of misaligned behavior across safety evaluations.

In Claude Code, you can now assemble agent teams to work on tasks together. On the API, Claude can use compaction to summarize its own context and perform longer-running tasks without bumping up against limits. We’re also introducing adaptive thinking, where the model can pick up on contextual clues about how much to use its extended thinking, and new effort controls to give developers more control over intelligence, speed, and cost.

We’ve made substantial upgrades to Claude in Excel, and we’re releasing Claude in PowerPoint in a research preview. This makes Claude much more capable for everyday work.

Claude Opus 4.6 is available today on claude.ai, our API, and all major cloud platforms. If you’re a developer, use claude-opus-4-6 via the Claude API. Pricing remains the same at $5/$25 per million tokens; for full details, see our pricing page.

We cover the model, our new product updates, our evaluations, and our extensive safety testing in depth below.

First impressions

We build Claude with Claude. Our engineers write code with Claude Code every day, and every new model first gets tested on our own work. With Opus 4.6, we’ve found that the model brings more focus to the most challenging parts of a task without being told to, moves quickly through the more straightforward parts, handles ambiguous problems with better judgment, and stays productive over longer sessions.

Opus 4.6 often thinks more deeply and more carefully revisits its reasoning before settling on an answer. This produces better results on harder problems, but can add cost and latency on simpler ones. If you’re finding that the model is overthinking on a given task, we recommend dialing effort down from its default setting (high) to medium. You can control this easily with the /effort parameter.

Here are some of the things our Early Access partners told us about Claude Opus 4.6, including its propensity to work autonomously without hand-holding, its success where previous models failed, and its effect on how teams work:

Evaluating Claude Opus 4.6

Across agentic coding, computer use, tool use, search, and finance, Opus 4.6 is an industry-leading model, often by a wide margin. The table below shows how Claude Opus 4.6 compares to our previous models and to other industry models on a variety of benchmarks.

Opus 4.6 is much better at retrieving relevant information from large sets of documents. This extends to long-context tasks, where it holds and tracks information over hundreds of thousands of tokens with less drift, and picks up buried details that even Opus 4.5 would miss.

A common complaint about AI models is “context rot,” where performance degrades as conversations exceed a certain number of tokens. Opus 4.6 performs markedly better than its predecessors: on the 8-needle 1M variant of MRCR v2—a needle-in-a-haystack benchmark that tests a model’s ability to retrieve information “hidden” in vast amounts of text—Opus 4.6 scores 76%, whereas Sonnet 4.5 scores just 18.5%. This is a qualitative shift in how much context a model can actually use while maintaining peak performance.

All in all, Opus 4.6 is better at finding information across long contexts, better at reasoning after absorbing that information, and has substantially better expert-level reasoning abilities in general.

Finally, the charts below show how Claude Opus 4.6 performs on a variety of benchmarks that assess its software engineering skills, multilingual coding ability, long-term coherence, cybersecurity capabilities, and its life sciences knowledge.

A step forward on safety

These intelligence gains do not come at the cost of safety. On our automated behavioral audit, Opus 4.6 showed a low rate of misaligned behaviors such as deception, sycophancy, encouragement of user delusions, and cooperation with misuse. Overall, it is just as well-aligned as its predecessor, Claude Opus 4.5, which was our most-aligned frontier model to date. Opus 4.6 also shows the lowest rate of over-refusals—where the model fails to answer benign queries—of any recent Claude model.

For Claude Opus 4.6, we ran the most comprehensive set of safety evaluations of any model, applying many different tests for the first time and upgrading several that we’ve used before. We included new evaluations for user wellbeing, more complex tests of the model’s ability to refuse potentially dangerous requests, and updated evaluations of the model’s ability to surreptitiously perform harmful actions. We also experimented with new methods from interpretability, the science of the inner workings of AI models, to begin to understand why the model behaves in certain ways—and, ultimately, to catch problems that standard testing might miss.

A detailed description of all capability and safety evaluations is available in the Claude Opus 4.6 system card.

We’ve also applied new safeguards in areas where Opus 4.6 shows particular strengths that might be put to dangerous as well as beneficial uses. In particular, since the model shows enhanced cybersecurity abilities, we’ve developed six new cybersecurity probes—methods of detecting harmful responses—to help us track different forms of potential misuse.

We’re also accelerating the cyberdefensive uses of the model, using it to help find and patch vulnerabilities in open-source software (as we describe in our new cybersecurity blog post). We think it’s critical that cyberdefenders use AI models like Claude to help level the playing field. Cybersecurity moves fast, and we’ll be adjusting and updating our safeguards as we learn more about potential threats; in the near future, we may institute real-time intervention to block abuse.

We’ve made substantial updates across Claude, Claude Code, and the Claude Developer Platform to let Opus 4.6 perform at its best.

Claude Developer Platform

On the API, we’re giving developers better control over model effort and more flexibility for long-running agents. To do so, we’re introducing the following features:

Adaptive thinking. Previously, developers only had a binary choice between enabling or disabling extended thinking. Now, with adaptive thinking, Claude can decide when deeper reasoning would be helpful. At the default effort level (high), the model uses extended thinking when useful, but developers can adjust the effort level to make it more or less selective.

Effort. There are now four effort levels to choose from: low, medium, high (default), and max. We encourage developers to experiment with different options to find what works best.

Context compaction (beta). Long-running conversations and agentic tasks often hit the context window. Context compaction automatically summarizes and replaces older context when the conversation approaches a configurable threshold, letting Claude perform longer tasks without hitting limits.

1M token context (beta). Opus 4.6 is our first Opus-class model with 1M token context. Premium pricing applies for prompts exceeding 200k tokens ($10/$37.50 per million input/output tokens).

128k output tokens. Opus 4.6 supports outputs of up to 128k tokens, which lets Claude complete larger-output tasks without breaking them into multiple requests.

US-only inference. For workloads that need to run in the United States, US-only inference is available at 1.1× token pricing.

Product updates

Across Claude and Claude Code, we’ve added features that allow knowledge workers and developers to tackle harder tasks with more of the tools they use every day.

We’ve introduced agent teams in Claude Code as a research preview. You can now spin up multiple agents that work in parallel as a team and coordinate autonomously—best for tasks that split into independent, read-heavy work like codebase reviews. You can take over any subagent directly using Shift+Up/Down or tmux.

Claude now also works better with the office tools you already use. Claude in Excel handles long-running and harder tasks with improved performance, and can plan before acting, ingest unstructured data and infer the right structure without guidance, and handle multi-step changes in one pass. Pair that with Claude in PowerPoint, and you can first process and structure your data in Excel, then bring it to life visually in PowerPoint. Claude reads your layouts, fonts, and slide masters to stay on brand, whether you’re building from a template or generating a full deck from a description. Claude in PowerPoint is now available in research preview for Max, Team, and Enterprise plans.

        <hr/>
        Alphabet beat on the top and bottom lines in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, and said it expects to significantly increase spending on artificial intelligence in 2026.

The stock fell as much as 3% in extended trading.

Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.82 vs. $2.63 estimated

Revenue: $113.83 billion vs. $111.43 billion estimated

Wall Street was also watching several other numbers in the report:

Google Cloud: $17.66 billion vs. $16.18 billion, according to StreetAccount

YouTube advertising: $11.38 billion vs. $11.84 billion, according to StreetAccount

Traffic acquisition costs: $16.59 billion vs. $16.20 billion, according to StreetAccount

Alphabet said it expects 2026 capital expenditures to be in the range of $175 billion to $185 billion. The top end of that forecast would be more than double its 2025 spend. The company said in October that it expected "a significant increase" to capex in 2026.

The company's capex spend will go toward investing in AI compute capacity for Google DeepMind and to meet "significant cloud customer demand as well as strategic investments in other bets," Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi told analysts on a call Wednesday. She added that it would be used to "improve the user experience and drive higher advertiser ROI in Google services."

The company saw revenue increase almost 18% year over year. Net income came in at $34.46 billion, up almost 30% compared to the year prior.

Advertising revenue came in at $82.28 billion, up 13.5% from a year ago. Revenue for YouTube ads increased almost 9% to $11.38 billion, but it fell short of analysts' expectations of $11.84 billion.

Ashkenazi said "advertising results were negatively affected from the lapping of the strong spend on U.S. election in the fourth quarter of 2024."

Google Cloud beat Wall Street's expectations, recording a nearly 48% increase in revenue from a year ago. Google's Cloud unit houses most of the company's AI services and products.

That business's backlog increased 55% sequentially and more than doubled year over year, reaching $240 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, said Ashkenazi.

Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the call Wednesday that its Gemini AI app now has more than 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million monthly active users last quarter.

"As we scale, we are getting dramatically more efficient," Pichai said. "We were able to lower Gemini serving unit costs by 78% over 2025 through model optimizations, efficiency and utilization improvements."

Other Bets, which includes the company's life sciences unit Verily and self-driving car unit Waymo, reported revenue of $370 million during the quarter, down 7.5% from a year ago. Alphabet reported Other Bets' loss of $3.61 billion, a year-over-year increase of more than 200%.

Waymo took a $2.1 billion stock-based compensation charge for the quarter, as it raised a new funding round at a $16 billion valuation. The majority of the charge was reflected in expenses for research and development, Ashkenazi said.

The self-driving wing of Alphabet ended 2025 having served 15 million trips in five major U.S. markets, including Austin, Texas; Atlanta; Los Angeles; Phoenix; and the San Francisco Bay Area. In January, Waymo began operating its service in Miami.

        <hr/>
        YouTube generated more than $60 billion in revenue for 2025, including both advertising and subscriptions, the first time parent company Alphabet has broken out total revenue for the platform.

That makes YouTube much larger than subscription-streaming leader Netflix, which reported $45.18 billion in revenue for full-year 2025. Indeed, the top-line number for YouTube was more than any other entertainment company except Disney ($95.7 billion in revenue for calendar year 2025).

Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, said in prepared remarks that the company now has over 325 million paid subscriptions across consumer services, including YouTube Premium, YouTube TV and Google One.

Meanwhile, YouTube also notched its biggest-ever ad sales number to date for the fourth quarter of 2025. However, that ad haul came in below Wall Street forecasts.

In the last three months of the year, YouTube’s global ad revenue totaled $11.38 billion, a year-over-year increase of 8.7%, parent company Alphabet reported. Wall Street analysts on average forecast YouTube ad revenue coming in at $11.84 billion, per StreetAccount. On the brand advertising front, YouTube saw lower political ad spending in the most recent quarter compared with Q4 2024.

According to Pichai, the NFL saw its highest paid-subscriber total for the Sunday Ticket out-of-market package available through YouTube for the most recent season (but he didn’t say what that number was). In October 2025, viewers watched more than 700 million hours of podcasts on YouTube on TVs, up 70% year over year, he said.

Overall, Alphabet, also the parent of Google, posted Q4 revenue of $113.8 billion (up 18%) and net income of $34.5 billion (up 30%), or $2.82 per share. That handily topped analyst consensus estimates for $111.43 billion revenue and EPS of $2.63.

Alphabet is seeing its AI investments and infrastructure “drive revenue and growth across the board,” according to Pichai. He said that to “meet customer demand and capitalize on the growing opportunities we have ahead of us,” the company expects capital expenses to be $175 billion to $185 billion for 2026, which would be as much as double the $91.4 billion in capex for 2025.

During the quarter, YouTube inked a deal with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for exclusive global rights to the Oscars awards ceremony beginning in 2029 and running through 2033, nabbing the media rights from ABC. Last month the BBC announced a partnership with YouTube under which the U.K. broadcaster will produce original content for the platform and launch new YouTube channels aimed at children and young adults.

YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, in his 2026 letter to the community outlining the platform’s priorities for the year, touted new AI tools coming for creators and said more than 1 million channels used YouTube’s AI tools daily in December 2025. At the same time, the rise of artificial intelligence has raised concerns about “AI slop,” he said, and YouTube is working on “reducing the spread of low-quality, repetitive content.”

        Snap shares were up over 2% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the Snapchat parent released fourth-quarter earnings that beat on sales.

The company also announced a $500 million stock repurchase program.

Here is how the company did compared with Wall Street's expectations:

Earnings per share: 3 cents. That figure is not comparable to analysts' estimates.

Revenue: $1.72 billion vs. $1.70 billion expected, according to LSEG

Global daily active users: 474 million vs. 478 million expected, according to StreetAccount

Global average revenue per user (ARPU): $3.62 vs. $3.56 expected, according to StreetAccount

The social media company said first-quarter revenue will be in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.53 billion, which is below analyst estimates of $1.55 billion.

Sales in Snap's fourth quarter rose 10% year over year, while net income was $45.2 million, which was up nearly 400% from the $9.1 million it reported a year ago.

Snap said that fourth-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, was $358 million, topping the $300 million that StreetAccount was projecting.

The company also said that its adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter will be between $170 million and $190 million. That midpoint is higher than StreetAccount's estimates of $178 million.

Snap's fourth-quarter global DAU dropped by 3 million quarter-over-quarter, which the company attributed to a reduction in marketing spending "in order to focus on more profitable growth," according to a letter to investors.

Additionally, Snap said that due to Australia's social media minimum age act, the company "implemented platform-level age verification" in that country during the fourth quarter that resulted "in the removal of approximately 400,000 accounts."

The company said that DAU for the North American region was 94 million, lower than the 97 million that Wall Street was projecting.

Snap shares dipped slightly in after-hours trading when an analyst asked the company's executives during an earnings call about potential regulatory challenges.

"Obviously, there's quite a bit working its way to the court system right now that would further restrict the use of Snapchat for our community," Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said during the earnings call about the regulatory environment. Still, he said, the company's global ad sales stemming from users under the age of 18 is "not material."

"Looking at the revenue-generating potential of the business looking forward, we're not overly concerned about the changing regulatory environment," Spiegel said.

In the letter, Snap said it plans to focus on growing its subscription-related offerings, like Snapchat+ and the recently debuted Memories Storage Plans. The company said overall subscribers to those services grew 71% year over year to 24 million in the fourth quarter.

"Certainly memory storage plans were a big driver of the subscriber growth that we've seen recently," Spiegel said.

Last week, Snap announced that it had created a wholly owned subsidiary named Specs Inc. that will develop and market the company's augmented reality glasses.

"We're super excited about what's ahead this year with the launch of Specs, and obviously graduating from the R&D phase of Specs to broader consumer adoption," Spiegel said about the company's upcoming AR glasses slated to debut in 2026.

Because the company's AR glasses "appeals to a different audience segment than the core Snapchat audience," Spiegel said, it's "going to be really important for us to develop a standalone brand identity for Specs."

Spiegel said that while "there may be opportunities to raise additional capital" for the company's AR glasses-related efforts in the future, Snap will need to be "balancing" the outside investment with its "own ownership interest and any potential dilution."

        Pinterest CEO Bill Ready rebuked staffers who created an internal tool to track layoffs at the company, and fired those involved.

"Healthy debate and dissent are expected, that's how we make our decisions," Ready said at a companywide meeting last week, according to audio obtained by CNBC. "But there's a clear line between constructive debate and behavior that's obstructionist."

Pinterest announced on Jan. 27 that it would lay off less than 15% of its workforce and cut back on office space as part of a broader restructuring aimed at directing resources toward artificial intelligence projects. The company said it expects the layoffs will be complete by the end of September.

Following the announcement, Pinterest's technology chief addressed the layoffs in a meeting. Some employees asked which teams were impacted and whether more job cuts were coming, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the meeting was private.

Several Pinterest engineers then created an internal software tool to try and quantify the layoffs. Pinterest fired the engineers on Friday, the person said. It's unclear how many employees were let go.

Ready defended the moves at an all-hands meeting on Friday, saying Pinterest was facing a "critical moment" in the industry. Employees should consider a job elsewhere if they're "working against the direction of the company" and disagree with its mission, he said.

Ready said Pinterest wouldn't disclose detailed information about the layoffs out of a concern for staffers' privacy.

"I know people have natural curiosity around these things," Ready said. "We shared some of those major structural changes. The smaller ones, those will be communicated at the team level."

A Pinterest spokesperson confirmed the engineer incident and town hall meeting, but declined to comment on the firings.

"After being clearly informed that Pinterest would not broadly share information identifying impacted employees, two engineers wrote custom scripts improperly accessing confidential company information to identify the locations and names of all dismissed employees and then shared it more broadly," the spokesperson said. "This was a clear violation of Pinterest policy and of their former colleagues' privacy."

After this article was published, several Pinterest employees contacted CNBC and disputed the company's characterization of the incident.

Pinterest fired the engineers after they posted instructions showing how to prompt the company's staff directory to show who was laid off, the employees said. The employees said Pinterest's claim that the engineers created custom software was inaccurate, and said the directory tool is accessible to anyone in the company.

Pinterest has been investing heavily in AI to surface more personalized and relevant content, and to keep users returning to its platform. It's also rolled out automated tools for marketers in an effort to better compete with digital ad leaders Meta and Google .

Investors have raised concerns around whether the increasing popularity of consumer chatbots from OpenAI, Google and others could steal users and ad dollars away from Pinterest. There's particular consternation around the use of AI agents for shopping, "which compresses the market of discovery and purchase on competing platforms," Wedbush analysts wrote in a research note last week.

Pinterest shares are down 20% so far this year after dropping 11% in 2025.

"We can't tolerate from each other obstructionism, especially when we have a mission that is so meaningful but also where the odds are stacked against us," Ready said. "We think we can beat those odds, but as a small purpose driven player competing against the largest companies in the history of the world, the only way that we succeed is if we work together, constructively, with clarity and focus."

More recently, Pinterest's advertising sales slowed as some large U.S. retailers weathered the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policies.

Tech companies have continued to downsize this year as they look for more ways to increase efficiencies and invest in AI. Amazon last week said it would lay off about 16,000 corporate employees, after it let go 14,000 staffers in October. Meta cut about 10% of staff in its Reality Labs unit, while design software maker Autodesk slashed about 7% of its workforce.

        <hr/>
        Newsletter platform Substack is notifying users of a data breach after attackers stole their email addresses and phone numbers in October 2025.

Although the incident occurred four months ago, CEO Chris Best told affected users that Substack only discovered the breach this week. However, while the attackers stole some users' data, Best added that they didn't access credentials or financial information.

"On February 3rd, we identified evidence of a problem with our systems that allowed an unauthorized third party to access limited user data without permission, including email addresses, phone numbers, and other internal metadata," Best said in breach notification emails sent today.

"This data was accessed in October 2025. Importantly, credit card numbers, passwords, and financial information were not accessed."

Although Substack has yet to share how many users were affected by the incident, on Monday, a threat actor leaked a database on the BreachForums hacking forum containing 697,313 records of allegedly stolen data.

They also claim to have scraped the data and noted that "the scraping method used was noisy and patched fast."

While it didn't explain how the attacker gained access to the stolen data or reveal the full impact of the data breach, Substack says it has addressed the flaw exploited in the attack and warned of potential phishing attempts that could exploit the stolen information.

"We have fixed the problem with our system that allowed this to happen," Best added. "We do not have evidence that this information is being misused, but we encourage you to take extra caution with any emails or text messages you receive that may be suspicious."

A Substack spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today.

Almost six years ago, in July 2020, Substack accidentally exposed some users' email addresses in a privacy policy update email by including them in the 'to' line instead of the 'bcc' field.

Since its launch in 2017, Substack has gained popularity among independent journalists and content creators, reaching five million paid subscriptions by March 2025.
